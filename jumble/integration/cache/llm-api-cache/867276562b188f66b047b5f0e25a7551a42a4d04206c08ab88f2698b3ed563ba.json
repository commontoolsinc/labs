Design a simple charm that can count values in an array or object\n3. Implement the core counting logic to handle different data types (arrays, objects, strings)\n4. Create a user-friendly output format that displays the count results\n5. Add error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases\n</steps>\n\n<specification>\nThis charm counts the values in the provided input data. It analyzes the input and returns a count of elements based on the data type. For arrays, it counts the number of elements. For objects, it counts the number of key-value pairs. For strings, it counts the number of characters. For numbers, it simply returns 1 (as a single value). The charm provides a simple way to get a quick count of elements in any data structure, which is useful for data analysis, validation, or debugging purposes. The output includes both the count and the type of data that was counted to provide context.\n</specification>\n\n<data_model>\nInput: Any → can be array, object, string, number, boolean, or null\nProcess: Input → analyze type → count elements → format output\nOutput: { count: number, type: string, [details]: object }\n\nThe charm processes data by:\n1. Determining the type of the input data\n2. Counting elements based on the type:\n   - Arrays: number of elements\n   - Objects: number of key-value pairs\n   - Strings: number of characters\n   - Other primitives: count as 1\n3. Returning a structured result with the count and type information\n\nFor complex nested structures, the charm can optionally provide detailed counts of nested elements.\n</data_model>"
