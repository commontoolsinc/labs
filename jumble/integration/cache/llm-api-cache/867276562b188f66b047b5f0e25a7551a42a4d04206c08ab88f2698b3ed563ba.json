First step of the plan\n2. Second step of the plan\n3. ...\n</steps>\n\n(include ~1 paragraph)\n<specification>\nA clear description of what the charm does, its purpose, and functionality.\nInclude a clear explanation of how it works and what problems it solves.\nFor EDIT and IMAGINE, explain how it builds upon or differs from the existing charm.\n</specification>\n\n<data_model>\nSketch key entity types as type signature.\nExplain how data is processed and output with arrow diagrams.\nFor EDIT and IMAGINE, explain any changes to the existing data model.\nInclude how this charm uses any referenced data from other charms.\n</data_model>\n\nDO NOT GENERATE A SCHEMA.\n"
