Design a simple charm that counts values in an array or object\n3. Define the input/output data model for the charm\n4. Plan the implementation logic to handle different data types (arrays, objects, etc.)\n5. Consider edge cases like empty inputs, non-countable inputs, etc.\n</steps>\n\n<specification>\nThis charm counts the number of values in the provided input data. It's designed to be flexible, accepting various data types and returning a count of their elements or properties. For arrays, it counts the number of elements; for objects, it counts the number of properties; for strings, it counts the number of characters; and for other primitive values, it returns 1. The charm provides a simple utility function that helps users quickly determine the size or length of their data without having to write custom counting logic for different data types.\n</specification>\n\n<data_model>\nInput: Any → can be array, object, string, or primitive value\nProcess: Count elements/properties/characters based on input type\nOutput: Number → the count of values\n\nArray[T] → count number of elements → Number\nObject → count number of properties → Number\nString → count number of characters → Number\nPrimitive (number, boolean, etc.) → return 1 → Number\nnull/undefined → return 0 → Number\n\nThe charm processes the input data by first determining its type, then applying the appropriate counting logic based on that type.\n</data_model>"
