Design a simple charm that counts values in an array or object\n3. Define the input/output data model for the charm\n4. Plan the implementation logic to handle different data types (arrays, objects, etc.)\n5. Consider edge cases like empty inputs, non-countable inputs, etc.\n</steps>\n\n<specification>\nThis charm will count the values in the input data provided to it. The purpose is to analyze the input and return a count of its elements or properties. For arrays, it will count the number of elements. For objects, it will count the number of properties. For strings, it will count the number of characters. For other primitive values (numbers, booleans, null), it will return 0 or 1 depending on whether the value exists. This charm provides a simple utility function that can be useful in data analysis, validation, or when making decisions based on the size of data structures.\n</specification>\n\n<data_model>\nInput: any → can be array, object, string, number, boolean, or null\nProcess: Count elements/properties/characters based on input type\nOutput: number → the count of values\n\nProcessing flow:\n- Array input [a, b, c] → Count: 3\n- Object input {a: 1, b: 2} → Count: 2\n- String input \"hello\" → Count: 5\n- Number input 42 → Count: 1\n- Boolean input true → Count: 1\n- Null input null → Count: 0\n- Undefined input undefined → Count: 0\n</data_model>"
