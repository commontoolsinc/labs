First step of the plan\n2. Second step of the plan\n3. ...\n</steps>\n\n(include ~1 paragraph)\n<specification>\nA clear description of what the charm does, its purpose, and functionality.\nInclude a clear explanation of how it works and what problems it solves.\nFor EDIT and IMAGINE, explain how it builds upon or differs from the existing charm.\n</specification>\n\n<data_model>\nList key actions and the data types they affect.\ne.g add(title, description) -> TodoItem(title, description, completed)\nedit(item: TodoItem, { description, title, completed }) -> TodoItem(title, description, completed)\ndelete(item: TodoItem) -> void\n\nInclude how this charm uses any referenced data.\n</data_model>\n\nDO NOT GENERATE A SCHEMA.\n"

Ensure the output is clear and informative with proper formatting\n</steps>\n\n<specification>\nThis charm counts the number of values in the provided input. It's designed to be flexible, accepting various data types and providing a count of their elements or properties. For arrays, it counts the number of elements; for objects, it counts the number of properties; for strings, it counts the number of characters; and for numbers, it returns 1. The charm handles edge cases like null or undefined values by returning 0. This provides users with a quick way to determine the size or length of their current data without having to write custom counting logic for different data types.\n</specification>\n\n<data_model>\ncount(input: any) -> { count: number, type: string }\n- input: Can be any data type (array, object, string, number, boolean, null, undefined)\n- Returns an object containing the count of values and the type of the input\n- For arrays: Returns the number of elements\n- For objects: Returns the number of properties\n- For strings: Returns the number of characters\n- For numbers, booleans: Returns 1\n- For null, undefined: Returns 0\n</data_model>"
