First step of the plan\n2. Second step of the plan\n3. ...\n</steps>\n\n(include ~1 paragraph)\n<specification>\nA clear description of what the charm does, its purpose, and functionality.\nInclude a clear explanation of how it works and what problems it solves.\nFor EDIT and IMAGINE, explain how it builds upon or differs from the existing charm.\n</specification>\n\n<data_model>\nList key actions and the data types they affect.\ne.g add(title, description) -> TodoItem(title, description, completed)\nedit(item: TodoItem, { description, title, completed }) -> TodoItem(title, description, completed)\ndelete(item: TodoItem) -> void\n\nInclude how this charm uses any referenced data.\n</data_model>\n\nDO NOT GENERATE A SCHEMA.\n"

Define the input data structure to accept various types of collections\n4. Implement the counting logic to handle different data types (arrays, objects, strings)\n5. Format and return the count results in a clear, user-friendly way\n</steps>\n\n<specification>\nThis charm counts the number of values in the provided input data. It's designed to be flexible, accepting various data types such as arrays, objects, strings, or numbers, and returns a count of the elements or properties. For arrays, it counts the number of elements; for objects, it counts the number of properties; for strings, it counts the number of characters; and for numbers or other primitive values, it returns 1. This provides a quick way to understand the size or length of any data structure without having to manually count elements.\n</specification>\n\n<data_model>\ncount(input: any) -> { count: number, type: string }\n- input: Can be any data type (array, object, string, number, boolean)\n- Returns an object containing:\n  - count: The number of elements/properties/characters\n  - type: The type of the input data (e.g., \"array\", \"object\", \"string\")\n\nFor arrays: Returns the length of the array\nFor objects: Returns the number of own enumerable properties\nFor strings: Returns the number of characters\nFor numbers/booleans/null/undefined: Returns 1\n</data_model>"
