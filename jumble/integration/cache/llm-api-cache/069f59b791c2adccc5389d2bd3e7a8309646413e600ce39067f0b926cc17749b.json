Define the input data structure to accept various types of collections\n4. Implement the counting logic to handle different data types (arrays, objects, strings)\n5. Format and return the count results in a clear, user-friendly way\n</steps>\n\n<specification>\nThis charm counts the values in a provided data structure. It's designed to be flexible, accepting various types of input data such as arrays, objects, strings, or numbers, and returns the count of elements or properties. For arrays, it counts the number of elements; for objects, it counts the number of properties; for strings, it counts the number of characters; and for numbers, it simply returns 1. The charm provides a simple way to get a quick count of items without having to write custom counting logic, making it useful for data analysis, validation, or informational purposes.\n</specification>\n\n<data_model>\ncount(input: any) -> { count: number, type: string }\n- input: Can be an array, object, string, number, or boolean\n- Returns an object containing the count and the type of the input\n- For arrays: Returns the number of elements\n- For objects: Returns the number of properties\n- For strings: Returns the number of characters\n- For numbers and booleans: Returns 1\n- For null or undefined: Returns 0\n</data_model>"
