Focus on the simplest implementation that works with the provided schema.\n\n<task>\nGiven a user's feature request and an existing data schema, you will:\n1. Create a short title (2-5 words) that names the artifact\n2. Create a one-sentence description in the format \"A <artifact> to <goal>\"\n3. Create a concise specification (3-5 sentences max) that works with the existing schema\n4. Generate a brief implementation plan (3 steps max)\n5.

Keep it minimal:\n   - Include only essential fields (5-7 properties max)\n   - Focus on the core functionality\n   - If user requested complex features, simplify for this first version\n\n2. Each property should have:\n   - A descriptive \"title\" field\n   - A brief \"description\" field\n   - A sensible default value where appropriate\n\n3. Example of a simple schema:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"title\": \"Note List\",\n  \"description\": \"A simple note list for the user\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"notes\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"title\": \"Notes\",\n      \"description\": \"List of user notes\",\n      \"default\": [],\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"title\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"title\": \"Title\",\n            \"description\": \"Title of the note\",\n            \"default\": \"New Note\"\n          },\n          \"content\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"title\": \"Content\",\n            \"description\": \"Content of the note\"\n          },\n          \"created\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"format\": \"date-time\",\n            \"title\": \"Created Date\",\n            \"description\": \"When the note was created\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"title\", \"content\"]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"title\", \"content\"]\n}\n```\n\nGUIDELINES:\n- Aim for the simplest possible solution that works with the existing schema\n- The specification should take into account the existing schema structure\n- Focus on what can be achieved quickly with the existing data model\n- Avoid suggesting modifications to the schema if possible\n</schema_guidelines>\n\n<high_level>\nIMPORTANT:\n- Focus on the simplest working version\n- Aim for fewer fields rather than more\n- But still capture all the important state the user is creating\n- The user can always iterate and improve the solution later\n</high_level>\n",
