/**
 * A guardrail principal sets the policies for
 *  - @param canFlowTo â€“ flow _outside_ of the current runtime, e.g. via
 *    capabilities (network, ...), to other runtimes and to other users.
 *  - @param declassifiers - conditions for switching to more permissive
 *    guardrails, typically via modules that declassify data, i.e. make it less
 *    sensitive and thus allow more permissive flows.
 *
 * Both can be empty.
 *
 * Empty `canFlowTo` means that this guardrail doesn't loosen any prior
 * restrictions on flow.
 *
 * Empty `declassifiers` means that this guardrail is an end-point, i.e. there
 * is no path from here to further release (however, there might be different
 * paths)
 *
 * PUBLIC is a special flow principal that allows any flow.
