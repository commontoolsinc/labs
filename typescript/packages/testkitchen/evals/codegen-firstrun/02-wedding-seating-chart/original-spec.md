# Wedding Seating Chart

I'm planning a wedding, I've created a spreadsheet to track all of our RSVPs, and now I need to create a seating plan.

We have a head table for 10 people, and then we have 10 additional tables of 8 people each.

I want to be able to paste-in a CSV of guests, with the following columns:

Name,PlusOne,Affiliation,Description

Here is an example of the CSV:

David Chen,TRUE,Bride,Sarah's father - Professor at UW Seattle
Lisa Chen,FALSE,Bride,Sarah's mother - Pediatrician in Seattle
Kevin Chen,TRUE,Bride,Sarah's brother - Software engineer at Amazon
Emily O'Connor,FALSE,Groom,Michael's mother - High school principal in Boston
Patrick O'Connor,FALSE,Groom,Michael's father - Partner at Boston law firm
Katie O'Connor,TRUE,Groom,Michael's sister - Medical resident at Mass General
