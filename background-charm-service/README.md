# Background Charm Service

A service for running background charms with isolation and monitoring
capabilities.

**FIXME(ja): all of this is built on a lie: If update method is async (uses
fetch - like gmail) the handler will "finish" while work is still happening!
Because many updaters are async we don't receive exceptions (mark them as
failing) or know when to properly reschedule them.**

## Overview

The Background Charm Service runs charms in the background with:

- Space-based isolation for charm execution (one web worker per space)
- Isolated execution in web workers to prevent interference
- Automatic charm scheduling and execution based on defined intervals
- Error handling and status tracking for reliable operation
- Simple monitoring and management of background processes

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **BackgroundCharmService** (service.ts)
   - Main orchestrator that coordinates all components
   - Manages service lifecycle and charm discovery
   - Creates and manages SpaceManagers for each space

2. **SpaceManager** (space-manager.ts)
   - Manages charms for a specific space
   - Schedules and tracks charm execution
   - Maintains charm status (enabled/disabled, last run time, errors)
   - Communicates with a dedicated WorkerController

3. **WorkerController** (worker-controller.ts)
   - Manages communication with the Worker
   - Handles message passing and timeout tracking
   - Provides interface for charm execution

4. **Worker** (worker.ts)
   - Runs in an isolated thread
   - Sets up a session for a specific space
   - Handles charm loading and execution
   - Reports results back to the WorkerController

### Execution Flow

1. The service discovers background charms from the central toolshed-system list
   of charms
2. For each unique space, a SpaceManager is created
3. Each SpaceManager creates its own WorkerController with an isolated worker
4. The SpaceManager schedules and executes charms through its WorkerController
5. The worker runs each charm and reports results back
6. The SpaceManager tracks status and schedules re-runs based on results

## Isolation Model

The service provides isolation at multiple levels:

- **Space Isolation**: Each space gets its own SpaceManager and Worker
- **Worker Isolation**: Each WorkerController uses a Web Worker for thread-level
  isolation
- **Session Isolation**: Each worker has its own session with proper permissions
- **Error Isolation**: Errors in one charm do not affect other charms or spaces

This model enables:

- Running charms from different spaces without interference
- Protecting against crashes and resource exhaustion
- Ensuring proper permission boundaries between spaces
- Providing detailed status tracking per charm

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Deno 2.2 or later

### Running the Service

Start the service:

```
TOOLSHED_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 OPERATOR_PASS=your-passphrase deno task start
```

### Environment Variables

- `TOOLSHED_API_URL`: URL to the toolshed API
- `OPERATOR_PASS`: Passphrase for the operator identity
- `POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`: (Optional) Interval for job queue polling
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS`: (Optional) Maximum concurrent jobs per space

### Monitoring

The service provides status information for each space and charm:

- Enabled/disabled status
- Last execution time
- Last success/failure
- Error information for failed charms

## Charm Integration

To create a background charm:

1. Create a charm with a `bgUpdater` stream handler
2. Use the common-updater component to register for background updates
