- you can start local dev using `scripts/start-local-dev.sh`
- read `ct.md` to understand the `ct` binary
- IMPORTANT: when you load the shell in the browser, you may have to complete registration by generating a one-time passphrase (this will persist between sessions)
- use playwright MCP to explore recipes and charms from the browser
  - use ct to support and debug your exporation
- if the user gives an instruction like 'explore packages/patterns/counter.tsx` you should work out how to deploy it using ct, load it in the browser using playwright and explore it based on the recipe's sourcecode
  - then you should describe what you find to the user
- if the user gives no spacename, use the current date + a descriptive suffix e.g. `2025-06-01-counter`
- you can stop the server using `scripts/stop-local-dev.sh`
