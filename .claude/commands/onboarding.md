# Common Tools Repository Onboarding Tour

**Note**: This command provides an interactive tour of the codebase and concepts. If you want to actually set up a development environment and deploy your first pattern, use the `/setup` command instead.

This command provides an interactive tour of the Common Tools platform repository, helping new contributors understand where to find information and how to navigate the codebase effectively.

## Before You Start

**New to this repository?**
- Want to actually deploy a pattern and start coding? → Use `/setup` command
- Want to understand the concepts and codebase structure first? → Continue with this tour

## Getting Started (Essential Foundation)

**Everyone starts here to get oriented:**

**Step 1: What is Common Tools? (Start small)**
- Read only the "What is Common Tools?" section from README.md
- Quote the key description to the user
- Immediately offer the four focused paths:

"Now that you have the basic idea, what would you like to know more about:

- **Programs that run in this platform** (recipes, charms, UI components)
- **The runtime that enables information flow analysis and storage** (runner, builder, storage)
- **The application layer that users access the platform through** (toolshed, shell, CLI)
- **The LLM tooling layer** (Claude commands, subagents, and development workflows)

Which of these interests you most?"

**Step 2: Follow their choice with targeted exploration**
Based on their choice, dive into only the relevant packages and concepts for that area

## Deep Dive Paths

Based on the user's choice in Step 2, follow these focused exploration paths:

### Path A: Programs That Run in the Platform
*"I chose: Programs that run in this platform (recipes, charms, UI components)"*

**Explore in order:**
1. **What are recipes?** - Quote relevant sections from README about reactive programs
2. **Recipe examples** - Show a simple example from `packages/patterns/`
3. **UI components** - Brief look at `packages/ui/` and `ct-` prefixed components
4. **How recipes become charms** - Deployment and linking concepts
5. **Development commands** - `/pattern-dev`, `/imagine-recipe`, `/explore-recipe`

### Path B: Runtime That Enables Information Flow
*"I chose: The runtime that enables information flow analysis and storage"*

**Explore in order:**
1. **Runtime architecture** - Quote architecture sections about distributed runtime
2. **Core packages** - Look at runner, storage, and execution-related packages
3. **Information flow concepts** - How data moves and is tracked
4. **Security model** - Sandbox execution and privacy features
5. **Development setup** - How to work on runtime components

### Path C: Application Layer Users Access
*"I chose: The application layer that users access the platform through"*

**Explore in order:**
1. **Toolshed backend** - Quote from `packages/toolshed/README.md` about hosted platform
2. **Shell frontend** - Quote from `packages/shell/README.md` about user interface
3. **CT CLI** - Run `deno task ct --help` to see available commands
4. **How they work together** - Integration points and data flow
5. **Development workflow** - Running local development environment

### Path D: LLM Tooling Layer
*"I chose: The LLM tooling layer (Claude commands, subagents, and development workflows)"*

**Explore in order:**
1. **Commands overview** - Quote from `.claude/commands/README.md` about available workflows
2. **Command categories** - Recipe development, workflow management, research, etc.
3. **Integration setup** - Quote from `deps.md` about MCP integrations (Linear, Playwright)
4. **Development assistance patterns** - How LLMs help with Common Tools development
5. **Creating new commands** - How this onboarding command was built

## Navigation Support

**Throughout any path, users can access:**
- **Available commands**: List `.claude/commands/` and read `.claude/commands/README.md`
- **Integration setup**: Review `deps.md` for tools and MCP integrations
- **Development guidelines**: Reference `CLAUDE.md` for coding standards
- **Research commands**: Use `/research` to dive deeper into specific areas

## Adventure Branches

**Users can switch paths or dive deeper:**
- From Recipe Development → explore Runtime internals
- From Runtime → understand Application layer integration
- From Application layer → try Recipe development
- Or combine multiple paths based on curiosity

## Completion Indicators

**Each path concludes when the user can:**
- Navigate to relevant information sources independently
- Understand their chosen area's development workflow
- Know what commands/tools to use for their interests
- Have clear next steps for hands-on work

## Notes for Claude

**Critical: This is a guided discovery experience, not a fire-hose lecture:**

- **Start tiny and build** - Don't read multiple files at once. Start with one small section
- **Quote small chunks** - Show 2-3 sentences from files, not entire sections
- **Wait for their reaction** - After each quote, ask what they think and WAIT for response
- **Follow their energy** - Only show more based on what sparked their curiosity
- **Never charge ahead** - Resist the urge to show everything; be patient and responsive
- **Let silence be OK** - Give them time to process and respond

**Example flow:**
1. Read just the "What is Common Tools?" section from README.md
2. Quote the first paragraph: "Common Tools is a new distributed computing platform..."
3. Ask: "What's your first reaction to this?"
4. Wait for user response
5. Based on their response, show ONLY the next relevant small piece
6. Repeat this cycle

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't read README.md + list packages + read commands README all at once
- Don't summarize what you found after reading files
- Don't offer too many paths; the four focused paths are sufficient based on their actual interest

**Key principle:** The user should feel like they're discovering things themselves with Claude as a helpful guide, not receiving a presentation.
