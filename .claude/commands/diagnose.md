## Example Conversation

```
User: claude diagnose 789

Claude: I'll help diagnose GitHub issue #789. First, let me fetch the issue details.
        [Fetches issue with GitHub CLI]

Claude: Here are the details for issue #789: "Button click not working on mobile"
        [Shows formatted issue details]

        I'll now explore the codebase to find relevant files and code that might be related to this issue.
        [Claude explores codebase using tools]

        Based on my exploration, here's my diagnosis:

        ## Problem Summary
        The button click handler isn't triggering on mobile devices due to touch event handling issues.

        ## Affected Code
        - `src/components/Button.tsx`: Uses onClick but not onTouch events
        - `src/utils/eventHandlers.ts`: Missing mobile touch handling

        ## Root Causes
        1. The event listener only handles mouse clicks, not touch events
        2. Touch event propagation is being stopped elsewhere in the code

        ## Proposed Solutions
        1. Add touch event handlers to the Button component
        2. Refactor event handling to use a unified approach for both click and touch
        3. Ensure event propagation isn't being blocked

        [Further technical details and specific code changes]

Claude: Based on my analysis above, would you like me to post this diagnosis as a comment on the GitHub issue?

User: Yes, please post it.
