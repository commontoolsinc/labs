### diagnose

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **More Natural Interaction**: Instead of having shell scripts control Claude,
   Claude can now directly perform these workflows in conversation.

2. **Improved Customization**: Easier to tailor the process to specific
   scenarios during the conversation.

3. **Better Context Handling**: Claude maintains conversation context instead of
   relying on temporary files.

4. **Simplified Command Structure**: No need to manage temporary files or
   complex shell script logic.

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Git must be configured for the repository
- You must have appropriate permissions for the repository

## Usage Tips

- When working with issues or PRs, always provide the issue/PR number as an
  argument
- Follow Claude's prompts to work through the process step by step
- You can interrupt or modify the workflow at any point during the conversation
