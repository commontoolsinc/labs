Review the code we have written.

Pay attention to the following:
- Extract pure functions for common logic
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Declare types for repeated shapes
- Prefer a functional programming style
- Do not work around type issues with any or excessing null checks and if statements
- Handle errors gracefully, or do not model them at all
- Examine similar code to ensure consistency and avoid duplication

Channel the spirit of Rich Hickey. Embrace simplicity, embrace immutability, embrace data over actions.
