# Access Control Lists (ACL) Implementation for CT Spaces

## Current State

### Architecture Overview

The system currently uses UCAN (User Controlled Authorization Networks) for authorization as outlined in:
- [CT-378: RFC for user accounts architecture](https://linear.app/common-tools/issue/CT-378/rfc-describing-architecture-for-user-accounts)
- [GitHub RFC PR #4](https://github.com/commontoolsinc/RFC/pull/4/files)
- [Memory protocol RFC](https://github.com/commontoolsinc/RFC/blob/main/rfc/memory.md)

### Key Components

#### 1. Authorization System (`packages/memory/access.ts`)
- Memory service receives signed UCAN invocations at the endpoint
- Performs authorization verification through the `claim` function
- If all checks pass, the handler for the invocation is executed
- Otherwise, an authorization error is produced
- **Current limitation**: Assumes invocation issuer and audience are the same DID

#### 2. Client-Side Invocation (`packages/memory/consumer.ts`)
- Takes a keypair (signer) to sign all invocations
- Not fully UCAN spec compliant
- **Simplification**: Assumes invocation issuer and audience are the same.
- Needs to be updated to pass delegation chains with invocations

#### 3. Session Management (`packages/identity/src/session.ts`)
- Uses a single key from which signer per space is derived
- `createSession` function derives space-specific identities
- **Hack for backwards compatibility**: Enables public spaces

#### 4. Runtime Identity Handling (`packages/shell/src/lib/runtime.ts`)
- `createSession` function decides between:
  - `ANYONE` identity for public spaces
  - Specific account identity for private spaces
- Decision based on space name (spaces starting with "~" are private)

### Current Limitations

1. **Single Key Assumption**: Everything is derived from root account key
2. **No Cross-User Access**: Can't delegate access between different accounts
3. **No Authorization Store**: No way to persist and discover UCANs
4. **No Space Metadata**: Can't distinguish between private/shared spaces without extending the naming convention.
  - In case of shared spaces space name alone is not sufficient for resolving DID of the space.
5. **No Key Recovery**: If root key is lost/compromised, no recovery mechanism
6. **No Key Rotation**: Can't change keys without losing access

## Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Space Sharing**
   - Users can share access to spaces with collaborators (identified by DID)
   - Support for readonly and readwrite access levels
   - UCAN delegations stored in the space itself using `application/ucan+json` mime type

2. **Delegation Discovery**
   - Implement `access/claim` capability
   - Allow accounts to query all delegations made to them
   - Store delegations in both source and target spaces for discoverability

3. **Account Recovery**
   - Avoid dependency on root account key
   - Enable key rotation
   - Consider recovery options:
     - Delegation to user email
     - Delegation to company for assisted recovery

4. **Authorization Store**
   - Persistent storage for UCANs across sessions
   - Personal space for accounts to store delegations
   - Support for shared spaces that are not public

5. **Space Identification**
   - Carry space DID information alongside names
   - Future: Address book (petname system) for name-to-DID resolution

### Implementation Constraints

- Incremental rollout without full UCAN spec implementation
- Use subset of UCAN features initially
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing public spaces

## Decision Trees

### 1. Space Access Decision Tree

```
User attempts to access space
├─ Is space public (ANYONE identity)?
│  └─ Yes → Grant access
│  └─ No → Continue
├─ Is user the space owner?
│  └─ Yes → Grant full access
│  └─ No → Continue
├─ Does user have valid delegation?
│  ├─ Check authorization store
│  ├─ Validate delegation chain
│  └─ Yes → Grant delegated access
│  └─ No → Deny access
```

### 2. Implementation Rollout Decision Tree

```
Start Implementation
├─ Are prerequisites complete?
│  └─ No → Complete Phase 1 tasks
│  └─ Yes → Continue
├─ Is backwards compatibility maintained?
│  └─ No → Add compatibility layer
│  └─ Yes → Continue
├─ Deploy Phase 2 (Core ACL)
│  ├─ Test with internal users
│  ├─ Gather feedback
│  └─ Fix issues
├─ Deploy Phase 3 (Recovery)
│  ├─ Security audit
│  └─ Gradual rollout
└─ Deploy Phase 4 (Polish)
```

### 3. Recovery Method Decision Tree

```
Choose Recovery Method
├─ Email-based recovery?
│  ├─ Pros: User-controlled, familiar
│  ├─ Cons: Email security dependency
│  └─ Implementation: OAuth flow
├─ Company-assisted recovery?
│  ├─ Pros: High security, support available
│  ├─ Cons: Centralization, availability
│  └─ Implementation: Multi-sig approach
└─ Hybrid approach?
   ├─ Primary: Email recovery
   └─ Fallback: Company assistance
```

## Open Questions

1. **UCAN Spec Compliance**: Which parts of the UCAN spec should we implement first?
2. **Migration Strategy**: How do we migrate existing spaces to the new system?
3. **Performance**: How do we efficiently validate delegation chains?
4. **UI/UX**: How do users discover and manage shared spaces?
5. **Audit Trail**: Should we log all access attempts and delegation changes?
6. **Account Abstraction**: How should Account integrate with existing Identity/Session management?
7. **Space Abstraction**: Should Space be a wrapper around existing MemorySpace or a replacement?
8. **Delegation Constraints**: What types of constraints should Space.authorize() support (time, usage limits, etc.)?

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. **Review staging plan** with team and get alignment on Stage 1 scope
2. **Start S1.1** - Begin UCAN validation library implementation
3. **Design Space/Account abstractions** - Define interfaces for S1.2 and S1.3
4. **Plan routing changes** - Decide on URL structure for S1.4

### Stage 1 Sprint Planning
1. **Create test cases** for delegation chain validation (can be done before system integration)
2. **Define capability schema** - What capabilities do we support initially?
3. **Design import UX** - How do users receive and import delegation tokens?
4. **Migration strategy** - How do existing spaces get DIDs added to URLs?

### Stage 2 Preparation
1. **Storage schema design** - How are delegations stored as `application/ucan+json`?
2. **Performance planning** - Indexing strategy for delegation discovery
3. **Conflict resolution** - What happens when multiple delegations exist?

### Long-term Planning
1. **Security review** - External audit of delegation chain validation
2. **Performance testing** - Load testing with many delegations
3. **Recovery strategy finalization** - Email vs company-assisted vs hybrid approach
