# Agent Harness Runtime Contract

Status: draft 0.1

This document specifies the caller-visible behavior of a Common Fabric agent
harness. The contract is transport-neutral: a batch CLI, long-lived stdio
service, or another protocol may conform if it preserves the same lifecycle,
authority, containment, and evidence semantics.

## 1. Roles and trust boundaries

- The **caller** selects the task, prompt-slot roles, capabilities, mounts,
  policy profile, and resource bounds.
- The **harness** runs the model/tool loop and records authoritative run
  lifecycle evidence. It does not invent authority on the model's behalf.
- The **model gateway** produces model messages and tool requests. Its output is
  untrusted proposal data unless another trusted component supplies evidence to
  the contrary.
- The **execution substrate** executes tools inside the configured containment
  boundary.
- A **mediator** supplies trusted observation or policy evidence. It may be the
  execution substrate, the Common Fabric runner, or another declared trusted
  component.
- An **integration adapter** maps a product's concepts onto the harness
  contract. Adapter routing and product policy are not implicit harness powers.

An implementation profile MUST name which components occupy these roles and
which boundaries are trusted.

## 2. Invocation contract

**AH-INV-1.** Every run MUST have a stable run identifier and a run-start
configuration snapshot.

**AH-INV-2.** The snapshot MUST identify the selected model and provider
adapter, provider-affecting controls, credential-owner and authentication-source
binding, workspace and initial working directory, enabled tools and child
profiles, resource bounds, policy profile, prompt slots, and caller-supplied
mounts. Secret values MAY be represented by opaque references or digests rather
than copied into artifacts.

**AH-INV-3.** Prompt inputs MUST retain their declared roles. At minimum an
implementation MUST distinguish direct commands from context and quoted or
retrieved material. Text that sounds command-like MUST NOT acquire a stronger
role merely because of its content.

**AH-INV-4.** Invalid configuration, unavailable required capabilities, or paths
outside declared boundaries MUST fail before the first model request.

**AH-INV-5.** A provider failure MUST NOT silently move a run to a different
credential, billing, retention, or data-processing route. Any allowed fallback
MUST be explicit in the run snapshot and preserve the caller's authority and
disclosure constraints.

## 3. Capability negotiation

**AH-CAP-1.** A harness MUST expose a machine-readable capability description
without starting a model run.

**AH-CAP-2.** The description MUST distinguish parent tools, child profiles,
native model tools, repeatable configuration fields, and optional protocol
features. A caller MUST NOT infer capability from a binary's presence alone.

**AH-CAP-3.** Integrations SHOULD gate optional arguments and workflows from the
capability description so that version skew fails explicitly or degrades through
a documented path.

**AH-CAP-4.** Advertised capability means the harness understands and can
validate the feature. It does not by itself prove that an external dependency,
such as a sandbox daemon or browser lease, is healthy. Required dependency
health MUST be checked before accepting a run that needs it.

## 4. Run and turn lifecycle

**AH-LIFE-1.** A run moves from created to running and then to exactly one
terminal state: completed, failed, or cancelled.

**AH-LIFE-2.** The harness MUST durably record the terminal state and the last
accepted event before reporting terminal completion to the caller.

**AH-LIFE-3.** Cancellation MUST stop further model and tool work. An
implementation that launches child processes MUST reap or terminalize the owned
process tree; returning while owned executors continue side effects is
non-conforming.

**AH-LIFE-4.** Resource limits such as model turns, child turns, wall time, and
output size MUST be caller-visible and terminal failures MUST identify the limit
that was reached.

**AH-LIFE-5.** Automatic retries MUST be bounded, visible in run evidence, and
limited to operations whose replay semantics are declared safe.

The following clauses apply when context compaction, pruning, or another
provider continuation mechanism is advertised.

**AH-LIFE-6.** Context replacement MUST be represented in ordered run evidence.
It MUST preserve the active instructions, prompt-role distinctions, authority
evidence, and valid tool-call/tool-result relationships required by the selected
provider protocol.

**AH-LIFE-7.** The activation threshold, disabled state, and provider/model
compatibility of context replacement MUST be caller-visible. Discovery or
compaction failure MUST remain eligible for a later safe attempt or fail
explicitly; it MUST NOT permanently disable a required context guard through a
transient cached failure.

## 5. Tools and side effects

**AH-TOOL-1.** The parent tool surface MUST be derived from an explicit
allowlist or an implementation-profile default published in the conformance
statement.

**AH-TOOL-2.** A skill, retrieved document, model message, or child result MUST
NOT expand the allowed tool surface.

**AH-TOOL-3.** Every tool call MUST record the tool identity, bounded input
summary, outcome, timing, and policy/mediation disposition. Sensitive raw inputs
MAY be retained only inside the declared artifact boundary.

**AH-TOOL-4.** A side-effecting tool call MUST be attributable to an authorized
prompt slot or another explicit authority grant. Model intent alone is not an
authority grant.

**AH-TOOL-5.** Recoverable tool failures MUST return typed failure information
rather than masquerading as successful observations.

**AH-TOOL-6.** A harness MUST distinguish model-correctable tool failures from
failures in tool setup, containment, mediation, persistence, or harness
invariants. Only the former MAY be returned to the model as recoverable tool
outcomes. The latter MUST fail the run and keep operator-only diagnostic detail
out of the model-facing channel.

**AH-TOOL-7.** A tool that executes in a trusted host or external runtime MUST
be advertised separately from sandbox execution. Its configuration snapshot
MUST identify the bounded authority it uses, and its credentials MUST NOT enter
the model context or an untrusted execution substrate.

**AH-TOOL-8.** Before such a tool creates an external side effect, referenced
inputs MUST be resolved and authorized against the tool's configured authority.
A cross-authority or schema-incompatible reference MUST fail before the side
effect is created.

**AH-TOOL-9.** A tool that creates a durable external resource MUST publish its
cancellation, cleanup, enumeration, and retention semantics. The terminal run
evidence MUST retain enough provenance to find resources that ordinary product
listing surfaces do not enumerate.

**AH-TOOL-10.** Raw tool results MAY contain operator-only identifiers and
diagnostics, but every model-facing success and failure channel MUST apply the
declared sanitization and opaque-reference boundary before exposure.

## 6. Filesystem, host, and network containment

**AH-CONT-1.** The harness MUST resolve filesystem operations against an
explicit workspace or mount table and reject traversal through paths or symlinks
outside it.

**AH-CONT-2.** Read-only and writable mounts MUST remain distinguishable in the
run snapshot and enforcement path.

**AH-CONT-3.** Host execution MUST be a named capability with a narrower policy
than general sandbox execution. It MUST NOT appear in the parent surface merely
because a child profile uses it.

**AH-CONT-4.** Network posture MUST be explicit per profile. A caller MUST be
able to distinguish disabled, destination-constrained, and general network
access.

**AH-CONT-5.** Raw operator artifacts SHOULD be outside ordinary model-readable
workspace mounts. When they are not, artifact paths MUST be reserved from model
file and discovery tools.

**AH-CONT-6.** Each executor's working directory MUST resolve inside its own
mount table. A child MUST NOT inherit a parent working directory that is absent
from, or broader than, the child's authority; the harness MUST select an
explicit profile root instead.

## 7. Delegation

These clauses apply when delegation is advertised.

**AH-DEL-1.** A child run MUST begin with a fresh model context and an explicit
profile. Parent context, skills, tools, mounts, and credentials MUST NOT
transfer implicitly.

**AH-DEL-2.** A child profile MUST publish its tools, host powers, network
posture, skills, resource limits, and return policy.

**AH-DEL-3.** Raw child transcripts, tool outputs, and failure detail MUST
remain inside the child artifact boundary unless a declared release step
authorizes them for the parent.

**AH-DEL-4.** The ordinary parent return channel MUST be bounded and sanitized.
If a structured return schema is supplied, the harness MUST validate it before
exposure to the parent and fail closed on invalid values.

**AH-DEL-5.** The parent run MUST retain references to child identity, profile,
terminal state, and operator-visible artifacts.

## 8. Interactive sessions

These clauses apply when interactive sessions are advertised.

**AH-INT-1.** Sessions, turns, requests, responses, and events MUST have stable
identifiers sufficient for idempotent correlation and replay.

**AH-INT-2.** A session MUST define whether turns are serial or concurrent and
MUST reject unsupported overlap rather than silently interleave model context.

**AH-INT-3.** Event replay MUST have an explicit cursor or sequence contract.
Bounded in-memory retention MUST NOT erase events promised as durable.

**AH-INT-4.** Restoring a session MUST validate its workspace, policy, model,
mounts, and other authority-bearing configuration. A caller MUST NOT attach a
persisted session to a different authority context by changing metadata alone.

**AH-INT-5.** Turn cancellation and session closure MUST follow the terminality
and child-reaping requirements in section 4.

## 9. Model-bound references and immutable observations

The reference clauses apply when a harness advertises opaque handles for
structured resources. The observation clauses apply when file or binary
content is placed in model context.

**AH-REF-1.** The harness MUST mint handles only for positively identified,
structured referents. It MUST NOT infer a capability from an ambiguous bare
identifier or arbitrary free-form text.

**AH-REF-2.** A model-authored handle MUST resolve only when the current run's
table holds it. Resolution MUST occur before policy evaluation and dispatch.
Unknown, malformed, child-originated, or otherwise unheld tokens MUST remain
inert and MUST NOT become authority through their spelling alone.

**AH-REF-3.** A handle MUST remain stable for the same referent within its
declared lifetime, including supported resume paths. Handle tables and canonical
referents are sensitive run state. They MUST NOT transfer to another run or
child implicitly.

**AH-REF-4.** Substitution MUST preserve raw operator evidence while preventing
canonical identifiers from leaking through any model-facing success, denial,
or recoverable-error channel. A handle is an opaque presentation token, not an
authority grant or release decision.

**AH-OBS-1.** The byte identity of content exposed to the model MUST remain
stable for the observation's lifetime. An implementation MAY create an
immutable snapshot or integrity-lock the source, but a later source mutation,
deletion, or replacement MUST NOT silently change an earlier observation.

**AH-OBS-2.** Attachment media types and sizes MUST be bounded before model
exposure. Retained snapshots MUST be confined to the declared artifact boundary
and protected by the same integrity and model-disclosure rules as the
observation they preserve.

## 10. Artifacts and resume

**AH-ART-1.** A run MUST retain a configuration/capability snapshot, ordered
transcript or event log, terminal run state, policy events, and references to
tool and child outputs.

**AH-ART-2.** Artifact writes that represent accepted lifecycle state MUST be
atomic with respect to readers. A crash MUST produce either the prior complete
state or the next complete state, not a silently accepted partial document.

**AH-ART-3.** Artifact paths and run identifiers MUST be confined beneath the
declared artifact root.

**AH-ART-4.** Resume MUST preserve the original authority-bearing run
configuration. Any allowed override MUST be explicit, recorded, and unable to
silently broaden tools, mounts, policy, prompt authority, provider route,
credential owner, or authentication source.

**AH-ART-5.** Resume MUST detect incompatible or missing state and fail closed
rather than synthesizing a plausible transcript.

## 11. Model usage and cost evidence

These clauses apply when the selected provider reports usage or the harness
publishes usage or cost metadata.

**AH-USAGE-1.** Usage evidence MUST preserve which counters the provider
reported for each model attempt and MUST associate them with the selected model,
provider adapter, and attempt identity. An absent counter MUST remain absent; a
harness MUST NOT silently replace it with zero.

**AH-USAGE-2.** Direct-run usage and usage inclusive of completed descendants
MUST remain distinguishable. Every aggregate MUST define its coverage and MUST
avoid counting descendant usage both through a parent total and again as a
separate entry.

**AH-USAGE-3.** Cache-read, cache-write, reasoning, input, and output counters
MUST retain the selected provider's documented semantics. In particular, a
harness MUST NOT assume that cache counters are additive to input tokens, or
subsets of input tokens, without a provider contract that says so.

**AH-USAGE-4.** Provider-reported monetary cost and harness-estimated cost MUST
be separate fields with explicit provenance. An estimate MUST identify its
currency and rate-card source or version and MUST NOT be described as an
invoice, provider-reported charge, or subscription-quota conversion.

**AH-USAGE-5.** An aggregate monetary cost MUST be omitted when any included
record lacks compatible cost evidence. The result SHOULD include a typed reason
that distinguishes incomplete coverage from unsupported pricing, missing
provider detail, and invalid counters.

**AH-USAGE-6.** Terminal run artifacts MUST retain the usage and cost evidence
exposed to the caller. A transport with a structured terminal result SHOULD
include the same aggregate or an unambiguous reference to it.

## 12. Diagnostics and disclosure

**AH-DIAG-1.** Operator diagnostics SHOULD identify the failing boundary—model
gateway, configuration, sandbox, mediator, tool, child, artifact store, or
integration—without exposing secrets to the model-facing channel.

**AH-DIAG-2.** Reduced-assurance operation MUST be explicit in both the run
snapshot and terminal report. A warning in a transient log is insufficient.

**AH-DIAG-3.** Implementation profiles MUST list known deviations, provisional
host or network paths, and product adapters that deliberately select a weaker
profile.

**AH-DIAG-4.** If a harness attaches attribution metadata to provider requests,
the field set and coverage MUST be published. Values MUST be bounded and MUST
NOT include prompt text, tool arguments or results, personal identifiers, or
secrets. Inferred and caller-supplied attribution MUST remain distinguishable in
operator documentation.
