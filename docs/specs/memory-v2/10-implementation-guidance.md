# Implementation Guidance: Seq Revisions and Session Watch Sync

This document supplements sections 01-06 of the Memory v2 spec. It describes the
intended implementation target for the current rewrite, not the earlier
hash/fact/subscription prototype.

If this file conflicts with sections 01-06, update the file. Do not preserve
older guidance by layering compatibility code around it.

## Status Note

This guidance tracks the current implementation, not the full future protocol
target. In particular:

- the current wire protocol uses memory-v2 JSON envelopes encoded at the
  boundary with the shared flag-dispatched value codec, not UCAN-framed
  transport
- plain `transact` requests do not currently carry or persist per-commit
  `invocation` / `authorization` payloads; signed-write metadata remains
  deferred to a later pass
- the toolshed v2 websocket currently authenticates `session.open` by
  verifying a signature from the requested space DID against the requested
  session descriptor
- broader ACL / `Origin` enforcement, including non-owner read opens, remains
  deferred; treat the current endpoint as trusted-only for now
- session resume still uses caller-provided `sessionId` values; principal
  binding and server-issued session ids remain deferred
- one-shot `graph.query` now honors `branch` and `atSeq`
- the public one-shot read surface in this pass is `graph.query`; the older
  simple `query` / wildcard selector shape remains future protocol design
- watch installation remains current-state only in this pass; do not treat
  watch specs as historical subscriptions keyed by `atSeq`
- steady-state topology shrink does not yet drive automatic unwatch/removal
  semantics; clients should only rely on `removes` from explicit watch-set
  replacement in this pass
- branch lifecycle commands are not yet exposed on the v2 wire; current branch
  creation keeps its fork-seq semantics until that cutover lands

## 1. Source Of Truth

Implementation authority is:

1. sections 01-06 of this spec
2. this guidance file
3. the focused v2 tests
4. the current runtime-facing public interfaces

Do not revive old `commit.hash`, `fact.hash`, `value_ref`,
`graph.query subscribe`, or subscription-id routing because they existed in the
previous implementation.

## 2. Clean Break Rules

- Use a new engine root: `engine-v3` / `.engine-v3`.
- Do not migrate or read the current v2 SQLite files in place.
- Do not keep the old live wire protocol alongside the new one.
- Keep blob payload storage content-addressed; drop semantic hashes only from
  the JSON entity path.

## 3. Transport Target

This pass keeps the lightweight WebSocket framing already used by the current
codebase. The target wire messages are:

- `hello`
- `hello.ok`
- `session.open`
- `transact`
- `graph.query`
- `session.watch.set`
- `session.watch.add`
- `session.ack`
- `response`
- `session/effect`

Do not switch this pass to full UCAN message framing. None of the current wire
messages are transport-level signed UCAN invocations beyond the current
`session.open` authentication step.

## 4. Session Model

Use a logical session per space. The session owns:

- `sessionId`
- `seenSeq`
- retained outstanding commits keyed by `localSeq`
- the current watch set
- the current watch-union result known to the server

Reconnect behavior:

1. re-open the session with `sessionId` and `seenSeq`
2. replay outstanding commits in `localSeq` order
3. if `session.open` resumes an existing session, integrate its inline
   catch-up sync and keep the existing watch set
4. if `session.open` opens a fresh session, reinstall the watch set

The client should treat `seenSeq` as “highest canonical seq fully integrated
into confirmed state,” not merely “latest seq observed on the wire.”

Current deferred constraint:

- `sessionId` hardening is out of scope for this pass. Resume remains keyed by
  the supplied `(space, sessionId)` pair rather than a server-issued,
  principal-bound identifier.

The normal growth path for live interests should use `session.watch.add`,
including the first watch install on a fresh session. Use `session.watch.set`
only when replacing the full interest set. Watch mutations must be serialized
per session so overlapping add/set requests cannot race to construct competing
local watch views.

When `session.watch.add` receives a watch id that already exists, treat the
request as idempotent only if the watch definition is identical. If the
definition differs, reject the request and require the client to use
`session.watch.set` to replace the full watch set.

## 5. Transaction Contract

The runner-facing transaction contract does not change.

`IExtendedStorageTransaction.commit()` still has two phases:

1. synchronous local apply
2. asynchronous server resolution

The storage-visible notification behavior must remain:

- optimistic `"commit"` before the async round trip completes
- `"revert"` synchronously before the promise resolves on conflict
- `"integrate"` for remote sync

Path and document-boundary rules:

- `read()` / `write()` operate on full stored documents.
- `readValue()` / `writeValue()` style helpers are thin adapters that prepend
  `"value"` and then delegate to those full-document operations.
- the replica/storage layer should traffic in logical `EntityDocument` values,
  not a runner-side `StorageValue` interpretation.
- only the shared query/traversal layer treats selector paths as value-relative.
- `encodeMemoryV2Boundary` / `decodeMemoryV2Boundary` belong at persistence or
  wire boundaries, not in the middle of transaction or replica logic.

## 6. Stable Snapshot Rule

A transaction must be authored against one stable local snapshot.

- Do not apply incoming sync frames to confirmed state in the middle of building
  a transaction.
- Buffer incoming sync while a transaction is reading and writing.
- Apply buffered sync after the transaction has been submitted.

This rule is required so `reads.confirmed` and `reads.pending` describe one
coherent snapshot.

## 7. Commit Identity and Storage Identity

Use these identities consistently:

- pending commit identity: `(sessionId, localSeq)`
- canonical commit identity: `seq`
- persisted revision identity: `(branch, id, seq, opIndex)`

`seq` identifies the accepted transaction. `opIndex` identifies the specific
stored revision row when one commit writes multiple operations.

## 8. Engine Schema

Use a seq/revision schema, not a hash/fact schema.

Required persistent concepts:

- `commit`
- `revision`
- `head`
- `snapshot`
- `branch`
- `invocation`
- `authorization`
- `blob_store`

Required properties:

- `commit` has no semantic hash column
- `revision.data` stores inline encoded document payloads or patch arrays
- `head` points at `(seq, op_index)` for the current entity state
- `snapshot.value` stores inline full encoded document values
- `(session_id, local_seq)` remains unique for idempotent replay

## 9. Read Path

Current and point-in-time reads should use:

- direct head lookup for the latest state
- latest snapshot at or before the requested seq
- revision replay from that snapshot boundary

Do not rebuild JSON entity history through parent hashes.

Patch replay rules stay conservative:

- `set` and `delete` replace the current base state
- `patch` replays on top of the latest base/snapshot
- confirmed-read conflicts remain path-aware

## 10. Watch Sets And Sync

The server should not route live updates through the original watch request id.

Instead:

- each session owns the full current watch set
- the server computes the union of watched entities for that session
- the server emits `session/effect` sync frames for the union

Practical guidance:

- watch overlap should dedupe at the session cache layer
- `removes` mean “no longer relevant to this watch union,” not tombstone
- keep one-shot `graph.query` for non-live reads and shared traversal logic
- compare sync cache entries by revision identity (`branch`, `id`, `seq`,
  `deleted`), not by serializing document payloads on hot paths
- keep the client watch view incrementally ordered instead of rebuilding and
  sorting the full entity set on every emit

Before returning a `ConflictError`, flush any already-committed relevant sync so
the client can retry on fresh watched state.

## 11. Query / Traversal Reuse

Keep using the shared traversal code from `packages/runner/src/traverse.ts`.

The server and client must continue to agree on entity reachability and graph
membership. Reuse traversal logic rather than reimplementing a separate graph
expander in storage code.

For schema-aware live watches, keep the cache lifetimes split:

- keep a persistent doc-plus-selector tracker per watched graph so `watchAdd`
  can stop immediately at already-current frontiers
- allow additive watch growth to reuse a persistent traversal memo for the
  tracked graph
- use a fresh traversal memo for write-triggered refreshes so retargets and
  other topology changes cannot be incorrectly pruned by stale memo entries

For one-shot reads, `graph.query` must honor:

- `branch` for branch-scoped traversal
- `atSeq` for point-in-time reconstruction on that branch

Do not silently drop `atSeq` from one-shot query semantics.

Keep shared JSON-pointer and path-overlap helpers in one module under
`packages/memory/v2` so patch application, conflict detection, and runner-side
read invalidation do not drift.

## 12. Branch Scope

This pass includes only the branch-aware read/write/query behavior already wired
through the core storage path:

- branch-aware writes
- branch-aware current reads
- branch-aware point-in-time reads
- branch-aware watch scopes

Public branch lifecycle commands, merge proposal generation, and advanced branch
live-sync behavior remain deferred. Do not block the seq/revision rewrite on
merge ergonomics.

## 13. Testing Strategy

Drive the rewrite with focused red/green TDD.

For each implementation slice:

1. write or update the focused failing test first
2. make the minimal production change needed to turn it green
3. clean up only after the test is passing

Do not batch large speculative rewrites and add tests afterward. If a behavior
matters enough to preserve or change, capture it in a failing test before
changing the implementation.

Required test areas:

- new engine-root path resolution
- rejection of unsafe store subjects before path construction
- revision replay and snapshots
- idempotent `(sessionId, localSeq)` replay
- session watch installation and catch-up sync
- duplicate-id handling for `session.watch.add`
- one-shot `graph.query` coverage for `branch` and `atSeq`
- reconnect with outstanding commits
- runner notification ordering
- toolshed end-to-end sync on the new protocol

Keep the runner/storage public surface stable in tests. If a test only probes
old v2 internals that are being deleted, rewrite or remove it instead of
restoring the deleted behavior.

## 14. Anti-Patterns

Do not:

- reintroduce hash-addressed JSON facts as an internal compatibility layer
- keep both subscription-id updates and session sync at once
- tie live updates to the invocation or request that created a watch
- compare confirmed duplicates by `(seq, hash)` after hashes are gone
- silently fall back from the new engine root to the old one
- spread branch support across special cases instead of carrying branch through
  the core read/write path
