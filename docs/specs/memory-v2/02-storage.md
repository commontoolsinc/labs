# 02 — Storage

This section defines the SQLite schema, indexing strategy, revision and snapshot
storage design, branch representation, point-in-time read algorithm, and
operational configuration.

The key storage change in this revision is that JSON entity history is no longer
content-addressed. Instead, committed JSON state is represented by:

- an append-only `commit` log keyed by canonical `seq`
- an append-only `revision` log keyed by `(branch, id, seq, op_index)`
- a `head` table for current branch-local pointers
- periodic `snapshot` rows storing full materialized entity documents

When present, invocation/auth blobs and raw binary blobs remain
content-addressed.

## 1. Database-per-Space

Each space gets its own dedicated SQLite database file:

```text
<storage_root>/<did>.sqlite
```

This keeps spaces isolated and lets WAL mode operate independently per space.

## 2. SQLite Pragmas

Every database connection applies the following pragmas:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;
PRAGMA cache_size = -64000;
PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;
PRAGMA mmap_size = 268435456;
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

For newly created databases:

```sql
PRAGMA page_size = 32768;
```

## 3. Tables

### 3.1 `revision` — Sequenced JSON History

Stores every entity mutation as an append-only revision row.

```sql
CREATE TABLE revision (
  branch      TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  id          TEXT    NOT NULL,
  seq         INTEGER NOT NULL,
  op_index    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  op          TEXT    NOT NULL,  -- 'set' | 'patch' | 'delete'
  data        JSON,              -- full document for set, patch list for patch, NULL for delete
  commit_seq  INTEGER NOT NULL,

  PRIMARY KEY (branch, id, seq, op_index),
  FOREIGN KEY (commit_seq) REFERENCES commit(seq)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_revision_branch_seq ON revision (branch, seq);
CREATE INDEX idx_revision_entity_seq ON revision (branch, id, seq);
CREATE INDEX idx_revision_commit ON revision (commit_seq);
```

Notes:

- `seq` is the global commit order for the space.
- `op_index` preserves operation order within one transaction.
- For `set`, `data` stores the full `EntityDocument`.
- For `patch`, `data` stores the serialized patch list.
- For `delete`, `data` is `NULL`.
- The storage/transaction layer operates on full-document paths. Only the
  query/traversal layer treats selector paths as value-relative and re-roots
  them through `["value", ...path]`.
- `data`, `original`, `resolution`, `invocation`, `authorization`, and
  `snapshot.value` are serialized at the persistence boundary with the shared
  rich-value JSON codec, not with ad hoc `JSON.stringify` calls in the middle of
  replica/transaction logic.

### 3.2 `head` — Current State Pointer

Tracks the latest visible revision for each entity on each branch.

```sql
CREATE TABLE head (
  branch       TEXT    NOT NULL,
  id           TEXT    NOT NULL,
  seq          INTEGER NOT NULL,
  op_index     INTEGER NOT NULL,

  PRIMARY KEY (branch, id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_head_branch ON head (branch);
```

The `head` table is a pointer only. The full current value is reconstructed from
the nearest snapshot at or before `seq`, then by replaying later revisions.

At this layer the reconstructed value is the full stored document object, not a
special runner-side `StorageValue` projection.

### 3.3 `commit` — Sequenced Write Log

Records every successful write-class command.

```sql
CREATE TABLE commit (
  seq                INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  branch             TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  session_id         TEXT    NOT NULL,
  local_seq          INTEGER NOT NULL,
  invocation_ref     TEXT,
  authorization_ref  TEXT,
  original           JSON    NOT NULL,
  resolution         JSON    NOT NULL,
  created_at         TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),

  FOREIGN KEY (invocation_ref) REFERENCES invocation(ref),
  FOREIGN KEY (authorization_ref) REFERENCES authorization(ref)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_commit_branch ON commit (branch);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_commit_session_local_seq
  ON commit (session_id, local_seq);
CREATE INDEX idx_commit_invocation_ref ON commit (invocation_ref);
```

`original` stores the canonical semantic payload:

- `ClientCommit` for `/memory/transact`
- normalized branch lifecycle payloads for `/memory/branch/create` and
  `/memory/branch/delete`

`resolution` stores server-side decisions:

```json
{
  "seq": 42,
  "resolvedPendingReads": [
    { "localSeq": 4, "seq": 40 }
  ]
}
```

Current implementation note:

- plain `/memory/transact` commits leave `invocation_ref` /
  `authorization_ref` unset
- those columns are reserved for a later signed-write pass or for legacy rows
  carried forward from earlier builds

### 3.4 `snapshot` — Materialized Entity Values

Stores full materialized entity documents at selected seqs to avoid replaying
the full revision chain on every read.

```sql
CREATE TABLE snapshot (
  branch  TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  id      TEXT    NOT NULL,
  seq     INTEGER NOT NULL,
  value   JSON    NOT NULL,

  PRIMARY KEY (branch, id, seq)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_snapshot_lookup ON snapshot (branch, id, seq);
```

`value` contains the full `EntityDocument`, not just `value`.

### 3.5 `branch` — Branch Metadata

Tracks branch lifecycle and fork points.

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch (
  name           TEXT    NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  parent_branch  TEXT,
  fork_seq       INTEGER,
  created_seq    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  head_seq       INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at     TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  status         TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active'
);

CREATE INDEX idx_branch_status ON branch (status);
CREATE INDEX idx_branch_parent ON branch (parent_branch);
```

### 3.6 `invocation` — Reserved Persisted Invocation Payloads

Reserved for a future pass that persists signed write envelopes. Current plain
`/memory/transact` commits do not populate this table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE invocation (
  ref         TEXT    NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  iss         TEXT    NOT NULL,
  aud         TEXT,
  cmd         TEXT    NOT NULL,
  sub         TEXT    NOT NULL,
  invocation  JSON    NOT NULL,
  created_at  TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

CREATE INDEX idx_invocation_sub ON invocation (sub);
CREATE INDEX idx_invocation_cmd ON invocation (cmd);
CREATE INDEX idx_invocation_iss ON invocation (iss);
```

Current implementation note:

- existing rows may remain from earlier experimental builds
- treat any stored blob and extracted fields as untrusted audit data, not as
  verified authorization proof

### 3.7 `authorization` — Reserved Persisted Authorization Payloads

Reserved for a future pass that persists signed write envelopes. Current plain
`/memory/transact` commits do not populate this table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE authorization (
  ref            TEXT    NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  authorization  JSON    NOT NULL,
  created_at     TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

Current implementation note:

- the authorization blob is persisted verbatim from the current transport
  payload
- verification and binding to the websocket caller remain deferred in this pass
- treat persisted authorization JSON as untrusted audit data until verification
  lands

### 3.8 `blob_store` — Immutable Content-Addressed Binary Data

Stores raw immutable blob payloads.

```sql
CREATE TABLE blob_store (
  hash          TEXT    NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  data          BLOB    NOT NULL,
  content_type  TEXT,
  size          INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at    TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

### 3.9 `state` — Convenience View

The current visible state of a branch/entity is defined by `head`. A simple
helper view can expose current head pointers:

```sql
CREATE VIEW state AS
SELECT branch, id, seq, op_index
FROM head;
```

Materializing the actual JSON document still requires the read algorithm in
section 5.

## 4. Revision Storage

### 4.1 How Revisions Are Stored

Each accepted transaction produces:

1. one `commit` row
2. one or more `revision` rows
3. one `head` update per touched entity
4. optional `snapshot` refreshes

If a transaction contains:

```typescript
[
  { op: "set", id: "a", value: { value: { count: 1 } } },
  {
    op: "patch",
    id: "b",
    patches: [{ op: "replace", path: "/value/name", value: "x" }],
  },
];
```

then the server appends:

- `commit(seq = N, ...)`
- `revision(branch, "a", N, 0, "set", <document>)`
- `revision(branch, "b", N, 1, "patch", <patches>)`

### 4.2 Write Path

The write path for `/memory/transact` is:

```sql
BEGIN;

INSERT INTO commit (
  seq, branch, session_id, local_seq,
  invocation_ref, authorization_ref,
  original, resolution
)
VALUES (
  :seq, :branch, :session_id, :local_seq,
  NULL, NULL,
  :original_json, :resolution_json
);

INSERT INTO revision (branch, id, seq, op_index, op, data, commit_seq)
VALUES (:branch, :id, :seq, :op_index, :op, :data_json, :seq);

INSERT INTO head (branch, id, seq, op_index)
VALUES (:branch, :id, :seq, :op_index)
ON CONFLICT (branch, id)
DO UPDATE SET seq = excluded.seq, op_index = excluded.op_index;

COMMIT;
```

The same pattern applies to branch lifecycle writes, except those commands do
not append `revision` rows and instead update the `branch` table.

## 5. Read Path

### 5.1 Read Current Value

To read the current value of an entity on a branch:

1. look up `(seq, op_index)` in `head`
2. load the nearest `snapshot` on or before `seq`
3. replay later `revision` rows for that entity through `seq`

```sql
SELECT seq, op_index
FROM head
WHERE branch = :branch AND id = :id;
```

Nearest snapshot:

```sql
SELECT seq, value
FROM snapshot
WHERE branch = :branch
  AND id = :id
  AND seq <= :target_seq
ORDER BY seq DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Later revisions:

```sql
SELECT seq, op_index, op, data
FROM revision
WHERE branch = :branch
  AND id = :id
  AND seq > :base_seq
  AND seq <= :target_seq
ORDER BY seq ASC, op_index ASC;
```

Replay rules:

- `set`: replace the full document
- `patch`: apply the patch list to the current document
- `delete`: mark the entity deleted

### 5.2 Point-in-Time Read

Point-in-time reads use the same algorithm, but `target_seq` is provided by the
caller rather than coming from `head`.

If no snapshot exists, replay begins from the entity's implicit Empty state.

### 5.3 Read Multiple Entities

For batched reads, implementations SHOULD:

- fetch `head` or point-in-time targets in one query
- fetch snapshots in bulk
- fetch revisions grouped by entity
- reuse parsed JSON where possible

## 6. Snapshot Creation

### 6.1 Trigger Condition

The server SHOULD create or refresh snapshots:

- after a configurable number of revisions on one entity
- when patch replay depth exceeds a configured threshold
- opportunistically during background maintenance

### 6.2 Snapshot Materialization

To materialize a snapshot:

1. reconstruct the entity document at `target_seq`
2. upsert a `snapshot(branch, id, seq, value)` row

```sql
INSERT INTO snapshot (branch, id, seq, value)
VALUES (:branch, :id, :seq, :value_json)
ON CONFLICT (branch, id, seq) DO NOTHING;
```

### 6.3 Snapshot Compaction

The storage layer MAY retain only the newest snapshot per entity per branch, or
retain a short historical tail for faster point-in-time reads.

## 7. Garbage Collection

### 7.1 JSON Revision History

The revision log is append-only and forms the audit trail. Revisions are not
deleted during ordinary GC.

### 7.2 Old Snapshots

Snapshots older than the configured retention policy may be deleted.

```sql
DELETE FROM snapshot
WHERE (branch, id, seq) NOT IN (
  SELECT branch, id, MAX(seq)
  FROM snapshot
  GROUP BY branch, id
);
```

### 7.3 Session-Local Replay State

Ephemeral in-memory structures for pending-read resolution and session sync may
be pruned once every connected session has acknowledged a `seenSeq` newer than
the relevant entry.

### 7.4 Policy

- GC runs as a background task, never inside user commits
- default policy is retain-all for revisions
- snapshots and in-memory session state are the primary GC targets in phase 1

## 8. Branch Storage

### 8.1 Branch Representation

Branches share the same `revision` and `commit` logs but maintain separate head
pointers in `head`.

Branch creation appends a write-class `commit` row and inserts branch metadata:

```sql
INSERT INTO branch (name, parent_branch, fork_seq, created_seq, head_seq)
VALUES (:name, :parent_branch, :fork_seq, :created_seq, :created_seq);
```

### 8.2 Branch Writes

Writing to a branch is identical to writing to the default branch, except the
`branch` column on `commit`, `revision`, `head`, and `snapshot` rows is set to
that branch name.

### 8.3 Branch Seq Numbering

Seq is space-global across all branches. `created_seq` records when the branch
name came into existence. `head_seq` records the newest entity-state change
visible on that branch.

### 8.4 Branch Deletion

Branch deletion appends a write-class `commit` row and marks the branch as
deleted:

```sql
UPDATE branch
SET status = 'deleted'
WHERE name = :name;
```

Branch deletion does not remove shared revision history.

## 9. Point-in-Time Read Implementation

### 9.1 Algorithm

For entity `(branch, id)` at `target_seq`:

1. resolve the visible branch-local head at or before `target_seq`
2. locate the nearest snapshot at or before `target_seq`
3. replay later revisions up to `target_seq`
4. return the resulting document or tombstone

### 9.2 Branch-Aware PIT Reads

If an entity has no explicit head on a child branch, head resolution falls back
through the parent branch chain at the child's `fork_seq`.

## 10. Blob Store Operations

### 10.1 Write a Blob

```sql
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO blob_store (hash, data, content_type, size)
VALUES (:hash, :data, :content_type, :size);
```

### 10.2 Read a Blob

```sql
SELECT data, content_type, size
FROM blob_store
WHERE hash = :hash;
```

### 10.3 Blob Metadata

Blob metadata remains ordinary entity state under:

```text
urn:blob-meta:<blob_hash>
```

The blob payload is content-addressed. The metadata entity participates in the
normal seq-based JSON revision model.

## 11. Migration

This design is intentionally a clean break:

- the content-addressed JSON `value` table is removed
- the content-addressed JSON `fact` table is removed
- `commit.hash` is removed from the semantic JSON write path
- current JSON state is reconstructed from `snapshot + revision replay`

Because patches, snapshots, branches, resumable sessions, and session-scoped
catch-up sync all change meaning together, in-place migration from the older
hash-oriented schema is not a design goal for phase 1.
