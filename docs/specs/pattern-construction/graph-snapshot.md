# Process Snapshot Schema

> **Status:** This work is **deferred to Phase 2** (see `rollout-plan.md` and
> `overview.md`). The snapshot format described here will be implemented as part
> of the `process` metadata work mentioned in the rollout plan (lines 54-61).

## Motivation

- `Runner.setupInternal` currently stores pattern metadata inside the process
  cell (`TYPE`, `argument`, `internal`, `resultRef`). We plan to deprecate
  `TYPE` while still persisting the originating program reference. The runtime
  still lacks a persisted view of the concrete nodes it instantiated.
- `instantiateNode` performs alias gymnastics through
  `unwrapOneLevelAndBindtoDoc` so nested patterns and closures work. A snapshot
  that records the resolved nodes makes this machinery obsolete: future runs can
  reconstruct bindings directly from the snapshot.
- Persisting a snapshot on the result cell lets the runtime answer "what does
  this graph look like" without re-running the factory, simplifying rehydration
  and teardown.

## Relationship to Rollout Plan

This spec describes the implementation for tasks in `rollout-plan.md` lines
54-61:

- Write metadata into result cell including `source` (from context) and
  `process` metadata
- The `process` field contains the graph snapshot described in this document,
  including:
  - The `Module` (which includes the `Program` as link using `cid:hash`)
  - Created cells with links to module and/or schema
  - History of previously used schemas (P2 for safe updating)

## Snapshot Envelope

Store an additional `process` payload on the result cell alongside the existing
`value`, `source`, and renamed `pattern` metadata. The payload is versioned to
allow future format changes.

```ts
interface ProcessSnapshotV1 {
  version: 1;
  program?: RuntimeProgram;
  generation?: number; // Incremented each time it changes
  cells: Array<GeneratedCell>;
  predecessor?: ProcessSnapshotV1;
}

interface ReactiveNodeNarrowedSchema = {
  argumentSchema?: JSONSchema; // optional, further constraint on what
  resultSchema?: JSONSchema;   // the module already says
}

interface ReactiveNodeArgument = {
  arguments: JSONArray;
} & ReactiveNodeNarrowedSchema;

interface HandlerNodeNarrowedSchema = {
  eventSchema?: JSONSchema; // see above
  stateSchema?: JSONSchema;
  resultSchema?: JSONSchema;
}

interface HandlerNodeArgument = {
  stream: SigilLink; // Event stream
  state?: JSONArray; // Optional state
} & HandlerNodeNarrowedSchema

interface CurriedArguments = {
  curried?: { index?: number, value: JSONValue }[];
}

interface BoxedNodeFactory = { module: NodeFactoryDescriptor }

interface BoxedLink = { link: NormalizedLink } // relative to this cell

type GeneratedCell =
 | BoxedLink
 | (BoxedLink & BoxedNodeFactory &
    (ReactiveNodeArgument | HandlerNodeArgument) & CurriedArgument);

type NodeFactoryDescriptor =
  | ((
    | {
      type: "javascript";
      implementation: string;
    }
    | {
      type: "ref";
      ref: string;
    }) & (
    | {
      argumentSchema: JSONSchema;
      resultSchema: JSONSchema;
    }
    | {
      eventSchema: JSONSchema;
      stateSchema: JSONSchema;
      resultSchema?: JSONSchema;
    }))
  | {
    type: "program";
    program: RuntimeProgram; // Resolves to a node factory with schemas, etc.
  }
```

- Notes:

  - .
  - `CellLink` reuses the normalized link format the runtime already
    understands.
  - `Binding` supports nested structures so aliases into deeply nested inputs
    are preserved without separate link tables.
  - Optional `argumentSchema`/`resultSchema` on the node let nodes further
    constrain or specialize module signatures without mutating the module
    definition.
  - `program` points to the main compiled artifact so tooling can correlate
    modules with source files (see `packages/runner/src/harness/types.ts` for
    `RuntimeProgram`).
  - Descriptor-level `argumentSchema` values MUST describe array/prefix-array
    schemas so reactive nodes can express tuple-style inputs used by lifts and
    handlers.

## Generation Flow (Phase 2)

> **Note:** This describes future implementation work after Phase 1 type
> unification is complete.

1. When `Runner.startWithTx` iterates nodes during lift/handler execution,
   instrument each instantiation to record:
   - The resolved module descriptor, including implementation reference
   - Normalized input links (already resolved since cells have concrete causes
     from Phase 1 work)
   - Either an output link (for reactive nodes) or a stream link (for event
     handlers), whichever applies
   - Optional argument/result schemas attached by the builder
2. Compute the final snapshot object, attach it to
   `resultCell.withTx(tx).setMetadata("process", snapshot)` (note: using
   `process` not `graph` to match rollout plan), and persist it in the same
   transaction that finishes setup

## Rehydration Strategy (Phase 2)

> **Note:** Deferred to Phase 2 implementation.

- On `Runner.setupInternal`, if a prior snapshot exists, load it before
  unpacking defaults. The runtime can:
  - Reattach scheduler subscriptions by walking the nodes, reusing modules whose
    implementation reference matches
  - Rehydrate handler streams directly from their stored links
- When a handler or lift causes a graph to rebuild, diff the previous and new
  node lists. Nodes that disappear are torn down by following their stored
  output/stream links. Nodes with matching descriptors can reuse their existing
  cells

## Teardown and Diffing (Phase 2)

> **Note:** Deferred to Phase 2 implementation.

- Nodes uniquely define the dependencies; links are inferred from the cell links
  embedded inside each snapshot entry. Diffing node descriptors is sufficient to
  drive teardown
- Maintain a monotonic `generation` counter on the snapshot. When a handler
  triggers rehydration, increment the counter so logs can correlate actions with
  rebuilds

## Outstanding Questions

- Should snapshots include scheduler bookkeeping (e.g., dependency edges, last
  run timestamps) or should that remain derived at runtime?
- How do we store large schemas efficiently? Option: store a content hash in the
  snapshot and persist the full schema in a shared manifest keyed by hash.
