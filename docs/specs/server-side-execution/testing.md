# v2 detail: testing and measurement

Binding on every v2 phase. The plan's success criteria
([server-execution-v2.md](../../plans/server-execution-v2.md)) are
implemented as the gates below. Method inherited from the v1 learning run
(full record: archived orchestration log §2.4–§2.5).

## 1. Harness rules (non-negotiable)

- Integration runs go through `deno task integration --port-offset=NNN`
  — never a hand-rolled server (`MEMORY_URL` defaults to port 8000; a
  hand-rolled harness on a shared box writes into someone else's
  primary). The task wires both servers and storage correctly.
- **Workloads are uninstrumented and byte-identical across arms.** v1's
  own measurement probes warmed the measured path and understated its
  cost. Measurement reads counters and JUnit timings from outside.
- Arms run adjacent (same load window), ≥3 reps for any latency claim,
  no latency quoted above load ~5. Counters and set relations are
  load-insensitive and always quotable.
- Causation by ablation: a slowdown is "explained" when toggling the
  suspected mechanism moves the number, not when a narrative fits.
- Fresh store per measured run (`rm -rf packages/toolshed/cache` between
  arms); NOTE the store persists across `deno task integration`
  invocations — suite-scale tests (Phase 6) exploit this deliberately,
  latency tests must not inherit it accidentally.
- `deno task test` never RUNS the `.test.tsx` pattern lane or the
  integration lanes — the caveat is lane coverage, not exit codes. CI
  runs them all; so must local verification before any push.

## 2. CI arms

From the first PR with testable behavior: the integration suites run
twice — `EXPERIMENTAL_SERVER_EXECUTION` OFF (must be byte-identical
to today up to the recorded acceptances — key-vocabulary §5's, and
the verification-coverage register's recorded-acceptance rows (RULED
2026-08-05, widened for stage G's claim-guard delta the same day);
any other OFF-arm diff is a Phase-gate failure by
itself) and
ON. The ON arm is allowed to skip
not-yet-implemented phases via explicit skip lists per phase, never via
silent filtering. (v1's terminal failure mode: the flags-on branch never
went through CI at all.)

*Phase 7 FLIPPED (2026-08-28):
`SERVER_EXECUTION_DEFAULT_ENABLED = true`. CI names the two exercised
postures by stable role rather than by today's value:

- `default` leaves `EXPERIMENTAL_SERVER_EXECUTION` unset and follows the
  first-party constant. It is ON today.
- `opposite` explicitly selects the inverse and uses a toolshed whose browser
  shell has that same value baked in. It is OFF today.

`tasks/server-execution-ci.ts` is the single mapping from those roles to the
resolved value, label, record variant, runtime environment, baked shell define,
and posture probe. Changing the first-party default therefore swaps which role
is ON and which is OFF without rewriting workflow topology. Before each suite,
the probe checks `/api/meta.experimental.serverExecution`, the shell define,
and presence (ON) or absence (OFF) of `/api/health/stats.servingLoop`; a mixed
server/client/shell posture is never a valid arm exercise.

The ON-only skip registry in `tasks/server-execution-on-skips.ts` follows the
role that resolves ON, is printed loudly, and was EMPTY at the flip. The OFF
arm always runs every file. The two pattern step guards named in their source
files remain exceptions that read the raw environment only to decide whether a
registered step is skipped; their runtimes still adopt the lane toolshed's
published posture. Authored-pattern coverage follows the role that resolves
OFF, while the default role retains V8 coverage. The default role's test-record
identity remains unmarked; the opposite role gets the variant for its actual
posture (`server-execution` for ON or `server-execution-off` for OFF).

The deployed-topology gates follow `default`: the real
`bg-piece-service` binary and cf-harness fabric-session factory run against the
default toolshed, the CLI adopts and verifies the server's published posture,
and `PiecesController` hosts ride the default package/pattern lanes.
Single-process suites (the unit suites, `cf test`, and runner integration files
that serve toolshed's `app.ts` in-process) have no serving host and remain the
ambient derive-and-commit model (OFF) by construction.*

Test-record identity follows the [test-run record
contract](../test-records.md). The `default` role leaves the shipping action's
variant unset, continuing the existing unmarked history. The `opposite` role
uses the marker for the posture it actually exercises: `server-execution` when
ON, or `server-execution-off` when OFF. Today that means unmarked ON and marked
OFF. The pre-flip explicit-ON history stays queryable under
`server-execution`. Workflow tests assert both the dynamic opposite marker and
the unmarked default.

## 3. The watermark replaces polling

`waitForSettled(space, seq)` — new test helper: resolves when the
space's watermark ≥ seq (protocol.md §4). Integration tests MUST use it
instead of text-polling / `waitForCondition` loops for "server done"
(v1 tests burned 60 s barriers on exactly this). Text assertions remain
for *what* rendered; the watermark answers *when*.

## 4. Counter assertions

`/api/health/stats` → `servingLoop` block (serving-loop.md §7). Gate
tests assert counters, not logs:

- amplification, ONE metric: `derivedCommits / (authoredSeen −
  effectAcks) ≤ 2` on pure workloads (lunch-poll, the first ON-arm
  gate; v1 measured 60×) and `≤ 3` on workloads with effectful nodes
  (their completion commits are derived-class). A logical write is
  one authored commit excluding effect-channel acks. The budget is a
  TRIGGER, not a hard gate (owner, 2026-08-02): exceeding it fails
  the test UNTIL a human inspects the why — a breach is a question to
  answer, not only a number to fix. The inspection either fixes the
  amplification or re-baselines the budget with the reason recorded
  here; it is never silenced in the test.
- single-run: `waves == authored input batches` ballpark;
  `memo.hits/misses` sane on restart tests.
- idempotency: `events.skippedIdempotent` == replayed-event count in the
  kill-restart test, and effect results unduplicated (store query).
- single-deriver envelope (Phase 2 gate; reworded for the
  transaction identity model — a `derived` commit's envelope carries
  no session, so there is no commit-level session to group by): a
  store query over `derived` commits shows every envelope principal
  == the lease-holding SpaceServer's service identity and NONE from
  a client session; equivalently, zero `derived`-class commits
  admitted from any client connection in the ON arm.

## 5. Phase gates → concrete tests

New tests live in `packages/patterns/integration/` with the prefix
`sx2-` (server execution v2), so the suite filter `sx2` runs the whole
v2 gate set. Existing product tests double as gates where noted.

**Ahead of every gate: the executable spec model**
(`packages/spec-model/server-execution/`) checks the identity/commit
machinery's schedule-dependent properties — inheritance, LT1
carriage, delegated stamping, split repetition, watermark
idempotency, push filtering, the enact/ack window — by exhaustive
small-configuration interleaving with fault injection, unattended
(`deno task test`). It re-verifies each ruling batch mechanically,
carried the FP1 characterization until its 2026-08-03 ruling and
now asserts CLOSURE (durable append rows — no schedule loses an
append), and is the seed the `sx2-` conformance tests grow
from: a stage's semantics get modeled before its implementation
exists, then the properties become the implementation's oracle.

| phase | gate tests |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | stages A–G land dark: OFF arm byte-identical per stage (§2), stage E's instance re-keying included (OFF-arm neutral by construction); ON arm runs in CI with explicit skip lists (no ON gates — the first ON milestone is Phase 2's) |
| 2 | `sx2-serving-loop` (counters, amplification, restart-memo) and `sx2-speculation` (echo latency, overlay retirement; the client-side overlay diagnostic witnesses "commits nothing for derivations" — the zero-client-derived STORE-ATTRIBUTION query needs engine access and is pinned, both halves, in `packages/runner/test/speculation-overlay.test.ts`, not duplicated into the browser gate); existing `counter`, `cfc-group-chat-demo-multi-runtime` in ON arm; byte-identical suite both arms |
| 3 | `sx2-events` (two-user lunch poll via server handlers; kill-between-event-and-consequence restart; duplicate-submit rejection; rapid-fire final-only values with every event processed); rapid-fire COALESCING is discriminated by the CONSTRUCTED-queue-depth pin in the runner suite (`executor-events-down.test.ts`: K entries queued ahead of one drain → K completed runs, each consequenced exactly once, in EXACTLY ONE consequence-carrying derived commit) — the live surface LOGS its derived-commit ratio as a load observation, never a gate, because its append queue serializes one commit round trip per event and the ratio has no test lever (RULED 2026-08-21 — owner: “i like (3) as well”, on the ow-sx2-coalescing-gate dispositions; the census flake this retires was the ratio assert reading a fast drain as a failure); propagation ≤300 ms p50 measured on `lunch-poll-vote` UNMODIFIED |
| 4 | `sx2-effect-channel` (navigate intent/ack; reload between intent and ack; optimistic-enact reconcile); existing `topics-navigation` ON — ON-SKIP-LISTED since Phase 4 (red under the full ON posture: OW30's controller write-destination class; not ON coverage until it lifts) |
| 5 | existing `shared-profile`, `profile-embed`, `sqlite-read-clearance-multi-runtime` green ON — the v1 stragglers are the acceptance tests |
| 6 | `sx2-scale` (cf-checkbox in-suite ≈ isolated; budget: hostile LLM fan-out in space A leaves space B's propagation in budget); no poll-loops left in the suite |
| 7 | full suites ON-only; propagation beats OFF-arm baseline on byte-identical workloads — NEITHER met at the flip-ready landing (2026-08-16): the ON lanes are green only with six `phase-7` skip entries (verification-coverage OW30/OW32/OW33) and the benchmark is unmeasured (its harness is the two-browsers gate, red on OW32) |

## 6. The two standing baselines

Recorded 2026-08-02 (quiet box), the numbers v2 is measured against:

- Cross-user propagation, client-computed (today): 92–294 ms.
- Actor-side interactive latency (today): ~318 ms.
- Amplification (today): ~15× commits per logical write on lunch-poll
  (150 commits / ~10 writes — deploys and bootstrap included); v2's
  budget (≤2 pure / ≤3 effectful, §4's single metric, logical write =
  one authored commit excluding effect-channel acks) is for the
  steady-state interaction window, measured between first and last
  user action.
