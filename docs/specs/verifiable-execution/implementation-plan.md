# CT Protocol Implementation Plan

This document tracks implementation status of the CT Protocol specification.
See `docs/specs/verifiable-execution/README.md` for the spec index.

## Status Legend

- [x] Done
- [ ] Not started
- [~] Partial / in progress

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Mostly Complete)

### 1.1 Append-Only Log

- [x] SQLite-based fact storage (`packages/memory/space.ts`)
- [x] Content-addressed facts via `merkle-reference`
- [x] Causal chains via `cause` field linking facts
- [x] Lamport clock sequencing (`since` field)
- [x] Fact table with `{this, the, of, is, cause, since}` schema
- [ ] Merkle inclusion proofs for log entries
- [ ] Log root computation (MMR or equivalent)
- [ ] Checkpoint generation with signed log roots

### 1.2 Identity & Authorization

- [x] DID-based principals (`Principal`, `Signer`, `Verifier` interfaces)
- [x] Space identification via `did:key` (`MemorySpace` type)
- [x] ACL with capability levels (`READ`, `WRITE`, `OWNER`)
- [x] UCAN-based authorization structure
- [x] Signature verification via `Verifier` interface
- [x] Access checking in `packages/memory/access.ts`
- [ ] ACL state stored as receipts in the log
- [ ] Authorization binding in commit records

### 1.3 Transaction System

- [x] Storage transactions (`IStorageTransaction`)
- [x] Read/write tracking via `Journal` and `Chronicle`
- [x] Activity recording (`Activity` type with read/write variants)
- [x] Path-level addressing (`IMemoryAddress` with `{id, type, path}`)
- [x] Consistency checking via attestations
- [x] Commit records with transaction data

### 1.4 Document → Commit Provenance

- [x] `since` field links facts to their producing commit
- [x] Index on `since` for range queries (`fact_since`)
- [ ] Add compound index `(the, since)` for fast commit lookup:

```sql
CREATE INDEX fact_the_since ON fact (the, since);
```

- [ ] Query/subscription responses include commits for all returned facts
- [ ] Include older commits if client hasn't seen them yet

**Files to modify:**

- `packages/memory/space.ts` - add compound index in schema
- `packages/memory/migrations/` - migration for existing databases
- `packages/memory/provider.ts` - include producing commits in responses

### 1.5 Scheduler Staleness Detection

Works with current CAS semantics - no commit model changes required.
**Requires activity tracking (2.1)** for path-level granularity.

**Required changes:**

- [ ] Scheduler tracks `since` of each path it reads (from commit activity)
- [ ] On incoming commit, compare commit's write paths against tracked inputs
- [ ] Mark computation stale if `commit.since > tracked_input.since` for same path
- [ ] Re-run only stale computations

```typescript
interface TrackedInput {
  address: IMemoryAddress; // {id, type, path} - path-level!
  since: number; // When this input was read
}

// On commit received (using activity from 2.1):
for (const writePath of commit.activity.writes) {
  if (trackedInputs.has(writePath) &&
      commit.since > trackedInputs.get(writePath).since) {
    markStale(computationsUsing(writePath));
  }
}
```

Without path-level tracking, any change to entity X invalidates ALL computations
reading ANY part of X - too coarse for efficient scheduling.

**Files to modify:**

- `packages/runner/src/scheduler/` - staleness tracking and comparison
- `packages/runner/src/storage/transaction.ts` - expose `since` with reads

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Receipts (Priority: High)

This is the next major milestone. The goal is to enhance commit/receipt
structure to capture computation metadata for verifiability and reactive
scheduling.

### 2.1 Address-Level Activity in Receipts

Currently, the `Journal` tracks activities with `IMemoryAddress` including
paths, but this is not persisted in the commit structure.

**Required changes:**

- [ ] Extend `CommitData` to include address-level reads/writes:

```typescript
interface CommitData {
  since: number;
  transaction: Transaction;
  labels?: FactSelection;
  // NEW: Activity tracking
  activity?: {
    reads: SerializedAddress[]; // [{id, type, path}]
    writes: SerializedAddress[];
  };
}
```

- [ ] Serialize `IMemoryAddress` in commit creation (`packages/memory/commit.ts`)
- [ ] Capture journal activity when creating commits
- [ ] Add activity to `ITransactionJournal.activity()` serialization

**Files to modify:**

- `packages/memory/interface.ts` - extend `CommitData` type
- `packages/memory/commit.ts` - serialize activity in `create()`
- `packages/runner/src/storage/interface.ts` - activity export
- `packages/runner/src/storage/transaction/journal.ts` - activity serialization

### 2.2 Code Bundle References

Track which code produced each computation.

**Required changes:**

- [ ] Define `CodeBundle` reference type
- [ ] Add `codeCID` field to receipt structure
- [ ] Capture pattern/handler identifier during execution
- [ ] Pass code reference through transaction pipeline

```typescript
interface ComputationContext {
  codeCID: Reference<CodeBundle>; // Hash of code that ran
  handlerId?: string; // Handler name within bundle
  version?: string; // Code version
}
```

**Files to modify:**

- `packages/memory/interface.ts` - add computation context types
- `packages/runner/src/storage/transaction.ts` - capture code context
- `packages/runner/src/runtime/` - pass code identity to transactions

### 2.3 Input Provenance References

Link outputs to their input sources for provenance chains.

**Required changes:**

- [ ] Capture `inputRefs` as references to source facts
- [ ] Distinguish between:
  - Direct reads (facts read during computation)
  - Derived inputs (computed from other sources)
- [ ] Add input references to commit structure

```typescript
interface ProvenanceData {
  inputRefs: Reference<Fact>[]; // Source facts
  inputCommitments?: Hash[]; // H(salt || input) for privacy
}
```

**Files to modify:**

- `packages/memory/interface.ts` - provenance types
- `packages/runner/src/storage/transaction/chronicle.ts` - track input sources

### 2.4 Receipt Serialization

Create a unified receipt format that combines current structures.

**Required changes:**

- [ ] Define `Receipt` type combining Fact + computation metadata
- [ ] Implement receipt creation from transaction + journal
- [ ] Add receipt verification functions

```typescript
interface Receipt {
  // Core fact
  fact: Fact;

  // Computation metadata
  computation?: {
    codeCID: Reference<CodeBundle>;
    activity: { reads: Address[]; writes: Address[] };
    inputRefs: Reference<Fact>[];
  };

  // Signature
  signature: Signature<Receipt>;
  issuer: DID;
}
```

**Files to modify:**

- `packages/memory/receipt.ts` - full receipt implementation (currently minimal)
- `packages/memory/interface.ts` - Receipt type definition

### 2.5 Client State & Commit Validation

Implement the nursery/heap model for client-side state and relaxed commit
validation.

**Required changes:**

- [ ] Define `ClientCommit` structure with confirmed/pending read separation:

```typescript
interface ClientCommit {
  reads: {
    confirmed: Array<{ address: Address; hash: Hash; since: number }>;
    pending: Array<{ address: Address; hash: Hash; fromCommit: Reference<Commit> }>;
  };
  writes: Array<{ address: Address; value: JSONValue; cause: Hash }>;
  codeCID?: Reference<CodeBundle>;
  activity?: ReceiptActivity;
}
```

- [ ] Define `CommitLogEntry` structure preserving original + resolution:

```typescript
interface CommitLogEntry {
  original: SignedClientCommit;
  resolution: {
    since: number;
    commitResolutions: Map<Reference<Commit>, number>;
    hashMappings?: Map<Hash, Hash>; // provisional → final
  };
}
```

- [ ] Implement `since`-based validation (not hash-chain validation):
  - Reads must record `since` of what was read
  - Validation: `new_commit.reads[entity].since >= prior_commit.writes[entity].since`

- [ ] Track hash mappings when provisional hashes differ from final

- [ ] Implement server-side commit processing:
  - Validate confirmed reads against current `since`
  - Resolve pending reads via `fromCommit` → assigned `since`
  - Assign next `since` to commit
  - Compute final hashes and record mappings
  - Store both original and resolution

**Files to modify:**

- `packages/memory/interface.ts` - `ClientCommit`, `CommitLogEntry` types
- `packages/memory/commit.ts` - commit processing with validation
- `packages/memory/space.ts` - commit log storage with original + resolution
- `packages/runner/src/storage/transaction.ts` - client-side commit building

- [ ] Time-bound verification

---

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate - Quick Wins (works with current CAS semantics)

1. **Document → Commit provenance** (Phase 1.4)
   - Add compound index `(the, since)` for fast commit lookup
   - Query/subscription responses include producing commits
   - Foundation for scheduler and client verification

2. **Activity in receipts** (Phase 2.1)
   - Extend `CommitData` with address-level reads/writes
   - Serialize journal activity to commits
   - **Required for efficient scheduler** - without paths, any entity change
     invalidates all computations touching that entity

3. **Scheduler staleness detection** (Phase 1.5 + 3)
   - Compare `since` values at path level to detect stale data
   - Scheduler tracks `since` of each path it reads
   - Re-run computations only when their specific paths are newer
   - **High impact**: Efficient invalidation with path granularity

### Then - Enhanced Commit Model (Phase 2.5)

4. **Client state & commit validation**
   - Nursery/heap model for pending vs confirmed commits
   - `since`-based validation rules (relaxed from strict CAS)
   - CommitLogEntry with original + resolution
   - Hash mapping for provisional → final resolution
   - Enables offline operation and stacked commits

### Later - Auditing & Reproducibility (Phase 2.2-2.3)

5. **Code bundle references**
   - Track which code produced each output
   - Essential for reproducibility and auditing

6. **Input provenance**
   - Link outputs to input sources
   - Enables provenance chain verification

### Medium-term (Phases 4-5)

7. **IFC labels** - Build on existing `Labels` type
8. **Merkle proofs** - Enable verification without full log

### Long-term (Phases 6-8)

9. **VCs, Domain bootstrap, Time bounds** - Optional add-ons
