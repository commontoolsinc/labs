# Storage Format

This document specifies how space data is represented on disk and in databases.

## Status

Draft — based on codebase investigation and discussion.

## Current State

### Fact Structure

The fundamental unit of persistent data is a **fact**, structured as:

```
{
  the: MediaType,      // e.g., "application/json"
  of:  URI,            // entity identifier
  is:  Value,          // the actual data
  cause: Reference     // causal predecessor
}
```

The `is` field contains the value, which may include:
- Primitive data (strings, numbers, booleans, null)
- Nested objects and arrays
- References to other facts (via sigil links)

### Result Cell Metadata

Piece execution metadata is anchored on the result cell through metadata fields.
Related cells link back to their owning result cell so traversal can recover the
piece ownership graph:

```
{
  pattern: SigilLink,  // link to the pattern cell
  argument: SigilLink, // link to the argument cell
  internal: [          // manifest of derived internal cells
    {
      partialCause: JSONValue,
      link: SigilLink
    }
  ],
  schema?: JSONSchema, // result schema
  slug?: string        // optional piece slug metadata
}
```

The argument cell and each derived internal cell store reciprocal `result`
metadata links to the owning result cell.

Result-cell metadata enables:
- Identifying which pattern governs a piece
- Lazy loading of pieces when events arrive
- Traversing the ownership graph through `result` metadata links

### Encoding Formats

The system currently uses JSON for interchange and storage representation.

### Streams

A stream cell stores no value. Its document carries a `result` back-link to the
owning piece and a `schema` metadata field whose outermost `asCell` entry is
`stream`, and the links that reach it carry the same declaration. That is what
gives a stream its durable identity and marks the location as an event
endpoint; events flow through it and are never stored.

Documents written before this held a `{ "$stream": true }` sentinel as their
value. Readers still recognize it, and nothing writes it.

## Proposed Directions

### CBOR Encoding

CBOR is under consideration for storage and transmission, offering:
- Binary efficiency
- Well-specified encoding
- Native bytes support

**Note**: Encoding details should not affect identity. The identity hash should
be computed over the abstract data structure, not the encoded bytes. This allows
format migration without breaking identities.

### Stream and Value Cell Unification

With no stored marker, what still separates a stream from a value cell is the
schema declaration and the send-versus-set behavior. Unifying the two via
timestamp-inclusive schemas remains open. See [Cells](./4-cells.md) for
discussion of potential unification.

## Open Questions

- What is the database schema and indexing strategy?
- How is binary data handled (blobs, files)?
- What are the exact persistence semantics for the `cause` chain?
- How does compaction/garbage collection work?
