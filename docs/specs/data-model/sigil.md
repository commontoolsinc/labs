## Abstract

This RFC extends the [Memory Protocol] with a standardized system for creating
references between facts in user-controlled spaces. The protocol defines five
fundamental types of references:

1. **Inline references**: Embed data directly within facts using
   [IPLD data model] types.
2. **Immutable references**: Reference data by content using [merkle reference]s
   which are valid [IPLD Links].
3. **Mutable references**: Reference data by its memory address using `link`
   sigils.
4. **Blob references**: Reference binary data interpreted as `Blob` instances
5. **File references**: Reference binary data interpreted as `File` instances.

These reference types enable sophisticated data modeling including binary
content references, computed data sources, and relational queries within facts,
while preserving the causal integrity of the memory protocol. References are
resolved by the [Schema Query Protocol], which provides the
`/memory/graph/query` capability for advanced querying with automatic
resolution.

## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Motivation

The [Memory Protocol] provides a robust foundation for storing and querying
facts in user-controlled spaces. However, applications need standardized ways to
reference data across fact boundaries with different consistency guarantees:

- **Immutable references**: Reference data that should never change, with
  cryptographic integrity guarantees
- **Mutable references**: Reference data that can be updated over time, with
  automatic propagation of changes
- **Binary content**: Handle binary data and file metadata consistently within
  the fact model
- **Computed relationships**: Establish dynamic relationships and computed
  values between facts
- **Reactive systems**: Build systems that respond to changes in referenced data

This RFC addresses these needs by defining five fundamental reference types that
provide different consistency and mutability guarantees, enabling applications
to choose the appropriate reference semantics for their use cases.

## IPLD Data Model and DAG-JSON Convention

This protocol uses the [IPLD data model] which provides a canonical way to
represent structured data that is encoding-agnostic. The IPLD data model
supports the same basic types as JSON (null, boolean, integer, float, string,
list, map) plus additional types for binary data and cryptographic links.

For JSON encoding, we follow the [DAG-JSON] specification which provides a
standard way to represent IPLD data in JSON format. The DAG-JSON specification
uses the `/` field as a special namespace for encoding data types outside the
JSON data model. We adopt the standard encoding for [bytes] and [links] per the
[DAG-JSON] specification and define our own custom data types under the `/`
field as described in detail in this document.

This approach:

- Maintains compatibility with standard JSON parsers
- Provides a clear namespace for special types separate from user data
- Enables progressive enhancement where simple JSON becomes linkable
- Supports efficient serialization and deserialization
- Preserves the memory protocol's fact structure

## Reference Types

This protocol describes a set of reference types with different characteristics
and use cases:

### Reference Resolution

References are resolved by the [Schema Query Protocol] to reduce roundtrips when
following references across facts. The resolution process understands the
semantics of each reference type and can efficiently traverse relationships to
build comprehensive result sets.

### Inline References

Inline references embed data directly within facts' `is` field using values
conforming to the [IPLD data model]. Binary data can be inlined as IPLD [bytes].

#### Bytes in JSON

Inline bytes in JSON encoding follow the [DAG-JSON] specification for
representing [bytes]. Memory protocol implementations are RECOMMENDED to impose
reasonable size limits for inlined binary data.

##### TypeScript Definition

```ts
type Bytes = {
  "/": {
    /* Base64 encoded binary */
    "bytes": string;
  };
};
```

##### Example

```json
// Binary data using DAG-JSON bytes
{
  "/": {
    "bytes": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNk+P+/HgAFeAJ5gZ5fCQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="
  }
}
```

### Immutable References

Immutable references use [merkle reference]s that provide cryptographic
integrity guarantees while remaining agnostic of content encoding. They follow
[IPLD data model] and are represented as [IPLD Links] with following added
constraints:

1. Immutable references MUST be [merkle reference]s.
2. Immutable reference MUST reference content of the fact's `is` field.

> ℹ️ Above constraints attempt to strike a good balance between flexibility and
> practicality and are optimized for expected usage.

**Key Properties**:

- Reference only the content of the fact's `is` field, not the entire fact
  structure or subset of the `is` field.
- Use the [merkle reference] codec for content addressing
- Provide cryptographic integrity guarantees
- Never change - the same content always has the same reference and same
  reference resolve to the same content.

##### TypeScript Definition

```ts
type Reference = {
  /* Multibase Base32 encoded CIDv1 with 0x07 merkle-reference codec */
  "/": string;
};
```

##### Example

```json
{
  "/": "ba4jca7rv4dlr5n5uuvcz7iht5omeukavhzbbpmc5w4hcp6dl4y5sfkp5"
}
```

### Mutable References

Mutable references use `link` sigils to reference facts that can be updated over
time. These references automatically reflect changes to the addressed data.

**Key Properties**:

- Reference facts by address in memory space using coordinates (`accept`, `id`,
  `space`, `path`)
- Automatically reflect changes when the addressed data is updated
- Support path navigation within the target fact's `is` field
- Provide configurable write behavior through the `overwrite` field

#### Link Sigil (`link@1`)

The `link` sigil provides mutable references to JSON values held by other facts.
If `path` is omitted, it references the whole JSON value - the `is` field of the
addressed fact. If `accept` is omitted, it defaults to the type of the fact the
link is embedded in. If `id` is omitted, it defaults to the entity the link is
embedded in. If both are omitted, it creates a self-reference. The `overwrite`
field controls write behavior.

> ℹ️ Therefore `link` with omitted `accept`, `id` and `path` represents a
> self-reference.

##### Fields

- `id` (optional): Resource URI of the target fact. Defaults to linker's id
- `accept` (optional): Media type preferences for the target fact, following
  HTTP Accept header semantics. Defaults to linker's type
- `path` (optional): Array of strings/numbers for navigating into the target
  fact's `is` field.
- `space` (optional): DID of the space containing the target fact. Defaults to
  current space
- `schema` (optional): JSON Schema for validation
- `overwrite` (optional): Controls write behavior - `"this"` (default) or
  `"redirect"`

#### TypeScript Definition

```typescript
type LinkSigil = {
  "link@1": {
    // defaults to the entity containing this link
    id?: URI;
    // HTTP Accept header format, defaults to the type containing this link
    accept?: string;
    // defaults to the space containing this link
    space?: SpaceDID;
    // defaults to the empty path [] representing `is` of the addressed fact
    path?: Array<string | number>;
    // defaults to "this"
    overwrite?: "this" | "redirect";
    // defaults to any if omitted
    schema?: JSONSchema;
  };
};
```

#### Resolution Behavior

Link sigils resolve to the current value at the specified location within the
target fact's `is` field. When the target fact changes, all references
automatically reflect the new value.

##### Example with Default Values

When `accept`, `id`, or `space` are omitted, they implicitly inherit the `type`,
entity, and space of the record this link is contained in. If all are omitted,
it creates a self-reference:

```json
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "user:alice",
  "is": {
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "displayName": "ali",
    "nickname": {
      "/": {
        "link@1": {
          "path": ["displayName"]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "cause": "da6lce9tv6fnr7o7wwxez9kjv7qogwmcxjacdrod7y6jer8fn6a7ugmt7"
}
```

In this example, the link creates a self-reference to the same fact
(`user:alice` with `application/json`) at the `displayName` path, effectively
creating an alias within the same fact.

#### Write Behavior

Setting a property in the referenced data structure keeps the fact containing
the link unchanged and forwards changes to the addressed memory space.

##### Example of setting property inside reference

```json
// We start with following set of facts
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "user:alice",
  "is": {
    "contact": {
      "github": "@alice"
    }
  }
}
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "profile:alice",
  "is": {
    "contact": {
      "/": {
        "link@1": {
          "id": "user:alice",
          "path": ["contact"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// After profile.contact.email = "alice@web.mail", we end up with the first
// fact updated and the second fact remaining unchanged
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "user:alice",
  "is": {
    "contact": {
      "email": "alice@web.mail",
      "github": "@alice"
    }
  }
}
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "profile:alice",
  "is": {
    "contact": {
      "/": {
        "link@1": {
          "id": "user:alice",
          "path": ["contact"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The behavior of setting a property that is a link sigil itself depends on the
`overwrite` setting:

- When `overwrite` is `"this"` (default): The property is replaced.
- When `overwrite` is `"redirect"`: The property addressed by the link is
  updated.

##### Link Write Behavior Examples

The `overwrite` field controls how property assignment behaves:

###### Default Behavior (`overwrite: "this"`)

When assigning a value to a property that is a link with an `overwrite: "this"`
(default) setting, the property is **replaced with the value**:

```json
// Before state
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "comment:4737",
  "is": {
    "archived": false,
    "content": "Please add code comment"
  }
}
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "note:bcd9124e",
  "is": {
    "done": {
      "/": {
        "link@1": {
          "accept": "application/json",
          "id": "comment:4737",
          "path": ["archived"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// After setting `note.done = true`
// Addressed fact remains unchanged
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "comment:4737",
  "is": {
    "archived": false,
    "content": "Please add code comment"
  }
}
// Fact containing link sigil is updated
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "note:bcd9124e",
  "is": {
    "done": true  // Link sigil was replaced with literal value
  }
}
```

The addressed `archived` property of the comment (`comment:4737`) remains
unchanged.

###### Redirect Behavior (`overwrite: "redirect"`)

When assigning a value to a property that is a link with an
`overwrite: "redirect"` setting, the value in the addressed memory space is
updated.

```json
// Initial state
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "comment:4737",
  "is": {
    "archived": false,
    "content": "Please add code comment"
  }
}
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "note:bcd9124e",
  "is": {
    "done": {
      "/": {
        "link@1": {
          "accept": "application/json",
          "id": "comment:4737",
          "path": ["archived"],
          ”overwrite”: “redirect”
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// After note.done = true
// Addressed fact gets updated
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "comment:4737",
  "is": {
    "archived": true,
    "content": "Please add code comment"
  }
}
// Fact containing link sigil remains unchanged
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "note:bcd9124e",
  "is": {
    "done": {
      "/": {
        "link@1": {
          "accept": "application/json",
          "id": "comment:4737",
          "path": ["archived"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Blob References

Blob references are sigils that need to be interpreted as `Blob` instances. They
can use inline bytes, immutable references for content, or mutable references
(link sigils) for binary data that can be updated.

#### Blob Sigil (`blob@1`)

The blob sigil provides references to binary data that should be interpreted as
a `Blob` instance. It can reference either immutable content via immutable
references or mutable binary facts via link sigils.

#### Fields

- `type` (optional): Media type of the binary data. If omitted and content is
  referenced by immutable reference, it will be inferred from content as either
  `application/json` or `application/octet-stream` depending on the referenced
  content. If content is referenced via mutable reference (link sigil), content
  type will be the `type` of resolved data.
- `content` (required): Either a link sigil, an immutable reference or inline
  bytes.

#### TypeScript Definition

```typescript
type BlobSigil {
  "blob@1": {
    type?: MediaType
    content: LinkSigil | Reference | Bytes
  }
}

type MediaType = `${string}/${string}`
```

#### Resolution Behavior

Blob sigils resolve to `Blob` instances by referencing data through the
`content` field. When `content` is a link sigil, the content type is determined
by the type of the resolved data. When `content` is an immutable reference, the
content type is inferred from the content as either `application/json` or
`application/octet-stream` if no `type` field is specified. When `content` is
inline bytes, the binary data is embedded directly and the content type defaults
to `application/octet-stream` if no `type` field is specified. In all cases,
implementations SHOULD resolve to native `Blob` instances.

#### Relationship to Binary Facts

Blob sigils work directly with the memory protocol's binary fact support by
referencing facts that contain binary data. This approach enables efficient
storage and reuse of binary content across multiple references while maintaining
proper media type information.

#### Example with Link Reference

```json
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "user:alice",
  "is": {
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "avatar": {
      "/": {
        "blob@1": {
          "type": "image/png",
          "content": {
            "/": {
              "link@1": {
                "accept": "image/png",
                "id": "blob:avatar-alice-2024"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example with Immutable Reference

```json
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "user:alice",
  "is": {
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "avatar": {
      "/": {
        "blob@1": {
          "type": "image/png",
          "content": {
            "/": "ba4jca7rv4dlr5n5uuvcz7iht5omeukavhzbbpmc5w4hcp6dl4y5sfkp5"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example with Inline Bytes

```json
{
  "the": "application/json",
  "of": "user:alice",
  "is": {
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "avatar": {
      "/": {
        "blob@1": {
          "type": "image/png",
          "content": {
            "/": {
              "bytes": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNk+P+/HgAFeAJ5gZ5fCQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### File References

File references are sigils that extend blob references with filesystem metadata
and are interpreted as `File` instances.

#### File Sigil (`file@1`)

The file sigil is an extension of the blob sigil that provides references to
binary data interpreted as `File` instances. It has the same type inference
rules as blob sigils, plus an optional `name` field for filesystem metadata.

#### TypeScript Definition

```typescript
type FileSigil = {
  "file@1": {
    type?: string; // Media type, same inference rules as blob sigil
    content?: LinkSigil | Reference | Bytes; // optional reference to binary data
    name?: string; // optional filename
  };
};
```

## Integration with Memory Protocol

### Fact Structure Preservation

Sigils operate entirely within the `is` field of facts, preserving the memory
protocol's core structure:

- `the` field remains the media type of the containing fact
- `of` field remains the resource URI of the containing fact
- `cause` field maintains causal consistency as defined by the memory protocol
- Sigils reference other facts but from the memory protocol's perspective are
  just data structures in the `is` field.

### Query Integration

Sigils work with both the basic `/memory/query` and advanced
`/memory/graph/query` capabilities:

#### Basic Query Support (`/memory/query`)

Basic queries return sigils in their raw form without following references.

#### Schema Query Support (`/memory/graph/query`)

The [Schema Query Protocol] can follow sigil references and return bundled
results to reduce roundtrips.

## Migration and Versioning

### Version Evolution

Sigil types include version suffixes (e.g., `link@1`) to enable
backward-compatible evolution:

1. **New versions**: Can add fields or change behavior while maintaining old
   version support
2. **Deprecation**: Old versions should be supported during transition periods
3. **Migration tools**: Implementations SHOULD provide utilities for upgrading
   sigil versions
