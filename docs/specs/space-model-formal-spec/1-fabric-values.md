# Fabric Values

This document specifies the immutable data representation for the Space Model:
what values can be stored, how custom types participate in encoding, and how
values are identified by content.

## Status

Draft formal spec — extracted from the data model proposal.

## 1. Fabric Value Types

### 1.1 Overview

The system stores **fabric values** — data that can flow through the runtime
as typed values and be serialized to wire/storage formats at boundary crossings.
All persistent data and in-flight messages use this representation.

The key design principle is **late serialization**: values flow through the
runtime as themselves; serialization to wire/storage formats happens only at
boundary crossings (persistence, IPC, network).

#### Three-Layer Architecture

The data model is organized into three explicit layers:

```
JavaScript "wild west" (unknown/any) <-> Strongly typed (FabricValue) <-> Serialized (Uint8Array)
```

- **Left layer — JS wild west.** Arbitrary JavaScript values (`unknown`/`any`),
  including native objects like `Error`, `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, `RegExp`, and `Uint8Array`.
  Code in this layer has no type guarantees about what it is handling.

- **Middle layer — `FabricValue`.** The strongly typed core of the data model.
  Contains only primitives, `FabricInstance` implementations (including wrapper
  classes for native JS types), and recursive containers. No raw native JS
  objects appear at this layer — they are wrapped into `FabricInstance`
  implementations by the conversion functions (Section 8).

- **Right layer — Serialized form.** The wire/storage representation
  (`Uint8Array` for binary formats, JSON-compatible trees for the JSON engine).
  Serialization operates exclusively on `FabricValue` input; it never sees raw
  native JS objects.

Conversion functions bridge the left and middle layers:
`shallowFabricFromNativeValue()` / `fabricFromNativeValue()` convert from JS
values to `FabricValue`, wrapping native objects into `FabricInstance` wrappers
and freezing the result. `nativeFromFabricValue()` converts back, unwrapping
`FabricInstance` wrappers to their native JS equivalents. See Section 8 for
the full specification of these functions.

### 1.2 Type Universe

A `FabricValue` is defined as the following union. This is the **middle
layer** — the strongly typed core. Raw native JS objects (`Error`, `Map`, `Set`,
`Date`, `RegExp`, `Uint8Array`) do not appear here; they are handled by the conversion
layer (Section 8) and represented in `FabricValue` trees as `FabricInstance`
wrapper classes (Section 1.4).

> **Package note:** The data model implementation lives in
> `packages/data-model/`. The fabric-value types and the base classes
> (`FabricSpecialObject`, `FabricInstance`, `FabricPrimitive`) are declared in
> `interface.ts`, and the in-process lifecycle symbols (`DEEP_FREEZE`,
> `IS_DEEP_FROZEN`) in `fabric-bases/`, on `BaseFabricInstance` alongside the
> abstract base that carries them (Section 8.6). The codec vocabulary (the `CODEC` symbol,
> `FabricCodec`, `LiveEnvironment`) lives in `codec-interface/` (Section 2),
> and the machinery that acts on it in `codec-common/` -- including
> `BaseEncodeAct` and `BaseDecodeAct`, which are classes the walk carries
> rather than contracts a caller implements. The conversion functions are in
> `native-conversion.ts` (Section 8).
>
> **Where a thing is declared is not where it is imported from**, and the
> modules named here divide on that point. `interface.ts` and
> `native-conversion.ts` are internal: they are not exported subpaths, and
> their contents are reached through `@commonfabric/data-model/fabric-value`,
> which re-exports them. `codec-interface/` is internal in the same way: it
> is reached through `@commonfabric/data-model/codec-common`, which
> re-exports it. `codec-common/`, `fabric-bases/` and `fabric-instances/` are
> exported subpaths in their own right and are imported directly under those
> names;
> `fabric-value` does *not* re-export the codec vocabulary, so
> `LiveEnvironment` and its siblings come from
> `@commonfabric/data-model/codec-common`. Cite a module to say where
> something is defined; consult the package's `exports` map to know where to
> import it from.
>
> Type declarations visible to patterns are in `packages/api/index.ts`
> (inline `interface` + `declare const` pattern), and must agree with the
> `data-model` declarations — nothing checks that mechanically.
> `packages/runner/` wires concrete implementations into builder exports.

/**

 * persistently, or be transmitted across boundaries. This is the "middle
 * layer" of the three-layer architecture — no raw native JS objects appear
 * here.
 */
type FabricValue =
  // (a) Primitives
  | null
  | boolean
  | number    // any number, including `-0`, `NaN`, and `±Infinity`; see Section 1.3
  | string
  | undefined // first-class fabric value; requires tagged representation in formats lacking native `undefined`
  | bigint    // large integers; rides through without wrapping (like `undefined`)
  | symbol    // registry-interned symbols only (`Symbol.keyFor(s)` returns a string); see Section 1.3

  // (b) Special primitives (FabricPrimitive subclasses — always frozen)
  | FabricEpochNsec
  | FabricEpochDay
  | FabricHash
  | FabricBytes
  | FabricKeyPair
  | FabricRegExp

  // (c) Branded fabric types (custom types implementing the fabric protocol)
  //     This arm covers:
  //       - Native object wrappers: `FabricError`, `FabricMap`,
  //         `FabricSet` (Section 1.4)
  //       - User-defined types: `Cell`, `Stream`, etc.
  //       - System types: `UnknownValue`, `ProblematicValue`
  | FabricInstance

  // (d) Recursive containers -- read-only; see the immutability callout below
  | readonly FabricValue[]
  | { readonly [key: string]: FabricValue };
```

Arms (b) and (c) are a deliberate expansion, not a divergence. The
implementation writes a single `FabricSpecialObject` arm; `FabricPrimitive` and
`FabricInstance` are its only two subclasses, so naming them separately — and
naming the `FabricPrimitive` subclasses individually — describes exactly the
same set while saying more about it. Read the split as this document's
elaboration of one implementation arm.

> **Fabric values are deeply read-only, with one intentional hole.** The
> container arms are read-only, and because their element and property types
> are themselves `FabricValue`, that read-only-ness is inherited all the way
> down: a `FabricValue` tree cannot be written through at any depth. The
> implementation names the two container arms `FabricArray`
> (`ReadonlyArray<FabricValue>`) and `FabricPlainObject`
> (`Readonly<Record<string, FabricValue>>`); this is the type-level
> counterpart of the runtime deep-freeze contract in Section 8.6, and the two
> are meant to agree.
>
> The hole is the `FabricInstance` arm. An instance exposes arbitrary members,
> and a member can change instance state — including which values the instance
> refers to — so the read-only-ness stops at an instance boundary and does not
> reach what lies beyond it. This is deliberate rather than an oversight: the
> intended semantics *are* expressible in TypeScript, but not concisely enough
> to be worth the cost at every use site. Treat the type-level guarantee as
> covering the containers and the primitives, and Section 8.6 as the statement
> that actually binds instances.
>
> **Construction is the exception that proves the rule.** Building a container
> requires writing to it, so the implementation provides
> `MutableFabricValueLayer` — a value whose *root* container is mutable
> (`MutableFabricArrayLayer` is `FabricValue[]`,
> `MutableFabricPlainObjectLayer` is `Record<string, FabricValue>`) while
> everything nested within it remains an ordinary read-only `FabricValue`. It
> is a single construction layer, not a deep thaw, and it is a builder's type:
> a value that has finished being built is a `FabricValue`.

> **Restricted and excluded JS types.**
>
> - `symbol` — **Conditionally** part of the universe. Registry-interned
>   symbols (`Symbol.for(key)`, where `Symbol.keyFor(s)` returns a string)
>   are first-class fabric values: they are portable across realms and

>   unbranded function remains rejected. See
>   [First-Class Encodable Factories](../pattern-construction/node-factory-shipping.md).
>
> Of the two JS primitive types whose `typeof` results (`"symbol"` and

> adds only the branded `FabricFactory` function arm. All other `typeof` results
> (`"undefined"`, `"boolean"`, `"number"`, `"string"`, `"bigint"`,
> `"object"`) have unconditional `FabricValue` arms.

#### `FabricNativeObject`

A separate type — **outside** the `FabricValue` hierarchy — defines the raw
native JS object types that the conversion layer can handle:

```typescript
// Shown at module scope.
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-value.ts

/**
 * Union of raw native JS object types that the conversion layer can translate
 * to and from `FabricValue`. These types sit outside the `FabricValue`
 * hierarchy and only appear at conversion function boundaries (Section 8).
 *
 * Primitives like `bigint` and `undefined` are NOT included — they are
 * directly part of `FabricValue`. The wrapper classes (`FabricError`,
 * `FabricMap`, etc.) are also NOT this type — they are `FabricInstance`
 * implementations that live inside `FabricValue`.
 */
type FabricNativeObject =
  | Error
  | Map<unknown, unknown>
  | Set<unknown>
  | Date
  | RegExp
  | Uint8Array;

/**
 * A `FabricValue`, a `FabricNativeObject`, or a deep tree of either — the
 * values that convert to and from fabric form. This is the precondition of
 * `fabricFromNativeValue()`, the result of `nativeFromFabricValue()`, and
 * what `isValidFabricConvertibleValue()` tests for (Section 8).
 */
type FabricConvertibleValue =
  | FabricValue
  | FabricNativeObject
  | readonly FabricConvertibleValue[]
  | { readonly [key: string]: FabricConvertibleValue };
```

`Map` and `Set` are named with unconstrained type arguments: their contents are
checked when they are converted, not by the type. The constraint has nowhere to
bind in any case while `FabricMap` and `FabricSet` remain stubbed
(Sections 1.4.3 and 1.4.4).

Neither type is ever a member of `FabricValue`; both exist solely at the
conversion boundary (Section 8). Of the two, **`FabricConvertibleValue`
is the one the boundary actually speaks**, and it exists because
`FabricValue | FabricNativeObject` cannot say "or a tree of these." A container
arm of `FabricValue` holds `FabricValue`s, so it cannot hold an `Error`; and a
`FabricNativeObject` is a single native object, not a container of them.
Converting a `FabricError` yields an `Error`, so an array of `FabricError`s
converts to an array of `Error`s — a value that is neither a `FabricValue` nor a
`FabricNativeObject`, and which only the recursive type names. It is what
`fabricFromNativeValue()` succeeds on, what `nativeFromFabricValue()` returns,
and what `isValidFabricConvertibleValue()` tests (Sections 8.3 and 8.4). It is a
precondition rather than a parameter type: the conversion functions that accept
arbitrary input declare `unknown` and reject what they cannot convert
(Section 8.2).

Every arm names a specific native class. There is no duck-typed arm: a value
becomes fabric-representable by being one of these, by implementing the fabric
protocol (`FabricInstance` + `[CODEC]`), or not at all. In particular a
`toJSON()` method carries no meaning here — it is an ordinary member, and a
function-valued member is not representable.

### 1.3 Primitive Types

| Type | Constraints | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `null` | None | The null value |
| `boolean` | None | `true` or `false` |
| `number` | None | Any IEEE 754 binary64 value, including `-0`, `NaN`, and `±Infinity`. See the callout below. |
| `string` | None | Unicode text |
| `undefined` | None | First-class fabric value; see note below |
| `bigint` | None | Large integers; JSON-encoded as base64url (RFC 4648, Section 5) of two's complement big-endian bytes (Section 3 of `3-json-encoding.md`) |
| `symbol` | Registry-interned only | Only symbols for which `Symbol.keyFor(s)` returns a string (i.e., `Symbol.for(key)` symbols) are admitted. Unique symbols (`Symbol(desc)`) are rejected. See the callout below. |

> **`undefined` as a first-class fabric value.** `undefined` is a first-class
> fabric value that round-trips faithfully through encoding. Because most
> wire formats (including JSON) have no native `undefined` representation, the
> codec system uses a dedicated tagged form for `undefined` — the same
> tagged form regardless of context (array element, object property value, or
> top-level value). See Section 3 of `3-json-encoding.md` for the specific JSON encoding. Deletion
> semantics (e.g., removing a cell's value when `undefined` is written at top
> level) are an application-level concern, not an encoding concern: the
> encoder faithfully records `undefined` and the application layer interprets
> the result.

> **`-0`, `NaN`, and `±Infinity`.** The hashing layer (Section 6.4 and
> `2-hash-byte-format.md` Section 4.3) and the JSON wire format (Section 5;
> `3-json-encoding.md` Section 3, `SpecialNumber@1`) both faithfully
> represent `-0`, `NaN`, `+Infinity`, and `-Infinity` as first-class
> values, distinct from `0` and from each other. All four values pass
> through `shallowFabricFromNativeValue()` and `fabricFromNativeValue()`
> (Section 4.9) unchanged — `-0` retains its sign
> (`Object.is(result, -0) === true`), and `NaN` / `±Infinity` round-trip
> through hashing and JSON encoding via the byte-level forms in
> `2-hash-byte-format.md` Section 4.3 and the `SpecialNumber@1` envelope in
> `3-json-encoding.md` Section 3. Value-equality among these values follows
> `Object.is()` — `-0` is distinct from `+0` while all `NaN`s are equal — as
> specified in Section 6.7.

> **Interned vs. unique symbols.** The hashing layer (Section 6.4 and
> `2-hash-byte-format.md` Section 4.6) and the JSON wire format
> (Section 5; `3-json-encoding.md` Section 3, `Symbol@1`) both faithfully
> represent registry-interned symbols, identifying them by their registry
> key (`Symbol.keyFor(s)`). Unique symbols (`Symbol(desc)` — those for
> which `Symbol.keyFor(s)` returns `undefined`) have no portable
> representation and are rejected at every layer. Interned symbols pass
> through `shallowFabricFromNativeValue()` and `fabricFromNativeValue()`
> (Section 4.9) unchanged: round-trip via `Symbol.for(key)` yields a result
> that is `===` to any other `Symbol.for(key)` in the same realm. Unique
> symbols throw with the message
> ``"Not representable as a `FabricValue`: unique (uninterned) symbol"``.

### 1.4 Native Object Wrapper Classes

Certain built-in JS types (`Error`, `Map`, `Set`) cannot
have `Symbol`-keyed methods added via prototype patching in a reliable,
cross-realm way. Rather than handling them with special-case logic in the
encoder, the system defines **wrapper classes** — one per native type — that
implement `FabricInstance`. The conversion layer (Section 8) wraps raw native
objects into these classes when bridging from the JS wild west to `FabricValue`,
and unwraps them when bridging back. (Native `RegExp` is also bridged by the
conversion layer, but into the `FabricRegExp` **primitive** rather than a
wrapper — see Section 1.4.5.)

Because each wrapper genuinely implements `FabricInstance` and hosts a
`[CODEC]` (Section 2.4), the codec system processes them through
the same uniform codec dispatch as every other fabric class — no special
cases needed in the encoder. The hashing system also uses the standard
`TAG_INSTANCE` path for all wrappers. `FabricBytes` (the byte-sequence type)
has a dedicated `TAG_BYTES` tag for content-level identity (see Section 6.3),
but it is a `FabricPrimitive`, not a `FabricInstance`.

The **special primitive** types (`FabricEpochNsec`, `FabricEpochDay`,
`FabricHash`, `FabricBytes`, `FabricKeyPair`, `FabricRegExp`) are **not**
`FabricInstance`s —
they are `FabricPrimitive` subclasses (Section 1.4.6). `FabricPrimitive` extends
`FabricSpecialObject`, and the `FabricValue` union includes
`FabricSpecialObject`, so all `FabricPrimitive` subclasses are implicitly
members of `FabricValue`. They are always-frozen value types that bypass the
`freeze` option in conversion functions. Each hosts its own codec for
wire-format encoding, but bound per wire format — under
`[JSON_CODEC]` for JSON — rather than under the format-neutral `[CODEC]` a
wrapper binds, because a primitive's codec terminates an encoding where a
wrapper's only decomposes. What further distinguishes them
is the hashing layer, where each has a dedicated primitive hash tag rather
than the `TAG_INSTANCE` path (Section 6.3). They do not carry a
`wireTypeTag` property (no fabric type does, save `UnknownValue` and
`ProblematicValue`; the wire tag is the codec's concern).

#### 1.4.1 Wrapper Class Summary

| Wrapper Class | Wraps | Type Tag | Encoded State | Notes |
|---------------|-------|----------|---------------|-------|
| `FabricError` | `Error` | `Error@1` | `{ type, name, message, stack?, cause?, ...custom }` | `type` is the constructor name (e.g. `"TypeError"`). `name` is the `.name` property if it differs from `type`, or `null` if it matches (the common case). Includes `message`, `stack` (if present), `cause` (if present), and custom enumerable properties. The conversion layer (Section 8.2) recursively converts nested values (including `cause` and custom properties) before wrapping, ensuring all values are `FabricValue` by the time the codec's `encode()` runs. |
| `FabricMap` | `Map` | `Map@1` | `[[key, value], ...]` | Entry pairs as an array of two-element arrays. Insertion order is preserved. Keys and values are recursively processed. **Implementation status: stubbed** — the tag is reserved and the class exists, but its members and codec currently throw (see Section 1.4.3). |
| `FabricSet` | `Set` | `Set@1` | `[value, ...]` | Elements as an array. Iteration order is preserved. Values are recursively processed. **Implementation status: stubbed** — the tag is reserved and the class exists, but its members and codec currently throw (see Section 1.4.4). |

(Native `RegExp` is also bridged by the conversion layer, but into the
`FabricRegExp` **primitive** — a `FabricPrimitive` subclass, not a wrapper. It
is therefore listed in the special-primitive table below and detailed in
Section 1.4.5, not here.)

Each wrapper class above:

- **Extends `FabricNativeWrapper<T>`** (which extends `BaseFabricInstance`,
  which in turn extends `FabricInstance`), inheriting the `shallowClone()`
  frozenness-management template method from `BaseFabricInstance` and
  providing a `toNativeValue(frozen)` method for unwrapping.
- **Hosts a static `[CODEC]`** (Section 2.4) whose `encode()` extracts
  essential state and whose `decode()` returns an instance of the wrapper
  class — **not** the raw native type. Callers who need the underlying
  native object use `nativeFromFabricValue()` (Section 8) to unwrap it.
  The wire tag (e.g., `"Error@1"`) is carried by the codec, not by the
  instances.
- **Has `[DEEP_FREEZE]` and `[IS_DEEP_FROZEN]` methods plus a `deepClone(frozen)`
  method** per the `FabricInstance` protocol (Section 2.3); the deep-freeze
  pair participates in the generic `deepFreeze()` dispatch (Section 8.6).

##### `FabricNativeWrapper<T>` Base Class

All native object wrappers share an abstract base class that extends
`BaseFabricInstance` (see Section 2.3) and adds methods for unwrapping back
to native form:

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-instances/FabricNativeWrapper.ts

/**
 * Abstract base class for `FabricInstance` wrappers that bridge native JS
 * objects into the `FabricValue` layer.
 * Provides a common `toNativeValue()` method used by both the shallow and
 * deep unwrap functions, replacing their `instanceof` cascades with a
 * single `instanceof FabricNativeWrapper` check.
 */
export abstract class FabricNativeWrapper<T extends object>
  extends BaseFabricInstance {
  /** The wrapped native value, used by `toNativeValue` for freeze-state checks. */
  protected abstract get wrappedValue(): T;

  /** Converts the wrapped value to frozen form (only called on state mismatch). */
  protected abstract toNativeFrozen(): T;

  /** Converts the wrapped value to thawed form (only called on state mismatch). */
  protected abstract toNativeThawed(): T;

  /** Returns the underlying native value, optionally frozen. */
  toNativeValue(frozen: boolean): T {
    const value = this.wrappedValue;
    if (frozen === Object.isFrozen(value)) return value;
    return frozen ? this.toNativeFrozen() : this.toNativeThawed();
  }

  /** @inheritDoc */
  deepClone(_frozen: boolean): FabricInstance {
    throw new Error(
      `Cannot yet handle deep cloning of \`${this.constructor.name}\`.`,
    );
  }
}
```

The `toNativeValue(frozen)` method returns the original wrapped value when
its freeze state already matches the `frozen` argument, and constructs a new
instance only when a freeze-state change is needed. This avoids defensive
copying in the common case and centralizes the freeze-state logic for all
wrapper types.

Unlike the wrappers above, the special primitive types (`FabricEpochNsec`,
`FabricEpochDay`, `FabricHash`, `FabricBytes`, `FabricKeyPair`,
`FabricRegExp`) are **`FabricPrimitive` subclasses** and do not extend
`FabricInstance`. They are included in `FabricValue` via the
`FabricSpecialObject` arm of the union (Section 1.4.6). See Sections 1.4.5
through 1.4.11.

| Special Primitive Type | Extends | Wire Tag | Stored Value | Notes |
|------------------------|---------|----------|--------------|-------|
| `FabricEpochNsec` | `FabricPrimitive` | `EpochNsec@1` | `bigint` (signed nanoseconds from POSIX Epoch) | Primary temporal type. JS `Date` has only millisecond precision; conversion from `Date` multiplies by 10^6. When `Temporal` is available, `Temporal.Instant` maps naturally (it uses nanoseconds from epoch internally). |
| `FabricEpochDay` | `FabricPrimitive` | `EpochDay@1` | `bigint` (signed days from POSIX Epoch) | Day-precision temporal type. Anticipates `Temporal.PlainDate`. Mostly nascent — class and spec entry are defined, but full integration (Temporal types, calendar concerns) is deferred. |
| `FabricHash` | `FabricPrimitive` | `Hash@1` | `Uint8Array` (hash bytes, private) + `string` (algorithm tag) | Content identifier / hash. Stringifies as `<tag>:<base64urlhash>` (unpadded base64url, RFC 4648 Section 5). The first algorithm tag is `fid1` ("fabric ID, v1"). Wire state is `{ tag, hash }` (see Section 1.4.9). |
| `FabricBytes` | `FabricPrimitive` | `Bytes@1` | `Uint8Array` (private byte storage) | Immutable byte sequence. Input bytes are copied at construction time. Callers access bytes via `slice()`, `copyInto()`, and `length`. |
| `FabricKeyPair` | `FabricPrimitive` | `KeyPair@1` | Either two `CryptoKey` handles, or an algorithm name and the two keys' bytes | Asymmetric key pair. Which of the two states it holds decides what it can do: only the material state has a JSON encoding or a hash, and only the handle state can hand back a `CryptoKeyPair` (see Section 1.4.11). |
| `FabricRegExp` | `FabricPrimitive` | `RegExp@1` | `source` / `flags` / `flavor` strings | Regular-expression value. `source` is the pattern string (`regex.source`); `flags` is the flag string (`regex.flags`); `flavor` is the regex dialect identifier (e.g. `"es2025"`). Stores strings only; `value` returns a fresh native `RegExp` clone per call. Extra enumerable properties on a native `RegExp` cause rejection. |

#### Extra Enumerable Properties

**`FabricError`** MAY carry extra enumerable properties beyond the standard
fields (`type`, `name`, `message`, `stack`, `cause`). Custom properties on `Error`
objects are common JavaScript practice (e.g., `error.code`, `error.statusCode`),
so `FabricError` preserves them in an "extras" bag: the codec's `encode()`
includes them in its output, and `decode()` restores them on the
decoded instance (Section 1.4.2).

**`FabricMap`, `FabricSet`, `FabricRegExp`, `FabricEpochNsec`,
`FabricEpochDay`, `FabricHash`, `FabricBytes`, `FabricKeyPair`** must NOT carry
extra enumerable
properties. Their
stored value contains only the essential native data (entries, items,
epoch value, bytes respectively). Extra enumerable properties on the source
native object cause **rejection** — the conversion function throws. This follows
the principle "Death before confusion!" (Mark Miller): it is better to fail
loudly than to silently lose data. This is in the same spirit as the treatment
of arrays, where extra non-index properties also cause rejection (Section 1.5)
— though the array rule is stricter still, rejecting non-enumerable and
symbol-keyed properties as well. Unlike `Error`,
these native types have no established convention for custom properties.

#### 1.4.2 `FabricError`

Unlike a thin wrapper holding a native `Error`, `FabricError` stores
**structured `FabricValue`-typed state** — fixed-schema slots (`type`,
`name`, `message`, `stack`, `cause`) plus a hidden "extras" bag of custom
enumerable properties accessed via map-like methods. The native `Error`
form is a *projection*, produced on demand by `toNativeValue()` (and
cached once the instance is frozen, when it can no longer go stale).

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-instances/FabricError.ts

/**
 * Structured state for constructing a `FabricError`. Spec slots are
 * `FabricValue`-typed; the optional `extras` carries any custom enumerable
 * properties (also in `FabricValue` form).
 */
export type FabricErrorState = {
  /** Constructor name of the originating native `Error`
   *  (e.g. `"TypeError"`). */
  readonly type: string;
  /**
   * The `.name` property. Pass `null` (or omit) to mean "same as `type`";
   * the resulting instance's `.name` is always a concrete string (`null`
   * is a wire-level optimization at the `[CODEC]` encode boundary, not
   * part of the public API).
   */
  readonly name?: string | null | undefined;
  /** The `.message` property. */
  readonly message: string;
  /** The `.stack` property, or `undefined`. */
  readonly stack: string | undefined;
  /** The `.cause` value, in `FabricValue` form, or `undefined`. */
  readonly cause: FabricValue | undefined;
  /** Optional custom enumerable own properties, in `FabricValue` form.
   *  Keys must not collide with the fixed-schema slot names or with
   *  prototype-sensitive keys. */
  readonly extras?:
    | Iterable<readonly [string, FabricValue]>
    | Readonly<Record<string, FabricValue>>
    | undefined;
};

/**
 * Wrapper for `Error` instances in the fabric type system. The publicly
 * observable state is entirely `FabricValue`-typed: fixed-schema slots
 * plus a hidden extras bag. The native `Error` form is produced on demand
 * by `toNativeValue()`.
 *
 * Like all `FabricInstance`s, a `FabricError` is wholeheartedly mutable
 * until frozen and immutable thereafter. Every mutator -- the slot setters
 * along with `setExtra` / `deleteExtra` -- throws once the instance is
 * `Object.freeze`'d. The codec layer handles `FabricError` via its
 * static `[CODEC]`, which is the source of truth for the encoded form.
 */
export class FabricError extends FabricNativeWrapper<Error> {

The native projection (`#buildNativeError()`, reached via
`toNativeValue()`) decodes the appropriate `Error` subclass from
`type` (via a constructor-name lookup, defaulting to `Error`), restores
`name` when it differs, and copies `stack`, `cause`, and the extras onto
the result. While the instance is mutable the projection is rebuilt on
each access; once frozen it is cached.

#### 1.4.5 `FabricRegExp`

`FabricRegExp` is a `FabricPrimitive` subclass, not a native-object wrapper. A
regular expression is a leaf type with respect to references (it holds no
nested `FabricValue`s) and is reasonably conceived of as stateless: although a
JS `RegExp` carries mutable internal state (notably `lastIndex`), a
`FabricRegExp` never hands out its stored `RegExp` un-cloned, so no mutable
state is exposed. It therefore has a dedicated hash tag (`TAG_REGEXP`,
Section 6.3). Like every fabric class, it hosts its own `[CODEC]` (tag
`RegExp@1`) for wire-format encoding; being a `FabricPrimitive`, it
does not implement the `FabricInstance` members.

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-primitives/FabricRegExp.ts

import { FabricPrimitive } from './interface';

/**
 * Immutable regular-expression value in the fabric type system.
 *
 * The essential state is `{ source, flags, flavor }` — the values needed to
 * (re)construct an equivalent regex. The `flavor` string identifies the regex
 * dialect; only `"es2025"` (the default) is currently representable as a
 * native JS `RegExp`. The `flavor` field is forward-looking for multi-runtime
 * scenarios where different regex engines may be in use.
 *
 * For the `"es2025"` flavor the constructor proactively builds and retains a
 * private `RegExp` (validating the pattern eagerly and making `value` cheap);
 * the retained instance is never handed out directly, so `value` returns a
 * fresh clone on each call. Other flavors store their strings faithfully but
 * cannot yet produce a native `RegExp`, so `value` throws for them.
 *
 * A native `RegExp` argument with extra enumerable own properties is rejected
 * (death before confusion).
 */
export class FabricRegExp extends FabricPrimitive {
  // Constructed either from a native `RegExp` (implying the `"es2025"`
  // flavor) or from explicit `flavor` / `source` / `flags`.
  constructor(regex: RegExp);
  constructor(flavor: string, source: string, flags: string);

  /** The pattern source text. */
  get source(): string;

  /** The flags string (e.g. `"gi"`). */
  get flags(): string;

  /** Regex flavor/dialect identifier (e.g. `"es2025"`). */
  get flavor(): string;

  /**
   * A fresh native `RegExp` equivalent to this value, returned anew on each
   * call so the internal instance is never aliased out. Throws when the
   * flavor has no native `RegExp` representation.
   */
  get value(): RegExp;
}
```

#### 1.4.6 `FabricSpecialObject` and `FabricPrimitive` (Base Classes)

The fabric type hierarchy uses two abstract base classes that share a common
root:

```
FabricSpecialObject (abstract root)
├── FabricInstance (abstract — object-like protocol types)
└── FabricPrimitive (abstract — immutable special primitives)
```

**`FabricSpecialObject`** is the common superclass of both branches. It enables
a single `instanceof FabricSpecialObject` check wherever code needs to recognize
any fabric-system value without caring which branch it belongs to.

It is **nominal**, not structural: the `@commonfabric/FabricSpecialObject` member is a
brand that exists only in the type system (`declare` emits no runtime member,
and nothing reads the key). This matters for what `FabricValue` means as a
static claim. TypeScript is structurally typed, so were the class empty, every
object would satisfy `FabricSpecialObject` — and therefore satisfy
`FabricValue`, since the union includes this type. Annotating a value
`FabricValue` would then assert nothing at all. The brand is what makes the
annotation carry information.

The brand is a well-known string key rather than a `unique symbol` because
`interface.ts` is deliberately free of runtime imports, and a `unique symbol`
would have to be imported as a *value*. `packages/api/index.ts` declares the
identical member; the two must agree exactly, since a value branded by one
would otherwise not satisfy the other.

```typescript
// file: packages/data-model/interface.ts

/**
 * Abstract base class for all fabric-system value types. This is the common
 * superclass of `FabricInstance` (object-like protocol types)
 * and `FabricPrimitive` (immutable special primitives). It enables a single
 * `instanceof FabricSpecialObject` check wherever code needs to recognize any
 * fabric-system value without caring which branch of the hierarchy it
 * belongs to.
 */
export abstract class FabricSpecialObject {
  declare readonly "@commonfabric/FabricSpecialObject": true;
}
```

**`FabricPrimitive`** is the abstract base class for non-`FabricInstance` types
that are included in `FabricValue` via the `FabricSpecialObject` arm of the
union. It extends `FabricSpecialObject`.

- `UnknownValue` and `ProblematicValue` are the `FabricInstance` subtypes
  that preserve a type tag alongside their state (Section 3.2).
- `FabricPrimitive` is the base for types that behave like primitives but
  need a class wrapper (`FabricEpochNsec`, `FabricEpochDay`, `FabricHash`,
  `FabricBytes`, `FabricRegExp`).

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/interface.ts

/**
 * Abstract base class for "special primitive" fabric types — values that
 * behave like primitives in the fabric type system but are represented as
 * class instances for type safety and dispatch. Covers temporal types,
 * content IDs, byte sequences, and similar.
 *
 * Extends `FabricSpecialObject` so that `instanceof FabricSpecialObject`
 * catches both `FabricPrimitive` and `FabricInstance` subtypes.
 *
 * **Always-frozen semantics:** `FabricPrimitive` instances are treated as
 * inherently frozen, like JS primitives (`number`, `string`, `bigint`,
 * etc.). The `freeze` option on conversion functions
 * (`shallowFabricFromNativeValue()`, `fabricFromNativeValue()`, etc.)
 * does not affect them — they are always
 * returned as-is, regardless of the `freeze` setting. This is because
 * their state is immutable by construction (readonly fields, no mutation
 * methods), so freezing is a no-op and thawing is meaningless. Each leaf
 * subclass must call `Object.freeze(this)` at the end of its constructor,
 * after all fields are initialized.
 */
export abstract class FabricPrimitive extends FabricSpecialObject {}
```

Subclasses define their own state (e.g., `readonly value: bigint` for temporal
types, private `#hash: Uint8Array` + private `#tag: string` for content IDs,
private `#bytes: Uint8Array` for byte sequences). The base class holds no
state — its purpose is to provide a single `instanceof FabricPrimitive` check
where code needs to identify these types uniformly (e.g., the conversion
functions' freeze-bypass logic).

#### 1.4.7 `FabricEpochNsec`

```typescript
// Shown at module scope.
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-primitives/FabricEpochNsec.ts

/**
 * Temporal type representing nanoseconds from the POSIX Epoch
 * (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). Direct member of `FabricValue` (not a
 * `FabricInstance`). This is the primary temporal type.
 *
 * JS `Date` has only millisecond precision, so conversion from `Date`
 * multiplies by 10^6 (losing sub-millisecond information). When `Temporal`
 * is available, `Temporal.Instant` maps naturally — it uses nanoseconds
 * from epoch internally.
 *
 * The underlying value is a `bigint`, not a string. This avoids baking
 * in any particular string representation (ISO 8601, etc.) and lets the
 * codec layer use the same bigint encoding as `BigInt@1`.
 */
export class FabricEpochNsec extends FabricPrimitive {
  constructor(readonly value: bigint) {
    super();
    Object.freeze(this);
  }
}
```

#### 1.4.8 `FabricEpochDay`

```typescript
// Shown at module scope.
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-primitives/FabricEpochDay.ts

/**
 * Temporal type representing a particular day, as a count of days from the
 * POSIX Epoch (1970-01-01).
 * Extends `FabricPrimitive` (not a `FabricInstance`).
 * Anticipates `Temporal.PlainDate`.
 *
 * Mostly nascent — the class and spec entry are defined, but full
 * integration with Temporal types and calendar concerns is deferred.
 *
 * The underlying value is a `bigint`.
 */
export class FabricEpochDay extends FabricPrimitive {
  constructor(readonly value: bigint) {
    super();
    Object.freeze(this);
  }
}
```

#### 1.4.9 `FabricHash`

```typescript
// Shown at module scope.
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-primitives/FabricHash.ts

/**
 * A content-addressed identifier: a hash digest paired with an algorithm tag.
 * Extends `FabricPrimitive` — treated like a primitive in the fabric type
 * system (always frozen, passes through conversion unchanged).
 *

 * to the SHA-256-based hash produced by `hashOf()` (Section 6.4).
 *
 * Stringification produces `<tag>:<base64urlHash>` where `<base64urlHash>`
 * is the unpadded base64url encoding (RFC 4648 Section 5) of the hash
 * bytes. For example: `fid1:n4bQgYhMfWWaL-qgxVrQFaO_TxsrC4Is0V1sFbDwCgg`.
 *
 * Immutable: instances are `Object.freeze()`-d at construction time, and an
 * instance owns its hash bytes outright, holding a buffer no other code can
 * reach. (JS cannot freeze `ArrayBuffer` contents, so sole ownership is the
 * defense.) The string form is cached internally so that repeated
 * `toString()` calls are O(1).
 */
export class FabricHash extends FabricPrimitive {
  readonly #hash: Uint8Array;
  readonly #tag: string;
  readonly #justHashString: string;
  readonly #fullStringForm: string;

  /**
   * @param hash - The raw hash bytes.

    super();
    this.#hash = toOwnedUint8Array(hash, transfer);

    return new FabricHash(fromBase64url(hashBase64url), tag, true);
  }
}
```

The hash bytes are private (`#hash`). The public API provides:

- `.bytes` — defensive copy of the raw hash bytes.
- `.length` — byte count of the hash.
- `.tag` — the algorithm tag (e.g., `"fid1"`).
- `.hashString` — the hash as an unpadded base64url string, without the tag.
- `.copyInto(target)` — copies hash bytes into a caller-provided buffer.
- `.toString()` — `<tag>:<base64urlHash>`.
- `FabricHash.fromString(s)` — parse from `<tag>:<base64urlHash>` (splits at
  the first colon; entity URI schemes like `of:`/`computed:` are NOT part of
  this string and must be stripped — and preserved — by the caller).

The `tag` field is an opaque string identifier.
Known algorithm tags:

| Algorithm Tag | Meaning | Hash Algorithm | Output Size |
|:--------------|:--------|:---------------|:------------|
| `fid1`        | Fabric ID, version 1 | SHA-256 (Section 6.4) | 32 bytes |

Future algorithm tags may be added for different hash algorithms or versioned
content-addressing schemes. The algorithm tag is part of the content ID's
identity — two `FabricHash` instances with the same hash bytes but
different algorithm tags are distinct values.

Like every fabric primitive, `FabricHash` hosts a `[JSON_CODEC]` (tag
`Hash@1`).
Its encoded state is `{ tag, hash }` — the algorithm tag plus the hash as
an unpadded base64url string (i.e., `.hashString`); `canDecode()` refuses a
state that is not a record of two strings, and `decode()` produces a
`ProblematicValue` for a `hash` that is not valid base64url. See Section 5 of
`3-json-encoding.md` for the wire format.

#### 1.4.10 `FabricBytes`

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-primitives/FabricBytes.ts

/**
 * Immutable byte sequence in the fabric type system. Extends `FabricPrimitive`
 * — treated like a primitive (always frozen, passes through conversion

 *
 * The underlying bytes are private. Callers access them through:
 * - `length` — the byte count.
 * - `slice()` — returns an unshared copy (or sub-range).
 * - `copyInto()` — copies bytes into a caller-provided buffer.
 *
 * Immutable: instances are `Object.freeze()`-d at construction time, and an
 * instance owns its bytes outright, holding a buffer no other code can reach.
 * (JS cannot freeze `ArrayBuffer` contents, so sole ownership is the defense.)
 */

   *   caller must not use `bytes` afterwards.
   */
  constructor(bytes: Uint8Array, transfer: boolean = false) {
    super();
    this.#bytes = toOwnedUint8Array(bytes, transfer);
    Object.freeze(this);
  }

  /** The number of bytes. */
  get length(): number {
    return this.#bytes.length;
  }

  /**
   * Return a copy of the bytes (or a sub-range). The returned array is
   * unshared — the caller may mutate it freely.
   */
  slice(start?: number, end?: number): Uint8Array {
    return this.#bytes.slice(start, end);
  }

  /**

    // target.set(this.#bytes.subarray(offset, offset + toCopy));
    // return toCopy;
  }
}
```

Unlike the previous `FabricUint8Array` (which was a `FabricInstance` wrapping
`Uint8Array` via `FabricNativeWrapper`), `FabricBytes` is a `FabricPrimitive`.
It does not implement the `FabricInstance` members; like every fabric
primitive, it hosts its own `[JSON_CODEC]` (tag `Bytes@1`), the same shape as
`FabricEpochNsec` and `FabricEpochDay`. The hashing system uses the
dedicated `TAG_BYTES` primitive tag (Section 6.3).

#### 1.4.11 `FabricKeyPair`

`FabricKeyPair` holds an asymmetric key pair, in one of two states:

* It **holds handles**: two `CryptoKey`s, whose material the holding realm may
  have no way to reach.
* It **holds material**: the two keys as bytes, beside the name of the
  algorithm they belong to.

The union is inside the class rather than beside it because the property that
matters here belongs to the value's state rather than to its type. A pair
either holds material or holds handles, and only the first can be written down.
A single fabric type covers the pair whole, so a carrier of one — a message
field, a cell — has nothing to narrow.

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-primitives/FabricKeyPair.ts

export class FabricKeyPair extends FabricPrimitive {
  readonly #algorithm: string;
  readonly #publicKey: CryptoKey | FabricBytes;

    privateKey: FabricBytes | Uint8Array,
  );

  /** The algorithm name, in Web Crypto's normalized spelling. */
  get algorithm(): string;

  /** Whether this instance holds key material, as opposed to handles. */
  get hasMaterial(): boolean;

  /** A fresh `CryptoKeyPair`. Throws when this instance holds material. */
  get cryptoKeyPair(): CryptoKeyPair;

  /** The public key's bytes. Throws when this instance holds handles. */
  get publicKeyBytes(): FabricBytes;

  /** The private key's bytes. Throws when this instance holds handles. */
  get privateKeyBytes(): FabricBytes;
}
```

A pair holding handles is constructed from a `CryptoKeyPair` whose two keys are
a public/private pair agreeing on their algorithm; anything else is refused.
`algorithm` is then read from the keys rather than stored beside them. A pair
holding material is constructed from an algorithm name and the two keys' bytes,
which it copies unless handed a `FabricBytes`, that being already immutable and
sole-owned.

**Only the material state is representable outside a live realm.** A
`CryptoKey`'s material is reachable only through `SubtleCrypto.exportKey()`,
which is asynchronous where a codec's `encode()` is synchronous, and which a
non-extractable key refuses outright. So:

- The JSON encoding **refuses** a pair holding handles: encoding one throws
  (Section 3 of [3-json-encoding.md](./3-json-encoding.md), under
  `KeyPair@1`).
- The **hash** of a pair holding handles is undefined, and computing one throws
  (Section 4.17 of [2-hash-byte-format.md](./2-hash-byte-format.md)). Its
  algorithm name alone is shared by every key that uses that algorithm, so
  hashing it would give distinct keys one identity.
- The **realm encoding** carries the keys themselves (Section 3.4 of
  [4-realm-encoding.md](./4-realm-encoding.md)), which is what a transport
  preserving `CryptoKey` makes possible.

The refusals are the point rather than a gap. The formats that persist and
inspect a value are exactly the ones that must not be able to represent a key
whose whole purpose is that its material cannot be extracted.

#### 1.4.12 `FabricLink`

`FabricLink` is a fabric-native `FabricInstance` — like the wrapper classes of
Sections 1.4.2–1.4.4, but not wrapping any native JS type — that represents a
**link**: the modern, object-shaped form of a reference to fabric data. It
wraps a single **payload**, a plain object (`FabricPlainObject`) of addressing
fields, as its sole nested `FabricValue`.

A link is a `FabricInstance` rather than a `FabricPrimitive` because its
payload is an **outgoing reference**, not leaf data: the payload may itself
carry nested `FabricValue`s (for example a schema filter), so a link is a
small object graph rather than an immutable scalar. Like every instance, a
`FabricLink` is mutable until frozen and immutable thereafter, and its protocol
members (`[DEEP_FREEZE]`, `[IS_DEEP_FROZEN]`, `deepClone()`, and the inherited
`shallowClone()`; Section 2.3) recurse through the payload as their one nested
value.

**The data-model does not constrain the payload's field set.** The value
definition here is deliberately general: the data-model requires only that the
payload be a plain object with no prototype-polluting keys, and treats its
entries as arbitrary `FabricValue`s. Which fields a link carries — and what
they mean — is a **consumer concern**: a module that uses links (for example a
runner's cell references) defines its own payload shape on top of this general
form. Keeping the field set unconstrained is what lets `FabricLink` be reused
across consumers, each specializing the general link value in its own way.

Like every fabric class, `FabricLink` hosts a static `[CODEC]` (Section 2.4)
with wire tag `Link@1`. Its encoded state **is** the payload object: the
codec's `encode()` returns the payload directly, and `decode()` rebuilds a
`FabricLink` from it (or a `ProblematicValue`, Section 3.5, if the payload is
malformed). The JSON wire form is the `/Link@1`-tagged envelope
`{ "/Link@1": <payload> }`; see Section 3 of `3-json-encoding.md` for the wire
encoding, and the migration table in Section 4 for how legacy link forms
(the IPLD sigil `{ "/": { "link@1": … } }`) map onto it.

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-instances/FabricLink.ts

/**
 * A link value: a `FabricInstance` wrapping a plain-object addressing
 * `payload` as its sole nested `FabricValue`. The data-model does not
 * constrain the payload's fields; consumers define their own payload shape.
 */
export class FabricLink extends BaseFabricInstance {
  constructor(payload: FabricPlainObject);

  /** The wrapped addressing payload. */
  get payload(): FabricPlainObject;

  /** The codec for instances of this class; wire tag `Link@1`. */
  static get [CODEC](): NonterminalCodec;
}
```

#### 1.4.13 `bigint` — Not Wrapped

`bigint` is a JavaScript primitive (`typeof x === 'bigint'`), not an object. It
rides through the `FabricValue` layer directly, like `undefined`. No
`FabricBigInt` wrapper class is needed. The codec layer handles
`bigint` with a standalone codec (`BigIntCodec`, analogous to
`UndefinedCodec` — there is no owned class to host a `[CODEC]`); see
Section 4.5.

#### 1.4.14 Design Notes

> **Why wrapper classes instead of inline encoder branches?** Each wrapper
> genuinely implements `FabricInstance` and hosts its own `[CODEC]`, so the
> codec system dispatches every wrapper through the same uniform
> codec path as any other fabric class — no per-type branches in the
> encoder. This gives the codec layer a uniform, simpler
> structure: it handles codec-dispatched values and the structural types
> (arrays, objects, primitives), with no knowledge of specific native JS
> types.
>
> **Decoding returns the wrapper.** The `FabricError` codec's
> `decode()` returns
> a `FabricError`, not a raw `Error`. This is consistent with the three-layer
> separation: the middle layer (`FabricValue`) contains wrappers, not raw
> native objects. Code that needs the underlying native type uses
> `nativeFromFabricValue()` (Section 8) as a separate step.
>
> **File organization.** Each fabric-instance and fabric-primitive class
> lives in its own file: the `FabricInstance` subclasses (including the
> native object wrappers `FabricError`, `FabricMap`, `FabricSet`
> and the explicit-tag-value family) under
> `packages/data-model/fabric-instances/`; the `FabricPrimitive`
> subclasses (`FabricEpochNsec`, `FabricEpochDay`, `FabricHash`,
> `FabricBytes`, `FabricRegExp`) under
> `packages/data-model/fabric-primitives/`.

### 1.5 Recursive Containers

**Arrays:**
- Direct `Array` instances only: the prototype must be `Array.prototype`
  itself. An `Array` subclass instance, an array whose prototype has been
  severed or replaced, and an array from another realm all cause rejection,
  because an array's prototype has no representation as array content, so
  accepting one could only mean dropping it silently. A subclass prototype is
  live code besides — an overridden `Symbol.iterator`, say, makes iteration
  yield different content than the indices do, and freezing the array does not
  change that. Plain objects are governed by the same principle; see the
  object rule below.
- May be dense or sparse
- Elements may be `undefined` (a first-class fabric value; see Section 1.3)
- Sparse arrays (arrays with holes) are supported; holes are distinct from
  `undefined` and are represented using run-length encoding in serialized forms
  (see below and Section 3 of `3-json-encoding.md` for the specific JSON encoding)
- Non-index keys cause rejection, `length` aside: named (string-keyed) and
  symbol-keyed properties alike, whether or not they are enumerable
- Every present index must hold a *data* property: an accessor-backed
  (getter and/or setter) index causes rejection, because an accessor is live
  code rather than an inert value. Index enumerability is not significant,
  because array contents are reached by index rather than by
  enumeration-driven copying

> **Holes vs. `undefined`.** A hole (sparse slot) is distinct from an
> explicitly-set `undefined` element. Given `const a = [1, , 3]`, index `1` is
> a hole — `1 in a` is `false`. Given `const b = [1, undefined, 3]`, index `1`
> is an explicit `undefined` — `1 in b` is `true`. Both must round-trip
> faithfully:
>
> - Explicit `undefined` elements have a dedicated tagged representation in
>   serialized forms (distinct from `null`).
> - Holes have their own tagged representation, using run-length encoding:
>   each hole entry carries a positive integer count of consecutive holes.
>
> On decoding, hole entries are decoded as true holes (absent
> indices in the resulting array, not `undefined` assignments), preserving the
> `in`-operator distinction. See Section 3 of `3-json-encoding.md` for the specific JSON encodings.

> **Array encoding strategy.** Even when an array contains holes, it is
> encoded as an array (not an object or other structure). Runs of consecutive
> holes are replaced by a single hole marker carrying the run length, preserving
> the array structure while efficiently encoding sparse arrays. See Section 3 of
> `3-json-encoding.md` for the specific JSON encoding and examples.

**Objects:**
- Direct `Object` instances only: the prototype must be `Object.prototype`
  itself. A class instance must implement the fabric protocol, and a
  null-prototype object causes rejection, for the reason arrays give above — a
  prototype has no representation as object content, so accepting one could
  only mean dropping it silently. A record therefore has exactly one shape,
  the one the natural syntax produces
- Keys must be strings; symbol-keyed *properties* cause rejection (this
  is distinct from symbol *values*, which are admitted per Section 1.2
  with the runtime restriction in Section 1.3)
- Every property must be an enumerable *data* property: an accessor-backed
  (getter and/or setter) property causes rejection, because an accessor is
  live code rather than an inert value, and a non-enumerable key causes
  rejection because it has no representation as a property name in
  name-driven copying or encoding
- Values must be valid fabric values; properties whose value is `undefined` are preserved
  (not omitted) — `undefined` is a first-class value, not a signal for deletion
- **Host restriction, not a model rule:** the property names `__proto__` and
  `constructor` cause rejection in the JavaScript implementation. See the
  callout below
- Decoding produces regular plain objects, which is the only object
  shape a fabric value has

> **Property names this implementation reserves.** A fabric record's keys are
> strings, and the model attaches no meaning to any particular one: a property
> name is data. Two names are nonetheless refused by the JavaScript
> implementation, `__proto__` and `constructor`, for two different reasons —
> neither of which is a limit of the language, and both of which are removable.
>
> `__proto__` cannot be rebuilt by the copying this implementation performs.
> Records are decoded at each boundary — conversion, cloning, decoding —
> by assignment (`target[key] = value`) and `Object.assign()`, and for this name
> both reach `Object.prototype`'s accessor rather than creating a property: the
> value is dropped, and the copy's prototype is repointed as well when that
> value is an object or `null`. Mechanisms that carry the name faithfully do
> exist — spread, `Object.fromEntries()`, `Object.defineProperty()`, and
> `JSON.parse()` — so what stands in the way is the copy loops, not JavaScript.
>
> `constructor` copies faithfully. It is reserved because other boundaries in
> this implementation already refuse it: the projection to native values drops
> it, and `FabricError` throws on it. Admitting it here would mean accepting a
> key that a later boundary discards without saying so.
>
> The boundary refuses such a record rather than corrupting it in transit
> ("death before confusion"), and a decoder that meets one reports a
> `ProblematicValue` rather than decoding something the bytes do not say.
>
> **This reservation belongs to the implementation, not to the model.** A host
> that does not route property assignment through a prototype chain — Rust,
> Swift, C++, Python, and most others — reserves no names at all and must not
> adopt this rule. Even here it is not permanent: rebuilding the copy loops on
> a faithful mechanism, and revisiting the boundaries that filter these names,
> would retire it. It is expressed as a check separate from the inertness rules
> so that it can be removed as a unit when that happens.

### 1.6 Circular References and Shared References

A `FabricValue` may hold a cycle, and may hold the same object at more than one
position. Whether either survives encoding is a property of the **wire
format and the engine carrying it**, not of the value model, and the two are
separate questions: an engine may preserve shared references while refusing
cycles.

**A conforming engine may support either, both, or neither, and must say
which.** Its documentation states, for cycles and for shared references
separately, whether it reproduces the graph as it stands, flattens it to a
tree, or refuses the value. Silence is underspecification rather than
permission: a caller cannot read the answer off the value, and must not have to
read it off an implementation.

What no engine may do is any of the three silently. A refusal is raised at
encode time, and a flattening is documented — because a cycle quietly
expanded, or a shared subtree quietly copied in two, is a value that decodes
to a different graph than the one encoded, with nothing at either end saying
so.

**Conversion is decided separately from encoding, and refuses a cycle.**
`fabricFromNativeValue()` builds a fabric value out of native data, and will not
build one containing a cycle; it preserves shared references, so the converted
form for a given original is reused and structural sharing survives. That is a
third answer under the same rule, not an exception to it: membership admits a
cycle -- `isValidFabricValue()` handles one and returns `true` -- while this
entry point declines to construct one. A value holding a cycle therefore reaches
the model by being built directly rather than converted.

Note that preserving shared references means preserving _structure_: the same
encoded subtree appears at each position it appeared at. Whether the decoded
objects are `===` to each other is a further promise, which an engine states
only if it makes it.

Cycles *across* documents are a separate matter, and are supported whatever an
engine does within one. They are written as explicit links (fabric instances
referencing other documents), so two cells may reference each other and form a
cycle in the broader data graph without any single cell's content containing
one.

## 2. The Fabric Protocol

### 2.1 Overview

Types that the system controls opt into storability by implementing members
keyed by well-known symbols. This allows the system to encode and
decode custom types without central registration at the type level.

The protocol has two complementary halves:

- The **instance protocol** (Section 2.3) covers in-process lifecycle: deep
  freezing and cloning. Its members live on each instance.
- The **codec protocol** (Section 2.4) covers encoding: each class hosts
  a `FabricCodec` — an encoder-decoder object that is the **single source of
  truth** for how instances of that class are encoded — as a static
  getter keyed by the `CODEC` symbol.

This split deliberately separates wire-format concerns from live in-process
representation: the codec vocabulary lives in its own module area
(`codec-interface/`), separate again from the machinery that reads it
(`codec-common/`), and the dependency-free `interface.ts` carries no
codec machinery at all. Two motivations drove this shape: the seam
between `FabricValue`'s encoding/decoding and the JSON-layer serialization
had grown rough and needed harmonizing, and the previous design had no clean
affordance for legacy-data migration/import (see the decode-only tag
discussion in Section 2.4).

### 2.2 Symbols

The encoding symbols live with the codec vocabulary; the in-process
lifecycle symbols live on the implementation base class `BaseFabricInstance`
(Section 2.3), kept off the pure-protocol `FabricInstance` interface as
implementation plumbing.

There is one encoding symbol per wire format, plus the format-neutral
`CODEC` (Section 2.4). A registry reads the format's own symbol through a
variable rather than naming it, which is what lets one curated class list serve
every format.

Each is a genuinely unique symbol rather than a registry-interned one, so a
member keyed by it is reachable only by importing the symbol. The string passed
to `Symbol()` is a description, for debugging; it is not a key anything can look
the symbol up by.

```typescript
// file: packages/data-model/codec-interface/interface.ts

/**
 * Well-known symbol for binding the getter
 * `FabricClassWithNonterminalCodec[CODEC]`.
 * A class hosts its encoding codec as a static getter keyed by this
 * symbol (see Section 2.4).
 */
export const CODEC: unique symbol = Symbol('data-model.codec');

/**
 * Well-known symbol for binding the static getter `[JSON_CODEC]` on a
 * `FabricPrimitive` class. A class binds its codec per wire format, not
 * once for all of them, where the formats disagree about it (see Section
 * 2.4).
 */
export const JSON_CODEC: unique symbol =
  Symbol('data-model.jsonCodecEngine');
```

```typescript
// file: packages/data-model/fabric-bases/BaseFabricInstance.ts

/**
 * Well-known symbol for deeply freezing a fabric instance in place. The
 * implementation freezes the instance's own internal slot(s) and recurses
 * into any nested `FabricValue`s via a `subFreeze` callback supplied by the
 * generic `deepFreeze()` utility. See Section 8.6.
 */
export const DEEP_FREEZE: unique symbol = Symbol('data-model.deepFreeze');

/**
 * Well-known symbol for checking whether a fabric instance is already
 * deeply frozen, without mutating it. The side-effect-free sibling of
 * `[DEEP_FREEZE]`: verifies the instance's own internal slot(s) are in
 * canonical deep-frozen form and recurses into any nested `FabricValue`s
 * via a `subIsDeepFrozen` callback, returning the boolean conjunction.
 * See Section 8.6.
 */
export const IS_DEEP_FROZEN: unique symbol = Symbol('data-model.isDeepFrozen');

/**
 * Well-known symbol for the **internal** shallow-clone hook: a `protected`
 * template-method member that returns a new unfrozen copy of a fabric
 * instance. Unlike `[DEEP_FREEZE]` / `[IS_DEEP_FROZEN]`, which the generic
 * freeze utility invokes externally, this member is not part of the external
 * protocol surface — concrete subclasses implement it, and the
 * `shallowClone()` template method on `BaseFabricInstance` is its only caller
 * (Section 2.3).
 */
export const SHALLOW_UNFROZEN_CLONE: unique symbol = Symbol(
  'data-model.shallowUnfrozenClone',
);

// Protocol evolution: a further exported symbol, e.g.
// `Symbol('data-model.codec@2')`.
```

### 2.3 Instance Protocol

`FabricInstance` is the **pure abstract protocol surface** — the
`instanceof`-able contract that external code is written against. It
declares every member of the protocol as `abstract`, including
`shallowClone()`; it carries no implementations. Shared template-method
scaffolding lives on a separate abstract base class `BaseFabricInstance`
(below), which subclasses extend in practice.

The instance protocol covers in-process lifecycle only — deep freezing and
cloning. Encoding is **not** an instance concern: it lives on the
class-side `[CODEC]` (Section 2.4).

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/interface.ts

/**
 * Abstract base class for values that participate in the fabric protocol.
 * Extends `FabricSpecialObject` — the common root for all fabric-system
 * value types.
 *
 * This is the pure abstract protocol — the `instanceof`-able contract that
 * external code is written against. Concrete fabric-instance classes
 * extend `BaseFabricInstance` (a subclass of this one) rather than this
 * class directly; `BaseFabricInstance` is where shared template-method
 * scaffolding (such as `shallowClone()`) lives.
 *
 * An instance holds all of its state privately and makes it reachable only
 * through members, so it has no own properties at all. A structural view
 * of one — a spread, `Object.keys()`, a naive walk — therefore sees
 * nothing. Mutable state is exposed as an accessor pair over a private
 * field, whose setter is responsible for honoring the instance's frozen
 * state: `Object.freeze()` bears only on own properties and so cannot
 * enforce that on its own.
 *
 * Subclasses must implement:
 * - `[DEEP_FREEZE](subFreeze)` -- deeply freezes this instance in place.
 * - `[IS_DEEP_FROZEN](subIsDeepFrozen)` -- side-effect-free deep-frozen
 *   check, mirroring `[DEEP_FREEZE]`.
 * - `deepClone(frozen)` -- returns a new deep clone with the requested
 *   frozenness.
 * - `shallowClone(frozen)` -- returns a shallow clone with the requested
 *   frozenness. Concrete subclasses normally inherit this from
 *   `BaseFabricInstance` and instead implement `[SHALLOW_UNFROZEN_CLONE]()`
 *   (see below).
 *
 * Subclasses that participate in encoding also host a static
 * `[CODEC]` getter (the codec protocol; see Section 2.4).
 *
 * The native object wrapper classes (`FabricError`, `FabricMap`,
 * `FabricSet`) extend `BaseFabricInstance`, as do
 * user-defined types (`Cell`, `Stream`) and system types (`UnknownValue`,
 * `ProblematicValue`).
 *
 * Note: `FabricPrimitive` subclasses (`FabricEpochNsec`,
 * `FabricEpochDay`, `FabricHash`, `FabricBytes`, `FabricRegExp`) do NOT
 * extend this class — they extend `FabricPrimitive` instead.
 */
export abstract class FabricInstance extends FabricSpecialObject {
  /**
   * Deeply freezes this instance in place: freezes this instance's own
   * internal slot(s) and recurses into each nested `FabricValue` by calling

### 2.4 Codec Protocol

Encoding participation is class-level, not instance-level: a class
hosts a **codec** — an encoder-decoder object implementing
`FabricCodec<Encoded>` — as a static getter keyed by a well-known symbol. The
codec is the **single source of truth** for how instances of that class are
encoded; nothing about encoding lives on the instances themselves.

`Encoded` is the domain a codec's essential state lives in, and it divides
codecs into two kinds. A **nonterminal** codec's state is made of fabric
values, which the walker goes on to expand in turn; the sense is the one formal
grammars give the word, a state that is not yet an answer. A **terminal**
codec's state is already in one wire format's own domain, and the walker passes
it through. `FabricError` is the clearest nonterminal case — its state carries
`cause` and every extra entry, so it can hold arbitrary nested values, and only
the walker can know what to do with them. `FabricBytes` is the clearest
terminal one: JSON's codec produces a base64url string, where a format carrying
bytes natively wants the bytes themselves.

Which kind a codec is cannot be read off its signature, because the domains
overlap — an all-string record satisfies `FabricValue` and JSON's value type
alike. A codec therefore **declares** its kind by which base class it extends,
and everything downstream reads that declaration.

The kind belongs to the pair (class, format) rather than to the class, and the
symbol a class binds under is a separate question from the kind. Binding
`[CODEC]` is the class-level claim that **one codec serves every format**; a
terminal codec can never make that claim, since its state is in one format's
domain, so a class binding here supplies a nonterminal one. Nothing enforces
that: a registry refuses only a codec extending neither base, so a terminal
codec bound here is accepted and its state reaches the wire unexpanded. A class the formats
want to treat differently — in the state produced, in the kind of codec, or
both — binds one per format under that format's own symbol instead, such as
`JSON_CODEC` for the JSON wire format, and what it supplies there may be of
either kind.

So the symbol tracks whether the formats agree about the class, while the kind
is settled per (class, format). `FabricRegExp` shows both halves at once: it
binds per format, and what it gives JSON is *nonterminal*, expanding into a
record of strings because JSON has no pattern type of its own to terminate
into.

```typescript
// Shown at module scope.
// file: packages/data-model/codec-interface/interface.ts

/**
 * Interface for codecs (encoder-decoder objects). These are objects which
 * can extract "essential state" out of values (objects per se or otherwise)
 * and also take such "essential state" and produce values that are
 * equivalent (in a context-dependent sense) to the values that state was
 * extracted from.
 *
 * `Encoded` is the domain that essential state lives in. Every codec has
 * the same shape whatever that domain is -- the same matching members, the
 * same pair of transformations -- and the domain is the only thing that
 * varies.
 */
export interface FabricCodec<Encoded> {
  /**
   * The unique _direct_ class of instances, if any, that is associated with
   * the format this instance encodes. The codec system uses this to make a
   * quick determination about value compatibility before calling
   * `canEncode()` to confirm.
   */
  get uniqueHandledClass(): Constructor | undefined;

  /**
   * The unique wire format tag that is associated with the format this
   * instance decodes from, or `undefined` for a codec with no single tag.

There is no counterpart interface for a per-format binding, and there can be
none: `CodecRegistry` reads a per-format codec through a symbol *variable*, so
it types a class as `Partial<Record<symbol, ...>>`, which no fixed-symbol
interface satisfies. `FabricClassWithNonterminalCodec` can exist only because
`CODEC` is statically known. The obligation a per-format interface would state
is enforced when a registry is built instead (Section 4.5).

Three base classes round out the vocabulary:

- **`BaseFabricCodec<Encoded, State extends Encoded = Encoded>`**
  (`codec-interface/BaseFabricCodec.ts`) supplies the common scaffolding: a
  constructor taking `(recognizedTypeTag, uniqueHandledClass)`, an
  `instanceof`-based `canEncode()`, and a `tagForValue()` that returns
  `recognizedTypeTag` (a codec with no recognized tag — whose instances carry
  per-instance tags — must override it). It is abstract in `encode()`,
  `canDecode()` and `decode()` and, deliberately, in identity: a concrete codec
  extends one of the two below rather than this directly.
- **`BaseNonterminalCodec<State extends FabricValue = FabricValue>`**
  (`codec-interface/BaseNonterminalCodec.ts`) adds nothing but the
  `FabricValue` domain and its own identity, and the identity is the point:
  `CodecRegistry` reads it to know that a state coming out of here is more
  work rather than an answer.
- **`BaseTerminalCodec<Encoded, State extends Encoded = Encoded>`**
  (`codec-interface/BaseTerminalCodec.ts`) is its opposite number, telling the
  registry that a state coming out of here is the answer. Extending one of
  these two fixes the `Encoded` domain in the same stroke as the declaration,
  so the two cannot drift apart.

`State` is the codec's own state type, a subtype of the format-wide `Encoded`:
what `encode()` emits, what `canDecode()` narrows to as a type predicate, and
the only thing `decode()` is handed. One declaration serving all three members
is what says the three agree, and it is what lets a decoding read its state's
parts as the types `canDecode()` established them to be. That narrower
parameter is true rather than merely declared because the engine asks
`canDecode()` of every state before dispatching one to a codec. A codec that
works over the whole of `Encoded` leaves it at the default.

`TerminalCodec<FabricValue>` and `NonterminalCodec` are the same type, so a
subclass of `BaseTerminalCodec` declared at `FabricValue` would satisfy the
nonterminal half of every signature while classifying as terminal at run time,
and its state would reach the wire unexpanded. Nothing enforces this; a codec
whose state is made of fabric values extends `BaseNonterminalCodec`.

Lookup goes through **`codecOf(value, altCodec?)`**
(`codec-common/codecOf.ts`), which returns a value's class's `[CODEC]`,
throwing a "shouldn't happen" error if the class has none. The hashing system
(Section 6) and other instance-state walkers use it. A `FabricPrimitive` binds
no `[CODEC]`, so the one-argument form throws for one; a caller wanting a
primitive's codec passes the symbol of the format it means as `altCodec`, which
is consulted only when `[CODEC]` is absent. The alternative arrives as a
parameter rather than being known there, which is what keeps this module from
naming any particular format.

Key contracts:

- **Codecs are shallow.** `encode()` returns one layer of essential state
  without recursing into nested values; `decode()` receives state whose
  nested values have already been decoded. The codec engine owns
  recursion and tag-wrapping (Section 4.5), which keeps the format
  mechanics in one place rather than spread across every codec.
- **`canDecode()` runs before every decode.** The engine asks it of each state
  it is about to dispatch, so a state reaches `decode()` only once that codec
  has accepted it and is of the type that method declares. A refusal is a
  rejection of wire data like any other, and the engine settles it against
  `lenient` exactly as it settles one the codec raises from inside the
  decoding (Section 4.5).
- **`decode()` is codec-side, not constructor-side**, for two reasons: it
  receives a `LiveEnvironment` (Section 2.5) which shouldn't be
  mandated in a constructor signature, and it may return an existing
  instance (interning) rather than creating a new one — essential for
  types like `Cell` where identity matters.
- **`recognizedTypeTag` vs. `decode()`'s `typeTag` parameter.** The former
  is the single tag a codec is *registered* under; the latter is whatever
  tag the value *actually carried* on the wire. They usually agree, but
  the distinction is deliberate: a registry can route a legacy or
  alternate tag to an equivalent codec (a decode-only hookup), which is
  the affordance for legacy-data migration/import. The canonical tag
  constants (`CODEC_TYPE_TAGS`, `codec-interface/codec-type-tags.ts`)
  reserve a section for exactly such decode-only "non-primary versions"
  of classes (e.g., a future `Map@2` decoding into the same class as
  `Map@1`).
- **The wire surface is explicit and curated.** Which classes participate
  in encoding is determined by curated `codecClasses()` lists (one
  each in `fabric-primitives/` and `fabric-instances/`), not by ad-hoc
  registration scattered across the codebase. See Section 4.5.

### 2.5 Live Environment

```typescript
// Shown at module scope.
// file: packages/data-model/codec-interface/interface.ts

/**
 * The minimal interface that codec `decode()` implementations may depend
 * on. In practice this is provided by the `Runtime` class from
 * `packages/runner/src/runtime.ts`, but defining it as an interface here
 * avoids a circular dependency between the fabric protocol and the runner.
 *
 * Implementors of `decode()` should depend on this interface, not on
 * the concrete `Runtime` class.
 */
export interface LiveEnvironment {
  /**
   * Resolves a cell reference. Used by types that need to intern or look
   * up existing instances during decoding.
   */
  getCell(ref: { id: string; path: string[]; space: string }): FabricInstance;

  /**
   * Output-contract directive: when `true`, every codec `decode()`
   * implementation that consults this live environment must produce a deep-frozen
   * result; when `false`, a mutable result is acceptable. Same contract as
   * the `frozen` argument to `cloneIfNecessary()` (see
   * `packages/data-model/value-clone.ts`): `shouldDeepFreeze === true`
   * corresponds to `cloneIfNecessary(value, { frozen: true })`.
   *
   * Required (not optional): every live environment declares it. A shared
   * `BaseLiveEnvironment`
   * (`packages/data-model/src/codec-interface/BaseLiveEnvironment.ts`)
   * centralizes the getter with a `true` default, mirroring
   * `cloneIfNecessary()`'s default; environments opt out by overriding. An
   * `NullLiveEnvironment` (same directory) covers environment-less
   * decodes: its `getCell()` throws with a configurable message.
   */
  readonly shouldDeepFreeze: boolean;
}
```

> **Why an interface, not the concrete `Runtime`?** The fabric protocol is
> intended to live in a foundational package (`packages/data-model/`).
> If codec `decode()` implementations depended on the full `Runtime` type
> from `packages/runner/`, it would create a circular dependency. The
> `LiveEnvironment` interface captures the minimal surface needed for
> decoding. The `Runtime` class satisfies this interface. Future

### 2.6 Brand Detection

Because `FabricInstance` is an abstract class, the idiomatic brand check is
`instanceof`:

```typescript
// Shown at module scope.
if (value instanceof FabricInstance) {
  // value is a FabricInstance
}
```

No dedicated type guard function is needed.

> **Why `instanceof` rather than a property-brand check.** `FabricInstance`
> being an abstract class, `instanceof` is both the natural check and the
> more robust one: a property-brand test such as `DECONSTRUCT in value`
> admits any object that happens to carry that property without extending
> the base class.

### 2.7 Example: Temperature (Illustrative)

The following example is artificial, designed to illustrate the `FabricInstance`
protocol. It is not part of the codebase.

A `Temperature` value type demonstrates why the protocol exists: without it, a
`Temperature` instance would encode as a plain object `{ value: 100, unit:
"C" }`, losing its type identity and any methods. With the protocol, the
codec system can round-trip it back to a real `Temperature` instance.

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// Illustrative example -- not from the codebase.

import {
  type FabricValue,
} from '@commonfabric/data-model/fabric-value';
import {
  CODEC,
  BaseNonterminalCodec,
  type NonterminalCodec,
  type LiveEnvironment,
} from '@commonfabric/data-model/codec-common';
import { BaseFabricInstance } from '@commonfabric/data-model/codec-common';
import { isPlainObject } from '@commonfabric/utils/types';

type TemperatureUnit = "C" | "F" | "K";

/** The unit literals, for the wire check in `canDecode()` below. */
const TEMPERATURE_UNITS: ReadonlySet<string> = new Set(["C", "F", "K"]);

/** The codec's own state type: what it writes and the only thing it reads. */
type TemperatureState = { value: number; unit: TemperatureUnit };

class Temperature extends BaseFabricInstance {
  // (deepFreeze protocol members
  //  omitted for brevity; see §2.3
  //  and §8 for the full pattern.)

  constructor(
    readonly value: number,
    readonly unit: TemperatureUnit,
  ) {
    super();
  }

  protected [SHALLOW_UNFROZEN_CLONE](): Temperature {
    return new Temperature(this.value, this.unit);
  }

  /** Convert to Celsius for comparison. */
  toCelsius(): number {
    switch (this.unit) {
      case "C": return this.value;
      case "F": return (this.value - 32) * 5 / 9;
      case "K": return this.value - 273.15;
    }
  }

  /** The codec singleton: the source of truth for encoding. */
  static #codec = Object.freeze(
    new (class TemperatureCodec
      extends BaseNonterminalCodec<TemperatureState> {
      constructor() {
        super('Temperature@1', Temperature);
      }

      /** Extract essential state (shallow). */
      encode(value: Temperature): TemperatureState {
        return { value: value.value, unit: value.unit };
      }

      /** Accept only the state this codec writes. */
      canDecode(state: FabricValue): state is TemperatureState {
        return isPlainObject(state) && (typeof state.value === "number") &&
          TEMPERATURE_UNITS.has(state.unit as string);
      }

      /** Produce an instance from essential state (shallow). */
      decode(
        _typeTag: string,
        state: TemperatureState,
        _env: LiveEnvironment,
      ): FabricValue {
        return new Temperature(state.value, state.unit);
      }
    })(),
  );

  /** The codec for instances of this class. */
  static get [CODEC](): NonterminalCodec {
    return this.#codec;
  }
}
```

> **Runtime validation in `canDecode()`.** `TemperatureCodec.canDecode()`
> above is what lets `decode()` read `state.value` and `state.unit`
> without a cast: the state has been through encoding and decoding and need
> not conform to any TypeScript type until something checks it at run time.
> Every codec owes that check, and `canDecode()` is where the cheap part of it
> goes. See Section 7.4 for the full rationale.

**Why the protocol matters.** Without the codec protocol, the encoding
system would see a `Temperature` as an opaque object and either reject it or
flatten it into `{ value: 100, unit: "C" }`. With the protocol, the
codec system:

1. Finds the class's codec (via the registry; Section 4.5) and calls
   `codec.encode(value)` to extract the essential state.
2. Encodes that state (recursively handling any nested `FabricValue`s)
   and wraps it with the tag from `codec.tagForValue(value)`.
3. On decoding, routes the tag back to the codec, asks
   `codec.canDecode(state)`, and calls `codec.decode(tag, state, env)` for a
   state it accepts, producing a real `Temperature` instance with its methods
   intact.

**Reference types and `LiveEnvironment`.** The `Temperature` example
above is a simple value type -- its codec's `decode()` creates a fresh
instance each time. Reference types (such as the runtime's internal `Cell`
type) use the `LiveEnvironment` parameter to look up or intern
existing instances, ensuring that two references to the same logical entity
decode to the same object.

### 2.8 Encoded State and Recursion

The value returned by a codec's `encode()` can contain any value that is
itself a `FabricValue` — including other `FabricInstance`s (such as native
object wrappers), primitives, and plain objects/arrays.

**The codec system handles recursion, not the individual codecs.**
An `encode()` implementation returns one shallow layer of essential state
without recursively encoding nested values. The codec does not have access
to the codec machinery — by design, as it would be a layering
violation.

Similarly, `decode()` receives state where nested values have already been
decoded by the codec system. Importantly, `decode()` returns the
**wrapper type**, not the raw native type. For example, the `FabricError`
codec produces a `FabricError` instance, not a raw `Error`. Unwrapping to
native types is a separate step via `nativeFromFabricValue()` (Section 8).

### 2.9 Decode Guarantees

The system follows an **immutable-forward** design:

- **Plain objects and arrays** are frozen (`Object.freeze()`) upon
  decoding. This applies to all decoding output paths, including
  `/quote` (Section 6 of `3-json-encoding.md`) — the freeze is a property of the decoding
  boundary, not of whether type-tag decoding occurred.
- **`FabricInstance`s** should ideally be frozen as well — this is the north
  star, though not yet a strict requirement.
- Decoding always produces regular plain objects, that being the only
  object shape a fabric value has.

This immutability guarantee enables safe sharing of decoded values and
aligns with the reactive system's assumption that values don't mutate in place.

> **Immutability of native object wrappers.** Under the three-layer
> architecture, decoding produces `FabricInstance` wrappers
> (`FabricMap`, `FabricSet`, etc.), not raw native types. Because the
> system controls the shape of these wrapper classes, they can be properly
> frozen with `Object.freeze()` — unlike the native types they wrap (e.g.,
> `Object.freeze()` on a `Map` does not prevent mutation via `set()`/`delete()`).
> The underlying native objects stored inside wrappers (e.g.,
> `FabricMap.map`) are not directly exposed to consumers of `FabricValue`
> — callers who need the native types use `nativeFromFabricValue()`
> (Section 8), which returns `FrozenMap` and `FrozenSet`
> (effectively-immutable wrappers) for collection types, preserving the
> immutability guarantee even after unwrapping.

---

## 3. Unknown Types

### 3.1 Overview

When decoding, an engine may encounter a type tag it doesn't recognize —
for example, data written by a newer version of the system. Unknown types are
**passed through** rather than rejected, preserving forward compatibility.

### 3.2 Preserved Tags: `UnknownValue` vs. `ProblematicValue`

Both `UnknownValue` and `ProblematicValue` preserve a type tag and raw state
for round-tripping. They differ in what a preserved tag is allowed to be, and
that difference decides how each reaches the wire.

An `UnknownValue` preserves a tag that **is** a tag — syntactically valid per
Section 9 of `3-json-encoding.md`, though claimed by no codec here. It is
checked at construction. That is what lets the class encode back under the tag
it preserved: a tag a decoder would refuse would otherwise make an instance
that encodes and cannot be read back.

A `ProblematicValue` preserves whatever was at fault, and a tag that is not a
tag is among the faults it exists to report. It therefore **encodes under a
fixed tag of its own**, `Problematic@1`, carrying the preserved tag as data
beside the state and the error. A value whose whole content is "this tag was
not a tag" cannot go back out under that tag.

They differ again in what they do with something they cannot keep, and the two
answers follow from the same split. `ProblematicValue` **normalizes**: a state
that is not a `FabricValue`, and a tag that is not a string, are each replaced
by a debug rendering of themselves, so that reporting a failure cannot itself
fail. `UnknownValue` **refuses**: a tag that is not a tag makes construction
throw, because there is no such thing as an unknown type that has no name, and
an instance holding one could not be encoded to anything readable.

A rendering is deliberately not a conversion — a string plainly reads as a
description of a value rather than the value, which is the honest answer where
fidelity is not on offer.
Each class hosts its own `[CODEC]`, and the two are shaped differently for the
reason above.

`UnknownValue`'s codec is a deliberate "snowflake": it declares **no
`recognizedTypeTag`** (its instances each carry a per-instance tag, which
`tagForValue()` reads back), so it is not registered for tag-based decode
dispatch — an unrecognized tag reaches it through the engine's
unknown-tag arm instead (Section 4.5). Its `encode()` returns the preserved
**bare `state`** (not an envelope), so an instance round-trips to the *same*
storage form as the value it stands in for.

`ProblematicValue`'s codec is ordinary: it declares `Problematic@1`, is
tag-routed on decode like any other, and its `encode()` returns a record of the
three preserved facts (`tag`, `state`, `error`). One consequence is worth
stating, because it is the only place a returned `ProblematicValue` does not
mean a refusal: this codec's *successful* product is a `ProblematicValue`, so
the rule in Section 4.5 that turns one into a raise under a strict engine does
not apply to it. Reading back a record of a past failure is not a failure of
that read, and without the carve-out a strict reader could never read one at
all.

### 3.3 `UnknownValue`

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/codec-common/UnknownValue.ts

import { DEEP_FREEZE, type FabricValue, IS_DEEP_FROZEN } from '../interface';
import {
  CODEC,

import { isCodecTypeTag } from './isCodecTypeTag';
import { deepFreeze } from '../deep-freeze';

/**
 * Container for an unrecognized type's data, used for round-tripping. When
 * the codec system finds a tag no codec claims during
 * decoding, it wraps the tag and state here; on re-encoding,
 * the preserved pair reproduces the original wire form.
 */
export class UnknownValue extends BaseFabricInstance {
  readonly #wireTypeTag: string;
  readonly #state: FabricValue;

  constructor(wireTypeTag: string, state: FabricValue) {
    super();

    // A real tag, so that what this encodes back to is always decodable.
    if (!isCodecTypeTag(wireTypeTag)) {
      throw new Error('Not a codec type tag; use a `ProblematicValue`.');
    }

    this.#wireTypeTag = wireTypeTag;
    this.#state = state;
  }

  get state(): FabricValue {
    return this.#state;
  }

  /** The tag preserved for this instance, read back by `tagForValue()`. */
  get wireTypeTag(): string {
    return this.#wireTypeTag;
  }

  // ([DEEP_FREEZE] / [IS_DEEP_FROZEN] freeze `this` and recurse into
  // `state`; `[SHALLOW_UNFROZEN_CLONE]()` copies the two fields. Omitted for
  // brevity; see §2.3 and §8.6 for the pattern.)

  static #codec = Object.freeze(
    new (class UnknownValueCodec extends BaseNonterminalCodec {
      constructor() {
        // No recognized wire tag: an `UnknownValue` round-trips to its
        // *preserved* tag, which varies per instance.
        super(undefined, UnknownValue);
      }

      /** The instance's preserved per-instance tag. */
      override tagForValue(value: UnknownValue): string {
        return value.wireTypeTag;
      }

      /** The preserved bare state -- NOT an envelope. */
      encode(value: UnknownValue): FabricValue {
        return value.state;
      }

      decode(
        typeTag: string,
        state: FabricValue,
        env: LiveEnvironment,
      ): FabricValue {
        const result = new UnknownValue(typeTag, state);
        return env.shouldDeepFreeze ? deepFreeze(result) : result;
      }
    })(),
  );

  /** The codec for instances of this class. */
  static get [CODEC](): NonterminalCodec {
    return this.#codec;
  }
}
```

### 3.4 Behavior

- When the codec system encounters an unknown type tag during
  decoding, it constructs an `UnknownValue` directly from the
  original tag and (already-decoded) state. (The unknown-tag arm is the
  one decode path that does not route through a registered codec — there
  is, by definition, none to route to.)
- When re-encoding an `UnknownValue`, its codec's `tagForValue()` reads
  back the preserved tag and `encode()` returns the preserved bare state,
  reproducing the original wire format byte-for-byte.
- This allows data to round-trip through systems that don't understand it.

### 3.5 `ProblematicValue` (Recommended)

It is recommended that implementations provide a `ProblematicValue` type,
analogous to `UnknownValue`, for cases where encoding or decoding fails
partway through. This allows graceful degradation rather than hard
failures — for example, a type whose codec `decode()` throws can be
preserved as a `ProblematicValue` with the original tag, state, and error
information.

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/codec-common/ProblematicValue.ts

      }

        };
      }

      decode(
        _typeTag: string,
        state: FabricValue,
        env: LiveEnvironment,
      ): FabricValue {
        // A state that is not this shape becomes a `ProblematicValue` of
        // this decode; omitted for brevity.
        const { tag, state: inner, error } = state as never;
        const result = new ProblematicValue(tag, inner, error);
        return env.shouldDeepFreeze ? deepFreeze(result) : result;
      }
    })(),
  );

  /** The codec for instances of this class. */
  static get [CODEC](): NonterminalCodec {
    return this.#codec;
  }
}
```

A `ProblematicValue` round-trips through encoding with all three of its
facts intact, `error` among them, so a preserved failure survives storage as
the account of a failure rather than as a value that merely looks unremarkable.

This is the trade against `UnknownValue`'s behavior, and it is deliberate.
Because the wire form is `Problematic@1` rather than the preserved tag, a
later reader that *does* have a codec for that tag will not silently decode
the real value: it reads back a `ProblematicValue` and can see, in `error`,
why the value was never built.

Healing is not available to this class in any case. A preserved tag is kept
only when it is a string, and is otherwise a *rendering* of whatever sat in
tag position — so re-emitting under it would sometimes name the original tag
and sometimes name a description of it, and a reader could not tell which. A
form that heals for some inputs and silently produces a different value for
others is worse than one that heals for none. `UnknownValue` is the type that
heals, and it can because its tag is checked to be a real one.

Whether a decode failure surfaces as a `ProblematicValue` or as a throw is the
engine's `lenient` setting alone, not the codec's: a strict engine (e.g.,
tests) raises either form of rejection, while a lenient one (e.g., production
decoding) degrades either into a value. The exception is this
class's own codec, whose successful product is a `ProblematicValue` — see
Section 3.2.

---

## 4. Codec Engines

### 4.1 Overview

Classes provide the *capability* to encode via the fabric protocol, but
they don't own the wire format. A **codec engine** owns the mapping
between classes and wire format tags, and handles format-specific
encoding/decoding.

### 4.2 Codec Value Types

`JsonCodecEngine` uses an intermediate tree representation during encoding
and decoding. This type is internal to the JSON implementation — it
is not part of the public boundary interface.

```typescript
// file: packages/data-model/codec-json/interface.ts

/**
 * JSON-compatible codec value. This is the intermediate tree
 * representation used during encode tree walking -- NOT the final
 * serialized form (which is `string`). Internal to the JSON implementation.
 *
 * Deep-frozen invariant on the decode side: every such tree that
 * enters decoding is deep-frozen, enforced at the one construction site that
 * feeds it, `parseWireText()`. This is what lets the tag-unwrap and `/quote`
 * arms hand back extracted sub-trees directly without further copying. The
 * encode-side trees are transient (`JSON.stringify`-ed and discarded)
 * and are not covered by this invariant. The `readonly` on the array and
 * object arms of the union expresses the decode-side contract at the
 * type level. See Section 8.6.
 */
export type JsonCodecValue =
  | null
  | boolean
  | number
  | string
  | readonly JsonCodecValue[]
  | { readonly [key: string]: JsonCodecValue };
```

### 4.3 Public Boundary

Every engine exposes `encode()` and `decode()`, parameterized by the boundary
type — `string` for JSON, `Uint8Array` for a binary format. An engine may add a
pair for a second boundary type, though none does: a second pair over the same
walk is API a caller can write for itself, and it invites the two forms to
drift.
Both are supplied by the base class and are not overridden: they mint the act
and hand the work to it. An engine is otherwise its configuration — the codec
registry and the leniency setting — and the two factories that say which act
classes this format uses.

The walk itself, and the format's account of how a container is written down,
belong to the acts. That is what lets the walk be written without a threaded
parameter: the state one call carries and the methods that consult it are the
same object.

```typescript
// Shown at module scope.
// file: packages/data-model/codec-common/BaseCodecEngine.ts

abstract class ExampleEngine {
  protected abstract newEncodeAct(env: LiveEnvironment): ExampleEncodeAct;
  protected abstract newDecodeAct(
    env: LiveEnvironment,
    data: string,
  ): ExampleDecodeAct;
}

abstract class ExampleEncodeAct {
  abstract serializedFromEncoded(encoded: JsonCodecValue): string;
  protected abstract encodeArray(value: readonly FabricValue[]): JsonCodecValue;
  protected abstract encodePlainObject(
    value: Record<string, FabricValue>,
  ): JsonCodecValue;
  protected abstract wrapTag(tag: string, state: JsonCodecValue): JsonCodecValue;
}

abstract class ExampleDecodeAct {
  abstract encodedFromSerializedForm(data: string): JsonCodecValue;
  abstract decodeValue(data: JsonCodecValue): FabricValue;
}
```

Minting the act in the base rather than in each engine is what makes
*per act* structural: an engine cannot hold one across calls, because it
never gets to decide when one is made.

`encodedFromSerializedForm()` is where a format checks that what it was
handed is its own. What arrives there is data off a channel like anything
else, so a form that is not this format's is refused by throwing, and
`decode()` settles that against the engine's `lenient` setting — a lenient
decode returns a `ProblematicValue` for a syntactic fault, exactly as it
does for a fault found further in. `newDecodeAct()` sees the same form and
may read something out of it for the act, but it *sniffs rather than
validates*: it runs before anything has established that the form is this
format's at all.

The act is what the walk threads from node to node: the caller's
`LiveEnvironment`, and the values whose encoding or decoding is in
progress. Holding it per call rather than on the engine is what lets
a codec reach back through a public entry point while a walk is already
running — the inner act gets its own bookkeeping instead of corrupting the
outer one's. A format needing more than the base class knows about, such as a
wire marker minted per call, subclasses the act and carries it there.

`JsonCodecEngine` supplies both directions at its one boundary type:

- `encode(value, env?)` encodes a `FabricValue` into the `/<Type>@<Version>`
  tagged wire format, then stringifies the result.
- `decode(data, env)` parses a JSON string, then decodes tagged
  forms back into runtime types.

A caller wanting bytes encodes the string itself. The format's boundary is the
string, and a second entry point for the same walk was API without a purpose.

> **Why the boundary is this narrow.** Tag wrapping and unwrapping belong to
> the acts rather than to an engine's public surface, leaving only
> `encode(value, env?) -> SerializedForm` and
> `decode(data, env) -> FabricValue` — as public API. The engine owns the full pipeline rather than
> the tag step alone, and its public surface says so by exposing no step of
> it.

### 4.4 Encode and Decode Flow

```
Encode:  value -> codec.encode(value) -> serialized form (e.g., JSON string)
Decode:  serialized form -> codec.decode(data, env) -> FabricValue
```

Internally, `JsonCodecEngine`'s `encode()` method mints an encoding act and
has it walk (`encodeValue()`) the `FabricValue` tree into a `JsonCodecValue`
tree, which the same act then stringifies. The `decode()` method mints a
decoding act, which parses the JSON string and walks (`decodeValue()`) the
`JsonCodecValue` tree back into runtime types. The recursive descent and codec
dispatch belong to the acts, and neither is public.

### 4.5 Codecs, the Registry, and Internal Tree Walking

The encoding and decoding logic belongs to the acts an engine mints. It
dispatches per-type logic to the **codecs** (Section 2.4) held in a
**`CodecRegistry<Encoded>`** — an index of which codec handles which class (for
encoding) and which tag (for decoding), built over one wire format, which an
act reads through its engine's configuration. Codecs are shallow: the act owns
recursion and tag-wrapping, and each codec translates exactly one layer.

A registry is built over a `WireFormat<Encoded>` descriptor, which names both
the type its encoded states live in and the symbol a class binds its codec for
that format under. The two travel together because they name the same format,
and a registry given one of each separately could be given a mismatched pair.

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/codec-common/CodecRegistry.ts

/**
 * Sentinel returned by `CodecRegistry.codecFromValue()` for a
 * self-representing value -- one that is its own wire form (encoded as-is,
 * with no codec and no tag).
 */
export const SELF_REP = 'self-rep' as const;

/**
 * Registry of the codecs usable for one wire format. Provides tag-based
 * lookup for decoding, and primitive-type and class matching for encoding.
 */
export class CodecRegistry<Encoded> {
  /**
   * Constructs an instance over the given wire format, which decides the
   * symbol `registerClass()` reads a codec out from under. `format` must be
   * frozen: a registry holds it for its lifetime and reads the symbol on
   * every class registration, so a mutable descriptor could change which
   * codec a class supplies partway through a registry being built.
   */
  constructor(format: WireFormat<Encoded>);

  /**
   * Registers the codec that the given class supplies for this registry's
   * format: its `[CODEC]` if it has one, and otherwise the codec bound under
   * the format's own symbol. A class with both supplies the former, that
   * being the one which serves every format. Throws if the class supplies a
   * codec under neither symbol.
   *
   * This is what lets a single curated class list serve every format. Which
   * symbol a given class binds is a question about that class and that
   * format, and reading it here means no caller has to keep one list per
   * format in step with the others.
   *
   * The parameter is only `Constructor`, and cannot be narrower: naming the
   * symbol a class must bind would name a format, which is the thing a shared
   * roster must not do. So this refuses at run time what a type cannot rule
   * out.
   */
  registerClass(cls: Constructor): void;

  /**
   * Registers a codec directly, indexing it by its `recognizedTypeTag` (for
   * decode) and its `uniqueHandledClass` (for encode dispatch). Either may be
   * `undefined`, in which case the codec is left unindexed for the
   * corresponding lookup; a codec with no `uniqueHandledClass` is
   * unreachable for encoding.
   */
  register(codec: CodecForFormat<Encoded>): void;

  /**
   * Registers a codec for a primitive `type` (a `typeof` result, or
   * `"null"`). Indexes the codec by its `recognizedTypeTag` (for decode)
   * and by `type` (for O(1) encode dispatch on primitives).
   */
  registerPrimitive(
    type: PrimitiveTypeName,
    codec: CodecForFormat<Encoded>,
  ): void;

  /**
   * Registers a primitive `type` as self-representing: a value of that
   * type is its own wire form, so `codecFromValue()` returns `SELF_REP`
   * for it. A type may be both self-representing and have a
   * `registerPrimitive()` codec (e.g. `"number"`: finite numbers are
   * self-representing, special ones go through a codec); the codec is tried
   * first.
   */
  registerSelfRep(type: PrimitiveTypeName): void;

   * accident, everything that factory put there.
   */
  extend(
    ...entries: readonly (
      | Constructor
      | CodecForFormat<Encoded>
      | readonly (Constructor | CodecForFormat<Encoded>)[]
    )[]
  ): CodecRegistry<Encoded>;

  /**
   * Finds how to encode the given value: a matched codec that can encode
   * it, `SELF_REP` if it is a self-representing primitive, or `undefined`
   * if neither matches (the caller falls through to structural handling
   * for arrays and plain objects, or fails for an unencodable value).
   */
  codecFromValue(
    value: FabricValue,
  ): CodecForFormat<Encoded> | typeof SELF_REP | undefined;

  /** Looks up a codec by tag for decoding. */
  codecFromTag(typeTag: string): CodecForFormat<Encoded> | undefined;
}
```

Encode dispatch is O(1) on both paths — there is no linear scan over
registered codecs:

1. **Primitive** — `switch (typeof value)` (with `"null"` for `null`)
   selects a primitive `type` key; the type's registered codec is tried
   first (via `canEncode()`), then self-representation.
2. **Object** — a class map keyed by the value's exact constructor.

#### The default registry

Building a registry takes two decisions, held apart because they belong to
different things.

`createBaseJsonRegistry()` (`codec-json/createBaseJsonRegistry.ts`) makes the
one the JSON format owns: which of JavaScript's primitive types are their own
wire form, and which need a tagged encoding. It registers no fabric class, so
another wire format supplies its own counterpart here without disturbing
anything below.

`createDefaultJsonRegistry()` (`codecs.ts`) adds the classes, and is the
registry the shared JSON codec uses. The wire-format surface is **explicit and
curated**: fabric classes whose instances have a fixed wire tag supply their
codec as a static getter, and the curated `codecClasses()` list from each of
`fabric-primitives/` and `fabric-instances/` is the source of truth for which
classes participate. Each list is read through the symbol its classes bind —
`[JSON_CODEC]` for a primitive, `[CODEC]` for an instance — the wire surface is curated there, in one obvious
place per area, rather than implied by scattered registrations. A caller
needing classes of its own extends what this returns.

| Registration | Codec / type | Tag | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-----|-------|
| `register(cls[JSON_CODEC])` | `FabricBytes` | `Bytes@1` | Via `fabric-primitives` `codecClasses()`. |
| 〃 | `FabricHash` | `Hash@1` | 〃 |
| 〃 | `FabricEpochNsec` | `EpochNsec@1` | 〃 |
| 〃 | `FabricEpochDay` | `EpochDay@1` | 〃 |
| 〃 | `FabricRegExp` | `RegExp@1` | 〃 |
| `register(cls[CODEC])` | `FabricError` | `Error@1` | Via `fabric-instances` `codecClasses()`. |
| 〃 | `FabricMap` | `Map@1` | 〃 (implementation currently stubbed; see Section 1.4.3). |
| 〃 | `FabricSet` | `Set@1` | 〃 (implementation currently stubbed; see Section 1.4.4). |
| 〃 | `UnknownValue` | _(per-instance)_ | No `recognizedTypeTag`; `tagForValue()` reads the preserved tag (Section 3). |
| 〃 | `ProblematicValue` | `Problematic@1` | Fixed tag of its own; the preserved tag rides inside the state, since it need not be a tag (Section 3.2). |
| `registerPrimitive` | `BigIntCodec` (`bigint`) | `BigInt@1` | Encodes as unpadded base64 of minimal two's complement big-endian bytes. Standalone codec in `codec-json/` — no owned class to host a codec getter. |
| 〃 | `SpecialNumberCodec` (`number`) | `SpecialNumber@1` | Catches `-0` / `NaN` / `±Infinity`; finite numbers fall to self-representation. |
| 〃 | `SymbolCodec` (`symbol`) | `Symbol@1` | Registry-interned symbols only; an uninterned symbol matches no codec and is correctly unencodable. |
| 〃 | `UndefinedCodec` (`undefined`) | `Undefined@1` | Stateless; state is `null`. |
| `registerSelfRep` | `null`, `boolean`, `number`, `string` | _(none)_ | Self-representing: emitted as-is. `number` is registered both ways; the codec is tried first. |

The canonical tag strings live in `CODEC_TYPE_TAGS`
(`codec-interface/codec-type-tags.ts`); the structural meta tags (`quote`,
`hole`, `object`) live in `CODEC_META_TAGS`
(`codec-interface/codec-meta-tags.ts`).

An un-codec'd `FabricSpecialObject` reaching the encoder is a **hard
error** — every wire form is explicitly represented; there is no implicit
fallback for fabric classes. Arrays and plain objects (the structural
types) are handled by the walker itself after no codec matches.

#### The encode walk (`encodeValue()`)

The encoding act's walk processes the `FabricValue` tree:

1. **Codec dispatch** — `codecFromValue()` finds how to encode the value.
   A `SELF_REP` result means the value is its own wire form (emitted
   as-is). A codec result drives the standard tagged encoding: the walker
   reads the tag via `codec.tagForValue(value)`, gets one shallow layer of
   state via `codec.encode(value)`, **recursively encodes that state
   itself**, and wraps the result as `{ "/<tag>": state }`. (The walker
   uses `tagForValue()` rather than any property of the value, because it
   is up to the codec — not the value — to determine the correct tag.)
2. **Mandate guard** — a `FabricSpecialObject` that no codec matched is a
   hard error: every fabric class's wire form must be explicitly
   represented by a registered codec.
3. **Arrays** — encoded element-by-element; sparse arrays use
   run-length encoded `hole` entries (Section 1.5).
4. **Plain objects** — encoded key-by-key, iterating keys in UTF-8 byte
   order (matching the canonical key order used by hashing; see Section 10
   of `3-json-encoding.md`), making the encoding deterministic across
   insertion orders; `/object` / `/quote` escaping applied per Section 6
   of `3-json-encoding.md`.

Circular references are detected via a `Set<object>` tracked during the walk.

#### The decode walk (`decodeValue()`)

The decoding act's walk processes the `JsonCodecValue` tree:

1. **Tag unwrapping** — checks for single-key objects with `/`-prefixed
   keys.
2. **Structural escapes** — handles `/quote` (literal pass-through) and
   `/object` (entry-by-entry decode), per Section 6 of
   `3-json-encoding.md`.
3. **State decode + tag syntax check** — for any other tag, the walker first
   recursively decodes the wrapped state, then rejects any tag that is not
   syntactically a type tag as an encoding error: a bare `"/"` key (the
   empty tag), and equally a name that is not of the `<Type>@<Version>`
   form, such as a meta-tag met outside the context that defines it. That
   rejection, and every other malformed-wire fault the walker finds for
   itself, is settled against `lenient` exactly as a codec's is: a
   `ProblematicValue` leniently (Section 3.5), a raise strictly (see also
   Section 9 of `3-json-encoding.md`).
4. **Codec dispatch** — `codecFromTag()` routes the tag to its registered
   codec's `decode()`, and settles the codec's verdict against `lenient`:
   leniently, a throw becomes a `ProblematicValue`; strictly, a
   `ProblematicValue` the codec returned becomes a throw. Values returned
   from this arm
   are guaranteed deep-frozen at the walker boundary (the contract holds
   for both the codec-produced value and the lenient-mode
   `ProblematicValue`), so callers need not each freeze. Every other arm
   guarantees the same, the unknown-tag arm (step 5) included, so a caller
   need not ask which arm produced what it was handed. See Section 8.6 for
   the full deep-freeze protocol and the egress-freezing call sites.
5. **Unknown tags** — a syntactically valid tag with no registered codec
   produces an `UnknownValue` wrapping the tag and (already-decoded) state,
   preserving the form for round-tripping (Section 3). Syntax is what
   separates this from step 3: a tag names a type nothing here knows,
   whereas a non-tag names nothing at all.
6. **Primitives** — pass through.
7. **Arrays** — recursively decoded; `hole` entries decoded as
   true holes (absent indices).
8. **Plain objects** — recursively decoded; output frozen. Any
   `/`-prefixed key in a plain (non-single-key-tagged) object is reserved, as
   is any name this runtime reserves: rather than silently round-trip it, the
   walker rejects it, settled against `lenient` as in step 3 (Section 9 of
   `3-json-encoding.md`).

### 4.6 Separation of Concerns

This architecture enables:

- **Protocol versioning**: Same class, different tags in v1 vs v2.
- **Format flexibility**: JSON context vs CBOR context vs Automerge context.
- **Migration paths**: Old context reads legacy format, new context writes
  modern format.
- **Testing**: Mock contexts for unit tests.

### 4.7 Encoding Boundaries

The boundaries where encoding occurs:

| Boundary | Packages | Direction |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Persistence** | `memory` <-> database | read/write |
| **Iframe sandbox** | `runner` <-> `iframe-sandbox` | `postMessage` |
| **Background service** | `shell` <-> `background-piece-service` | worker messages |
| **HTML reconciler** | `html` reconciler (runs in a web worker) | worker messages |
| **Network sync** | `toolshed` <-> remote peers | WebSocket/HTTP |
| **Cross-space** | space A <-> space B | if in separate processes |

Each boundary uses a codec engine appropriate to its format and
version requirements.

> **Note:** The `html` package reconciler (`html/src/worker/reconciler.ts`)
> calls `convertCellsToLinks` in a web worker context. Threading encoding
> options to this call site requires worker-initialization-time configuration,
> since the reconciler does not have direct access to a `Runtime` instance.

### 4.8 JSON Encoding

The storage boundary routes through functions that bridge between the
storage layer (JSON strings) and the runtime layer (`FabricValue`). These
functions live in the package's codec-defaults module
(`packages/data-model/src/codecs.ts`), which pairs the JSON format with the
set of fabric classes this package defines. The format itself, and the
recognizer for text in it, live one layer down in
`packages/data-model/src/codec-json/`.

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/src/codecs.ts

/**
 * Encodes a fabric value to a JSON string in the standard `FabricValue`
 * JSON-embedded encoding, prefixed with the format-identifying tag
 * `fvj1:`.
 */
export function jsonFromFabricValue(value: FabricValue): string;

/**
 * Decodes a string in the `FabricValue` JSON-embedded encoding format. If no
 * live environment is given, {@link NULL_LIVE_ENVIRONMENT} is substituted,
 * which throws if any decoding is needed.
 */
export function fabricFromJsonValue(
  json: string,
  env?: LiveEnvironment,
): FabricValue;

/**
 * Like `fabricFromJsonValue()`, except the decoded result is expected to be a
 * plain object. Throws if it turns out to be something else.
 */
export function plainObjectFromJson<T extends object = object>(
  json: string,
  env?: LiveEnvironment,
): T;
```

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/src/codec-json/JsonCodecEngine.ts

declare class ExampleJsonCodecEngine {
  /**
   * Indicates if the given text has a "first-blush" appearance as text in the
   * JSON-embedded encoding (i.e., carries the `fvj1:` prefix).
   */
  static seemsLikeEncoded(value: string): boolean;
}
```

`codecs.ts` creates a single stateless `JsonCodecEngine` instance at module load
time and reuses it for all encode/decode operations.

The `memory` package wraps these at its encoding boundary
(`packages/memory/v2.ts`):

- **Write path:** `encodeMemoryBoundary(value)` calls
  `jsonFromFabricValue(value)`.
- **Read path:** `decodeMemoryBoundary(source)` calls
  `fabricFromJsonValue(source, env)` with a memory `LiveEnvironment`.

### 4.9 Fabric Value Conversion

The native-to-fabric-value boundary is managed by
`packages/data-model/native-conversion.ts`. This module provides
`fabricFromNativeValue()` / `nativeFromFabricValue()` functions that bridge
the left layer (JS wild west) and the middle layer (`FabricValue`) at the
`Cell` read/write boundary.

The module also provides a shallow conversion function
(`shallowFabricFromNativeValue()`) and a type-check function
(`isValidFabricConvertibleValue()`). The public surface is re-exported from
`fabric-value.ts`, which also defines the comparison function `valueEqual()`.

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/native-conversion.ts

/**
 * Convert a native JS value to fabric form (deep, recursive). Wraps native
 * types into fabric wrappers (Section 8.2). When `freeze` is `true` (the
 * default), the result tree is deep-frozen; when `false`, wrapping and
 * validation still occur but the result is left mutable. An input that is
 * already a deep-frozen `FabricValue` is returned as-is (identity
 * optimization).
 */
export function fabricFromNativeValue(
  value: unknown,
  freeze = true,
): FabricValue;

/**
 * Convert a fabric value back to native form, unwrapping fabric wrappers
 * back to native JS types (Section 8.4).
 */
export function nativeFromFabricValue(
  value: FabricValue,
  frozen?: boolean,
): FabricValue;
```

In the `Cell` implementation:

- **Read path:** `Cell.getRaw()` calls `nativeFromFabricValue(value)` to
  unwrap fabric wrappers before returning values to the JS wild west.
- **Write path:** `Cell.setRaw()` calls `fabricFromNativeValue(value)` to
  wrap native types into fabric form before storing.

#### Module structure

The implementation is split across several files for separation of concerns:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `fabric-value.ts` | Public surface: re-exports the conversion functions (from `native-conversion.ts`), the type declarations (from `interface.ts`), and the clone helpers (from `value-clone.ts`); defines `valueEqual()` |
| `native-conversion.ts` | Conversion: `fabricFromNativeValue`, `shallowFabricFromNativeValue`, `nativeFromFabricValue`, `isValidFabricConvertibleValue` |
| `fabric-bases/` | The abstract bases a concrete fabric value extends, one per branch of the type hierarchy: `BaseFabricInstance.ts`, `BaseFabricPrimitive.ts` (plus an `index.ts` barrel). These are the implementer's half of the hierarchy; `interface.ts` is the client's, and reaching it does not reach these. |
| `fabric-instances/` | Concrete `FabricInstance` subclasses, each in its own file: `FabricNativeWrapper.ts`, `FabricError.ts`, `FabricLink.ts`, `FabricMap.ts`, `FabricSet.ts` (plus an `index.ts` barrel). `UnknownValue` and `ProblematicValue` are `FabricInstance`s too, but live in `codec-common/`, existing only as products of a decode fault. |
| `fabric-primitives/` | Concrete `FabricPrimitive` subclasses, each in its own file: `FabricBytes.ts`, `FabricHash.ts`, `FabricEpochNsec.ts`, `FabricEpochDay.ts`, `FabricRegExp.ts` (plus an `index.ts` barrel). |

## 5. JSON Encoding for Special Types

The JSON encoding for fabric values — the `/<Type>@<Version>` wire format,
type encodings, escaping mechanisms, and the `/`-key reservation rule — is
specified in a dedicated document:

**See [`3-json-encoding.md`](./3-json-encoding.md)**

## 6. Hashing

### 6.1 Overview

The system uses hashing for content-based identity. The hashing scheme
operates directly on the natural data structure without intermediate tree
construction.

### 6.2 Design Principles

- Traverse the natural data structure directly (no intermediate tree
  construction).
- Sort plain-object keys lexicographically; preserve array element order and
  `FabricMap`/`FabricSet` insertion order.
- Hash type tags + content in a single pass.
- No intermediate allocations beyond the hash state.
- The hash reflects the logical content, not any particular encoding or
  intermediate representation.

### 6.3 Suggested Tag Bytes

The following single-byte type tags are used by the hash byte format and are
recommended for any binary encoding of `FabricValue`s. They are
organized into four categories by high nibble:

**Meta tags (`0x0N`)** — structural markers that are not themselves value types:

| Tag               | Hex    | Decimal | Used for                        |
|:------------------|:-------|:--------|:--------------------------------|
| `TAG_END`         | `0x00` | 0       | end-of-sequence sentinel         |
| `TAG_HOLE`        | `0x01` | 1       | sparse array holes (run-length) |

**Compound tags (`0x1N`)** — containers whose children are tagged values:

| Tag               | Hex    | Decimal | Used for                        |
|:------------------|:-------|:--------|:--------------------------------|
| `TAG_ARRAY`       | `0x10` | 16      | plain arrays                    |
| `TAG_OBJECT`      | `0x11` | 17      | plain objects                   |
| `TAG_INSTANCE`    | `0x12` | 18      | `FabricInstance` (general)    |

**Primitive tags (`0x2N`)** — leaf value types:

| Tag               | Hex    | Decimal | Used for                          |
|:------------------|:-------|:--------|:----------------------------------|
| `TAG_NULL`        | `0x20` | 32      | `null`                            |
| `TAG_UNDEFINED`   | `0x21` | 33      | `undefined`                       |
| `TAG_BOOLEAN`     | `0x22` | 34      | `boolean`                         |
| `TAG_NUMBER`      | `0x23` | 35      | `number` (any IEEE 754 binary64)  |
| `TAG_STRING`      | `0x24` | 36      | `string` (direct form)            |
| `TAG_BYTES`       | `0x25` | 37      | `FabricBytes`                     |
| `TAG_BIGINT`      | `0x26` | 38      | `bigint`                          |
| `TAG_EPOCH_NSEC`  | `0x27` | 39      | `FabricEpochNsec`                 |
| `TAG_EPOCH_DAY`   | `0x28` | 40      | `FabricEpochDay`                  |
| `TAG_HASH`        | `0x29` | 41      | `FabricHash`                      |
| `TAG_SYMBOL`      | `0x2A` | 42      | `symbol` (registry-interned only) |
| `TAG_REGEXP`      | `0x2B` | 43      | `FabricRegExp`                    |
| `TAG_KEY_PAIR`    | `0x2C` | 44      | `FabricKeyPair` (holding material) |

**Optimized tags (`0xFN`)** — hash-level substitutes that replace the raw
payload of a primitive type with a digest, when doing so shortens the byte
stream fed to the outer hasher:

| Tag                | Hex    | Decimal | Used for                                 |
|:-------------------|:-------|:--------|:-----------------------------------------|
| `TAG_STRING_HASH`  | `0xF0` | 240     | `string` (hashed form; see byte-format spec §4.4) |

All unassigned values are reserved for future use. The category structure
(meta/compound/primitive/optimized) is a convention for readability and is not
enforced by the encoding — a decoder should handle any tag byte it encounters
regardless of nibble range.

> **Scope.** These tag bytes are defined here for use by any wire format that
> needs to distinguish `FabricValue` types at the byte level. The hash byte
> format (`2-hash-byte-format.md`) is the first consumer; future binary
> encoding formats may reuse the same tag assignments.

### 6.4 Hashing Algorithm

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/value-hash.ts

/**
 * Compute a hash for a fabric value. The hash is encoding-independent:
 * the same identity whether later serialized to JSON, CBOR, or any
 * other format.
 *
 * The digest algorithm is SHA-256. Future additions (e.g., BLAKE2b)
 * would use the same byte-level input format; only the digest function
 * changes.
 *
 * The return value is a `FabricHash` instance (Section 1.4.9),
 * which encapsulates the raw hash bytes and the algorithm tag. The
 * algorithm tag for SHA-256 is `fid1` ("fabric ID, v1"). Callers who
 * need a string representation can call `toString()` on the result,
 * which produces `<tag>:<base64urlhash>` (unpadded base64url with the
 * URL-safe alphabet `A-Za-z0-9-_`, per RFC 4648 Section 5; see
 * Section 3 of `3-json-encoding.md`).
 *
 * Two public entry points are provided:
 * - `hashOf(value)` — returns a `FabricHash`.
 * - `hashStringOf(value)` — returns a plain `string` (the hash
 *   as base64url, without the algorithm tag). This avoids `FabricHash`
 *   allocation when only the string form is needed.
 *
 * Both functions cache results: constants for `null`, `undefined`,
 * `true`, `false`; an LRU cache for primitives (`string`, `number`,
 * `bigint`); and a WeakMap for deep-frozen objects.
 *
 * Native `Date`, `RegExp`, and `Uint8Array` values are handled via
 * on-the-fly conversion to their fabric equivalents
 * (`shallowFabricFromNativeValue`), then hashed in their converted
 * form.
 */

  //                        (algorithm tag as a tagged string, then raw hash bytes)
  // - array:               hash(TAG_ARRAY, ...elements, TAG_END)
  //                        Elements are hashed in index order:
  //                          if `i in array`: hashOf(array[i])
  //                          else (hole run): hash(TAG_HOLE, leb128(N))
  //                        TAG_END marks the end of the element sequence.
  //                        (order-preserving)
  //
  //                        Holes use run-length encoding in the hash
  //                        stream, matching the wire format: a maximal
  //                        run of N consecutive holes is hashed as a
  //                        single `TAG_HOLE` followed by the run length
  //                        (unsigned LEB128). A single hole is
  //                        `hash(TAG_HOLE, leb128(1))`.
  //
  //                        Runs MUST be maximal — consecutive holes are
  //                        always coalesced into a single TAG_HOLE entry
  //                        so the hash is canonical. (An implementation
  //                        must not split a run of 10 holes into two
  //                        runs of 5; this would produce a different
  //                        hash.)
  //
  //                        When hashing from the wire format, each
  //                        `hole` entry maps directly to one
  //                        `TAG_HOLE + leb128(N)` in the hash (since
  //                        the wire format also uses maximal runs).
  //                        When hashing from an in-memory array, the
  //                        implementation must count consecutive absent
  //                        indices to form maximal runs.
  // - object:              hash(TAG_OBJECT, ...sortedKeyValuePairs, TAG_END)
  //                        Keys sorted lexicographically by UTF-8.
  //                        Each pair: hashStr(key) + tagged value.
  //                        TAG_END marks the end of the pair sequence.
  // - `FabricInstance`:  hash(TAG_INSTANCE, hashStr(codec.tagForValue(v)),
  //                              hashOf(codec.encode(v)))
  //                        where `codec` is `codecOf(v)` -- the class's
  //                        `[CODEC]` (Section 2.4), the same source of
  //                        truth the codec layer uses.
  //
  // The native object wrappers and temporal types are hashed as follows:
  //
  // - `FabricError`, `FabricMap`, `FabricSet`,
  //   and other `FabricInstance`s with recursively-processable
  //   encoded state are hashed via TAG_INSTANCE:
  //     hash(TAG_INSTANCE, hashStr(codec.tagForValue(v)),
  //          hashOf(codec.encode(v)))
  //
  // - `FabricBytes` uses TAG_BYTES (dedicated primitive tag).
  // - `FabricEpochNsec` uses TAG_EPOCH_NSEC (dedicated primitive tag).
  // - `FabricEpochDay` uses TAG_EPOCH_DAY (dedicated primitive tag).
  // - `FabricHash` uses TAG_HASH (dedicated primitive tag).
  // - `FabricRegExp` uses TAG_REGEXP (dedicated primitive tag).
  // - `FabricKeyPair` uses TAG_KEY_PAIR (dedicated primitive tag), and only
  //   when it holds material; hashing one that holds handles throws.
  //
  // Examples (existing type tags are all short enough for the direct
  // string form, so `hashStr(tag)` below expands to
  // `TAG_STRING, leb128(utf8ByteLen), utf8Bytes`):
  // - `FabricError`:      hash(TAG_INSTANCE, hashStr("Error@1"), hashOf(errorState))
  // - `FabricMap`:        hash(TAG_INSTANCE, hashStr("Map@1"), hashOf(entries))
  //                         where entries are hashed in insertion order
  // - `FabricSet`:        hash(TAG_INSTANCE, hashStr("Set@1"), hashOf(elements))
  //                         where elements are hashed in insertion order
  // - `FabricEpochNsec`:  hash(TAG_EPOCH_NSEC, leb128(byteLen), twosComplementBytes)
  // - `FabricEpochDay`:   hash(TAG_EPOCH_DAY, leb128(byteLen), twosComplementBytes)
  // - `FabricHash`:  hash(TAG_HASH, hashStr(algTag), leb128(hashByteLen), hashBytes)
  // - `FabricBytes`:      hash(TAG_BYTES, leb128(byteLen), rawBytes)
  // - `FabricRegExp`:     hash(TAG_REGEXP, hashStr(source), hashStr(flags),
  //                               hashStr(flavor))
  // - `FabricKeyPair`:    hash(TAG_KEY_PAIR, hashStr(algorithm),
  //                               hashOf(publicKey), hashOf(privateKey))
  //
  // Each type is tagged to prevent collisions between types with
  // identical content representations. In particular, holes (TAG_HOLE),
  // `undefined` (TAG_UNDEFINED), and `null` (TAG_NULL) all produce
  // distinct hashes, ensuring `[1, , 3]`, `[1, undefined, 3]`, and
  // `[1, null, 3]` are distinguishable by hash.
  //
  // Note: The hash is a function of the logical value, not any
  // particular wire format. Implementations that hash from an
  // in-memory array and implementations that hash from the wire
  // format must produce identical hashes. Both use maximal-run RLE
  // for holes in the hash stream.
}

### 6.5 Relationship to Late Serialization

Hashing operates on `FabricValue` directly, using codec-encoded state for
`FabricInstance`s (including the native object wrappers; via `codecOf()`,
Section 2.4) and type-specific handling for primitives and containers.
This makes identity hashing independent of any particular wire encoding —
the same hash whether later serialized to JSON, CBOR, or Automerge.

### 6.6 Use Cases

Hashing is used for:
- Pattern ID generation (derived from pattern definition)
- Request deduplication
- Causal chain references (hashing the causal tree of what led to the data's
  existence)

Entity IDs remain stable addresses (analogous to IPNS names) pointing to the
most current version of the data. Hashes are not used as entity addresses.

### 6.7 Value Equality

`FabricValue`s are compared for logical (content) equality by
`valueEqual(a: FabricValue, b: FabricValue): boolean`. This is the equality
the reactive system's change-detection and no-op gates depend on, and the
equality that `Map` / `Set` key behavior over fabric values is expected to
follow.

**Governing principle.** Value-equality follows `Object.is()` at the primitive
level, and content-hash equality (Section 6.4) is defined to agree with it —
equivalently, two `FabricValue`s are value-equal exactly when their content
hashes are equal. `Object.is()`, not `===`, is the operator the contract
names, and the two disagree in exactly the two cases the hashing layer already
distinguishes:

- **`-0` ≠ `+0`.** `Object.is(-0, +0)` is `false`, so `-0` and `+0` are
  distinct fabric values and hash distinctly (Section 6.4;
  `2-hash-byte-format.md` Section 4.3). (`===` would conflate them, treating
  `-0 === +0` as `true`.)
- **All `NaN`s are value-equal.** `Object.is(NaN, NaN)` is `true`, so every
  `NaN` is value-equal to every other `NaN` — including bitwise-distinct
  payloads, which the hashing layer canonicalizes to a single quiet `NaN`
  (Section 6.4; `2-hash-byte-format.md` Section 4.3) — and all `NaN`s hash
  identically. (`===` would report `NaN !== NaN`.)

Every other primitive falls through to ordinary same-value equality:
`+Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and each finite number equals itself and nothing
else, and likewise for `string`, `boolean`, `bigint`, interned `symbol`,
`null`, and `undefined`.

**Objects, arrays, and instances.** Non-primitive fabric values are compared
by canonical content hash: `valueEqual(a, b)` holds exactly when
`hashStringOf(a) === hashStringOf(b)` (Section 6.4). Because the content hash
reflects logical content and carries the primitive-leaf distinctions above, a
`-0`, `NaN`, or any other value nested arbitrarily deep inside a plain object,
array, `FabricMap`, `FabricSet`, or other `FabricInstance` inherits the same
equality. Deciding object equality by content hash (rather than by a naive
property walk) is also what lets structurally distinct values be told apart —
a sparse array hole vs. a stored `undefined`, a present `undefined` vs. an
absent key (Section 6.4), and two distinct `FabricInstance`s of the same class
that carry no enumerable own-properties.

## 7. Implementation Guidance

### 7.1 Adopting Late Serialization

Migration to the spec involves replacing early JSON-form conversion with
boundary-only encoding and the three-layer architecture:

1. Update `FabricValue` to exclude raw native JS types, include
   `FabricInstance` (Section 1.2).
2. Introduce the native object wrapper classes (`FabricError`, etc.) that
   implement `FabricInstance` (Section 1.4).
3. Rework `shallowFabricFromNativeValue()` / `fabricFromNativeValue()` to
   wrap native types into `FabricInstance` wrappers and return frozen results
   (Section 8).
4. Add `nativeFromFabricValue()` for unwrapping back to native types
   (Section 8).
5. Remove early conversion points (e.g., `convertCellsToLinks()`,
   legacy `Error` wrapping as `{ "@Error": ... }`).
6. Introduce a codec engine at each boundary (Section 4.7).
7. Update internal code to work with `FabricValue` types rather than JSON
   shapes or raw native objects.

> **`toJSON()` is not a conversion route.** The conversion functions give a
> `toJSON()` method no standing: a value that is not a `FabricValue`, a
> `FabricNativeObject`, or an accepted container does not become representable
> by carrying one. An object bearing `toJSON` is read as the record it is, so
> the method itself is an ordinary member — a function, which no record may
> hold. Anything that needs a representation of its own implements the fabric
> protocol (`FabricInstance` + `[CODEC]`); anything that a caller wants
> encoded on its way in is that caller's to encode before it reaches the
> conversion. Honoring `toJSON()` would eagerly convert to JSON-compatible
> shapes, which is incompatible with late serialization.

### 7.2 Unifying JSON Encoding

**The JSON layering defined by `codec-json` is to be the only JSON layering the
system defines. This is settled.** It is the direction the system is committed
to, not one option among several: a value's JSON form is the
`/<Type>@<Version>` tagged-object convention of `3-json-encoding.md`, and no
other layer defines a competing one.

**It is not yet the whole truth of the system, and this section says so
deliberately.** Conventions predating that decision still appear on the wire,
and they are being retired rather than accommodated. The distinction matters for
anyone reading this to decide something: treat the unified encoding as the
target to build toward and to write new code against, and treat what follows as
the remaining distance, not as a menu.

`codec-json` already holds up its end: **neither convention below is an encoding
it defines**, so the work is not to teach the JSON layer about alternative
encodings, but to retire the conventions where they are produced and recognized,
in the layers above it. The two get there by different routes, and the
difference matters to anyone tracing a value through the wire format.

- **`$stream` is an ordinary key.** The JSON layer attaches no meaning to it: a
  record carrying it round-trips as the record it is.
- **The link-ref envelope is not.** `/` is reserved — the prefix is wholly owned
  by the encoding system in the wire format (Section 9 of `3-json-encoding.md`),
  so a `/`-keyed record reaching the wire is a tagged value, a built-in escape,
  or an encoding error, never a literal user key. A literal one reaches the wire
  only by being wrapped in an escape first — `/object` where its values should
  still be interpreted, `/quote` where the whole subtree is to be taken
  literally (Section 6 of the same document).

That the envelope needs escaping is the stronger statement of the two. It is not
a rival encoding the JSON layer tolerates alongside its own; it is user data the
layer has to work around, and it can only reach the wire intact by being hidden
from the very rule that gives `/` its meaning.

**What remains:**

| Convention | Where Produced and Recognized | Example | Unified Form |
|------------|-------------------------------|---------|--------------|
| Link-ref envelope | Links (`runner/src/sigil-types.ts`, chokepointed on `data-model/cell-rep`) | `{ "/": { "link@1": { id, path, space } } }` | `{ "/Link@1": { id, path, space } }` |
| `$stream` marker | Streams (`runner/src/builder/types.ts`) | `{ "$stream": true }` | `{ "/Stream@1": null }` |

> **Note on `$stream`:** `$stream` is a stateless marker — it signals that a
> cell path is a stream endpoint rather than carrying decodable state.
> Under the unified encoding it becomes `{ "/Stream@1": null }` (a stateless
> tagged type per Section 5 of `3-json-encoding.md`), preserving its marker
> semantics.

> **The link-ref envelope has a named owner.** `sigil-types.ts` states that the
> envelope and its tag belong to `data-model/cell-rep`, the chokepoint that
> dispatches the form — and the envelope's occurrences are concentrated there
> rather than scattered across the tree. The unification therefore has a place
> to happen rather than a search to perform first, which is a large part of why
> the direction is settled and not merely intended.

### 7.3 Replacing CID-Based Hashing

The hashing approach (Section 6) replaces `merkle-reference` / CID-based
hashing. Since the system does not participate in the IPFS network, CID
formatting adds overhead without interoperability benefit. The hash operates
on the logical data structure directly.

### 7.4 Untrusted Decoded Input

**Decoded values must not be trusted for type safety.** After
encoding and decoding, a value may not conform to the TypeScript
type that code assumes — the wire format carries no type guarantees, and a
round-trip through JSON (or any other encoding) can silently produce values
whose runtime shape does not match their static type.

This applies at every point where decoded data is consumed:

- **Codec implementations** (Section 2.4) are handed a state whose internal
  structure is whatever was on the wire. Checking it at run time — property
  existence, types, constraints — is the codec's obligation, and a type cast
  (`state as { value: number }`) discharges none of it. What a codec is spared
  is checking twice: `canDecode()` holds the cheap part, stated as a type
  predicate over the codec's own state type, and the engine asking it of every
  state before dispatch is what makes the narrower `state` parameter `decode()`
  declares true rather than asserted. `decode()` keeps the checks whose only
  implementation is the decoding itself.
  See the note in Section 2.7 for a concrete example.

- **JSON-side codec decoding** (Section 3 of `3-json-encoding.md`) must
  validate the format of its state before processing. Malformed input must
  be rejected rather than silently producing garbage; a codec rejects by
  refusing the state in `canDecode()`, or from `decode()` by throwing or by
  returning a `ProblematicValue`, and the engine settles all three against its
  `lenient` setting (Section 4.5).

- **Hashing** (Section 6.3) may operate on values that have been
  through a decoding round-trip. Code that extracts properties from
  `FabricInstance` values must validate those properties at runtime.

- **Application code** that reads values from cells, IPC messages, or any other
  boundary listed in Section 4.7 should treat the values as untrusted until
  validated.

The general principle: a type cast (`as T`) is a compile-time assertion with no
runtime effect. After an encoding boundary, the only reliable way to
confirm a value's shape is runtime checking.

## 8. Conversion Functions

### 8.1 Overview

The conversion functions bridge the left layer (JS wild west) and the middle
layer (`FabricValue`). They form the boundary between arbitrary JavaScript
values and the strongly typed data model.

There are two directions:

- **JS wild west -> `FabricValue`:** `shallowFabricFromNativeValue()`
  (shallow) and `fabricFromNativeValue()` (deep, recursive).
- **`FabricValue` -> JS wild west:** `nativeFromFabricValue()` (deep,
  recursive).

### 8.2 `shallowFabricFromNativeValue()` and `fabricFromNativeValue()`

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/native-conversion.ts

/**
 * Convert a value to `FabricValue` without recursing into nested values.
 * Wraps native JS types (`Error`, `Date`, `RegExp`, `Uint8Array`) into
 * their `FabricInstance` or `FabricPrimitive` wrapper classes. If the value
 * is already a valid `FabricValue`, returns it as-is.
 *
 * The input type is `unknown` — the function accepts any JavaScript value.
 * Unsupported types cause a thrown error.
 *
 * **Freeze semantics (shallow):** By default, the returned value is frozen
 * at the top level via `Object.freeze()`. Nested values are NOT recursively
 * frozen. The caller's input is never mutated — if the top-level value is
 * an unfrozen array or object, a shallow copy is made before freezing. If
 * the input is already a frozen `FabricValue`, returns the same object.
 * Pass `freeze: false` to skip freezing (see below).
 */
export function shallowFabricFromNativeValue(
  value: unknown,
  freeze?: boolean, // default: true
): FabricValueLayer;

/**
 * Convert a value to `FabricValue`, recursively processing nested values
 * (deep conversion). This is the primary conversion entry point.
 *
 * - Recursively descends into arrays and plain objects.
 * - Wraps native JS objects at any depth.
 * - **Single-pass design:** Validation, wrapping, and freezing are performed
 *   together in one recursive descent — there are no separate passes. Each
 *   node is checked, wrapped if needed, and frozen before the function
 *   returns from that level.
 * - **No caller mutation:** The caller's input objects are never frozen or
 *   modified in place. When freezing is needed, shallow copies are made
 *   first. If the input is already a deeply-frozen `FabricValue`, returns
 *   the same object (no copying needed).
 * - Detects circular references and throws.
 * - Throws on unsupported types at any depth.
 *
 * Pass `freeze: false` to perform wrapping and validation without freezing
 * (see "Freeze Semantics" below).
 */
export function fabricFromNativeValue(
  value: unknown,
  freeze?: boolean, // default: true
): FabricValue;
```

#### Conversion Rules

| Input Type | Output |
|------------|--------|
| `null`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `undefined`, `bigint` | Returned as-is (primitives are `FabricValue` directly). All numbers pass through unchanged, including `-0`, `NaN`, and `±Infinity`. See Section 1.3 callout for layer-by-layer details. |
| `symbol` | Registry-interned symbols (`Symbol.keyFor(s)` returns a string) returned as-is; unique symbols (`Symbol(desc)`) throw with the message ``"Not representable as a `FabricValue`: unique (uninterned) symbol"``. See Section 1.3 callout for layer-by-layer details. |
| `FabricPrimitive` (`FabricEpochNsec`, `FabricEpochDay`, `FabricHash`, `FabricBytes`) | Returned as-is. Always-frozen: the `freeze` option has no effect on these types (see Section 1.4.6). |
| `FabricInstance` (including wrapper classes) | Returned as-is (already `FabricValue`). |
| `Error` | Wrapped into `FabricError`. Before wrapping, `cause` and custom enumerable properties are recursively converted to `FabricValue` (deep variant) or left as-is (shallow variant). Extra enumerable properties are preserved (see Section 1.4.1). This ensures that by the time the `FabricError` codec's `encode()` runs, all nested values are already valid `FabricValue`. |
| `Map` | Wrapped into `FabricMap`. Keys and values are recursively converted (deep variant only). Extra enumerable properties on the `Map` object cause **rejection** (throw) — it is better to fail loudly than silently lose data. |
| `Set` | Wrapped into `FabricSet`. Elements are recursively converted (deep variant only). Extra enumerable properties on the `Set` object cause **rejection** (throw) — it is better to fail loudly than silently lose data. |
| `Date` | Wrapped into `FabricEpochNsec`. The `Date`'s millisecond timestamp is converted to nanoseconds: `BigInt(date.getTime()) * 1_000_000n`. Note the millisecond precision limitation — sub-millisecond information is not available from `Date`. Extra enumerable properties on the `Date` object cause **rejection** (throw) — it is better to fail loudly than silently lose data. |
| `RegExp` | Converted into `FabricRegExp` (a `FabricPrimitive`, not a wrapper). The `source` and `flags` are extracted from the native `RegExp`; `flavor` defaults to `"es2025"` (it is a `FabricRegExp`-level property, not a native `RegExp` property). Extra enumerable properties on the `RegExp` object cause **rejection** (throw) — it is better to fail loudly than silently lose data. |
| `Uint8Array` | Wrapped into `FabricBytes`. The input bytes are copied (the caller may mutate the original afterward). Extra enumerable properties on the `Uint8Array` object cause **rejection** (throw) — it is better to fail loudly than silently lose data. |
| `FabricValue[]` | Shallow: returned as-is (frozen if `freeze` is true). Deep: elements recursively converted (frozen at each level if `freeze` is true). |
| `{ [key: string]: FabricValue }` | Shallow: returned as-is (frozen if `freeze` is true). Deep: values recursively converted (frozen at each level if `freeze` is true). |

> **Implementation: tag-based type dispatch.** The conversion functions use a
> tag-based dispatch mechanism (`tagFromNativeValue()` in
> `packages/data-model/native-type-tags.ts`) to classify values in O(1) via a `switch` on
> the value's constructor. This replaces sequential `instanceof` chains with a

> `"Date"`, `"RegExp"`, `"Array"`, `"Object"`, `"Primitive"`,

#### Freeze Semantics

The immutable-forward design requires that `FabricValue` trees produced by
conversion are frozen **by default**:

- **`shallowFabricFromNativeValue()` (shallow):** `Object.freeze()` on the
  top-level result.
- **`fabricFromNativeValue()` (deep):** `Object.freeze()` at every level of
  nesting, performed in the **same recursive pass** as validation and wrapping.
  There are no separate passes — each node is checked, wrapped, and frozen
  before the recursion returns from that level.

**Caller arguments are never mutated.** The conversion functions must not call
`Object.freeze()` on the caller's input objects. When `freeze` is `true` and
the input is an unfrozen array or plain object, the function creates a shallow
copy and freezes the copy. This ensures that callers can safely pass mutable
data structures without side effects — the caller's objects remain mutable
after the call returns. (Wrapper objects like `FabricError` are freshly
constructed by the conversion function, so freezing them is not a mutation of
caller state.)

**`deepFreeze` at schema merge/combine sites.** The `deepFreeze()` utility
(in `packages/data-model/deep-freeze.ts`) recursively freezes an object tree in
place; see Section 8.6 for its full protocol, dispatch shape, and the
boundary-crossing egress contracts. At sites where schema objects are
merged or combined (e.g., schema `merge()` and `combine()` functions),
pass-through paths — where the input is returned as the result without
structural modification — must copy the value before freezing to avoid
mutating caller-owned schema objects. The general principle: `deepFreeze()`
freezes in place, so if the caller retains a reference to a mutable
object, the function must not freeze that object as a side effect. Callers
at these sites should copy before freezing rather than relying on the
input being "safe to freeze."

**Always-frozen types bypass the `freeze` option.** JS primitives (`null`,
`boolean`, `number`, `string`, `undefined`, `bigint`) are inherently immutable
and pass through unchanged regardless of the `freeze` setting.
`FabricPrimitive` instances (`FabricEpochNsec`, `FabricEpochDay`,
`FabricHash`, `FabricBytes`) are treated the same way — they are always returned as-is,
never copied or modified by the freeze/thaw logic. Their state is immutable by
construction (readonly fields, no mutation methods), so `Object.freeze()` is
unnecessary and thawing is meaningless. See Section 1.4.6.

If the input is already frozen (or deep-frozen for the deep variant), the same
object is returned — no defensive copying. This avoids unnecessary allocation
in the common case where values are already immutable.

The freeze check starts with a naive recursive `Object.isFrozen()` walk. This
is sufficient for correctness; optimization (e.g., a `WeakSet<object>` of known
deep-frozen objects) can be added later if profiling shows a need.

#### Optional `freeze` Parameter

All conversion functions accept an optional `freeze` parameter (default:
`true`). When `freeze` is `false`, the function performs validation and wrapping
but skips freezing:

```typescript
// Shown inside a pattern body.
// Frozen (default) -- immutable result, safe for sharing.
const frozen = fabricFromNativeValue(input);

// Unfrozen -- mutable result, caller can modify before freezing later.
const mutable = fabricFromNativeValue(input, false);
```

This exists because JavaScript makes it difficult to update frozen values —
there is no "thaw" operation. Callers that need to build up a `FabricValue`
tree incrementally (e.g., merging data from multiple sources) can use
`freeze: false` to get a mutable tree, then freeze it when construction is
complete. The `freeze` parameter does not affect validation or wrapping — the
returned value is always a valid `FabricValue` regardless of its frozen state.

### 8.3 `isValidFabricConvertibleValue()`

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/native-conversion.ts

/**
 * Type predicate: returns `true` if `fabricFromNativeValue()` would succeed
 * on the given value — i.e., the value is a `FabricValue`, a
 * `FabricNativeObject`, or a tree of these types. That is exactly what
 * `FabricConvertibleValue` names (Section 1.2), so callers can use
 * `isValidFabricConvertibleValue(x)` as a type guard in conditionals.
 *
 * This is a check-without-conversion function for system boundaries where
 * code receives `unknown` and needs to determine convertibility without
 * actually performing the conversion (and its associated wrapping, freezing,
 * and allocation).
 *
 * Relationship to other functions and checks:
 * - `isValidFabricValue(x)` (in `type-check.ts`): the narrower check — "is `x`
 *   already a `FabricValue`?" — which does NOT accept raw native types like
 *   `Error` or `Map`.
 * - `isValidFabricConvertibleValue(x)`: "Could `x` be converted to a
 *   `FabricValue` via `fabricFromNativeValue()`?" Returns `true` for both
 *   `FabricValue` values AND `FabricNativeObject` values (and deep trees
 *   thereof).
 * - `fabricFromNativeValue(x)`: Actually performs the conversion,
 *   throwing on unsupported types.
 */
export function isValidFabricConvertibleValue(
  value: unknown,
): value is FabricConvertibleValue;
```

The function recursively checks the value tree. It returns `true` if and only
if the value is:

- A primitive (`null`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `undefined`, `bigint`).
  All numbers are accepted, including `-0`, `NaN`, and `±Infinity`; see the
  Section 1.3 callout.
- A registry-interned `symbol` (one for which `Symbol.keyFor(s)` returns a
  string). Unique symbols return `false`; see the Section 1.3 callout.
- A `FabricInstance` (including the native object wrapper classes)
- A `FabricNativeObject` (`Error`, `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, `RegExp`,
  `Uint8Array`)
- An array where every present element satisfies
  `isValidFabricConvertibleValue()`, and
  which the array rule of Section 1.5 accepts
- A plain object where every value satisfies `isValidFabricConvertibleValue()`

It returns `false` for unsupported types (`WeakMap`, `Promise`, DOM nodes,
class instances that don't implement `FabricInstance`, etc.) and for unique
symbols.

> **Performance note.** `isValidFabricConvertibleValue()` walks the value tree
> without allocating wrappers or frozen copies. For large trees, this is cheaper
> than calling `fabricFromNativeValue()` inside a try/catch, since it avoids the
> wrapping and freezing work that would be discarded on failure. However, if the
> caller intends to convert on success, calling `fabricFromNativeValue()`
> directly (and catching the error) avoids walking the tree twice.

### 8.4 `nativeFromFabricValue()`

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// file: packages/data-model/native-conversion.ts

/**
 * Deep unwrap: recursively walk a `FabricValue` tree, unwrapping any
 * `FabricNativeWrapper` values to their underlying native types via
 * `toNativeValue()`. Non-native `FabricInstance` values (`Cell`, `Stream`,
 * `UnknownValue`, `ProblematicValue`, etc.) pass through unchanged.
 *
 * Wrapper classes are unwrapped to their native equivalents:
 *
 * - `FabricError`      -> `Error` (with cause and custom properties
 *                         recursively unwrapped)
 * - `FabricMap`        -> `FrozenMap` / `Map`
 * - `FabricSet`        -> `FrozenSet` / `Set`
 *
 * `FabricPrimitive` subclasses (`FabricEpochNsec`, `FabricEpochDay`,
 * `FabricHash`, `FabricBytes`, `FabricRegExp`) pass through unchanged — they
 * are always-frozen (Section 1.4.6). (`FabricRegExp` exposes its native form
 * via `value`, which returns a fresh `RegExp` clone; it is not unwrapped to a
 * native `RegExp` by this function.)
 *
 * **The `frozen` argument is always honored.** The freeze state of every
 * value in the output matches the `frozen` argument. When `frozen` is
 * `true` (the default), unwrapped wrappers use immutable variants
 * (`FrozenMap`, `FrozenSet`, frozen `Error`). When `frozen` is `false`,
 * mutable native types are returned instead.
 */
export function nativeFromFabricValue(
  value: FabricValue,
  frozen?: boolean, // default: true
): FabricConvertibleValue;
```

#### Unwrapping Rules

| Input | Output (frozen) | Output (not frozen) |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `FabricError` | `Error` (original if already frozen; frozen copy otherwise) | `Error` (original if already unfrozen; mutable copy otherwise) |
| `FabricMap` | `FrozenMap` (original if already `FrozenMap`; new wrapper otherwise) | `Map` (original if already plain `Map`; mutable copy otherwise) |
| `FabricSet` | `FrozenSet` (original if already `FrozenSet`; new wrapper otherwise) | `Set` (original if already plain `Set`; mutable copy otherwise) |
| `FabricEpochNsec` | Passed through unchanged (`FabricPrimitive`; always-frozen) | Passed through unchanged (same) |
| `FabricEpochDay` | Passed through unchanged (`FabricPrimitive`; always-frozen) | Passed through unchanged (same) |
| `FabricHash` | Passed through unchanged (always-frozen; Section 1.4.6) | Passed through unchanged (same) |
| `FabricBytes` | Passed through unchanged (always-frozen; Section 1.4.6) | Passed through unchanged (same) |
| `FabricRegExp` | Passed through unchanged (`FabricPrimitive`; always-frozen) | Passed through unchanged (same) |
| Other `FabricInstance` | Passed through unchanged | Passed through unchanged |
| Primitives | Passed through unchanged | Passed through unchanged |
| Arrays | Recursively unwrapped; output frozen | Recursively unwrapped; output NOT frozen |
| Plain objects | Recursively unwrapped; output frozen | Recursively unwrapped; output NOT frozen |

The output type is `FabricConvertibleValue` (Section 1.2), reflecting
that the result may contain native JS types at any depth — a container of them
is neither a `FabricValue` nor a `FabricNativeObject`, so the recursive type is
what names it.

> **Implementation: `FabricNativeWrapper` dispatch.** The unwrapping
> functions use a single `instanceof FabricNativeWrapper` check to identify
> all native object wrappers, then delegate to `toNativeValue(frozen)` on the
> base class. This replaces the previous pattern of per-wrapper `instanceof`
> cascades (`instanceof FabricError`, `instanceof FabricMap`, etc.) with
> a single branch. The `toNativeValue()` method (defined on
> `FabricNativeWrapper`, Section 1.4.1) handles the freeze-state check and
> delegates to the subclass's `toNativeFrozen()` or `toNativeThawed()` when a
> state change is needed.

**The `frozen` parameter is always honored.** The freeze state of every value in
the output tree matches the `frozen` argument. Specifically:

- If `frozen` is `true` and the value's freeze state already matches, the
  original reference is returned as-is.
- If `frozen` is `true` and the value is unfrozen, a new frozen variant is
  constructed (e.g., wrapping a `Map` in `FrozenMap`).
- If `frozen` is `false` and the value is frozen, a new unfrozen (mutable) copy
  is returned.
- If `frozen` is `false` and the value is already unfrozen, the original
  reference is returned as-is (or a copy is returned if structural changes are
  needed, e.g., unwrapping children in the deep variant).

This applies uniformly to all output values — arrays, plain objects, `Error`s,
and all wrapper-derived native types. Primitives are inherently immutable and
need no freeze/thaw action. A new object is constructed only when the freeze
state differs between the stored value and the requested output.

**Recurses into `FabricError` internals.** The function recurses into
`FabricError` internals —
specifically, the `cause` chain and custom enumerable properties — unwrapping any
nested `FabricInstance` values. This ensures the output is fully "native JS"
with no fabric wrappers at any depth. Without this recursion, an Error's
`cause` could still contain `FabricInstance` wrappers (e.g., a nested
`FabricError`).

> **Why `FrozenMap` / `FrozenSet`?** `Object.freeze()` does not prevent
> mutation of `Map` and `Set` — their `set()`, `delete()`, `add()`, and
> `clear()` methods remain callable on a frozen instance. `FrozenMap` and
> `FrozenSet` are thin wrappers that expose the read-only subset of the
> `Map`/`Set` API (`get`, `has`, `entries`, `forEach`, `size`, etc.) and throw
> on any mutation attempt. This ensures that data round-tripped through the
> fabric layer remains effectively immutable even after unwrapping. The exact
> API of `FrozenMap` and `FrozenSet` is an implementation decision.

> **Why `FabricPrimitive` subclasses pass through unchanged.**
> `FabricEpochNsec`, `FabricEpochDay`, `FabricHash`, and `FabricBytes` are
> all `FabricPrimitive` subclasses — always frozen at construction time with
> no mutable state. They have no native equivalent to unwrap to (unlike
> `FabricError` → `Error` or `FabricMap` → `Map`), so the unwrap function
> returns them as-is.

> **Why `FabricBytes` copies its input.** `FabricBytes` is a
> `FabricPrimitive` — always frozen at construction time with its bytes
> defensively copied. `FabricBytes` has no native equivalent to unwrap to,
> so it is the byte representation rather than a wrapper around one. Callers
> who need raw bytes use `slice()` or `copyInto()` on the instance
> directly.

### 8.5 Round-Trip Guarantees

For any supported value `v`:

```
nativeFromFabricValue(fabricFromNativeValue(v))
```

produces a value that is structurally equivalent to `v` — the same data at the
same positions. The round-tripped value may or may not be `===` to the original:
when the freeze state already matches, wrappers return their internal reference
directly; when it differs, a new object is constructed. The **freeze state of
the output always matches the `frozen` argument**: when `frozen` is `true` (the
default), the output tree is fully frozen — arrays and plain objects are frozen
via `Object.freeze()`, a mutable `Map` becomes a `FrozenMap`, a mutable `Set`
becomes a `FrozenSet`, temporal wrappers unwrap to their bigint values,
`FabricHash` and `FabricBytes` pass through unchanged, and `Error`s are
frozen. When `frozen` is `false`, the output tree is
fully mutable. The data content is preserved; the mutability matches the `frozen`
argument.

Similarly, for any `FabricValue` `sv`:

```
fabricFromNativeValue(nativeFromFabricValue(sv))
```

produces a `FabricValue` that is structurally equivalent to `sv`.

### 8.6 Deep-Freeze Protocol and Egress Contracts

`FabricValue` trees produced by decoding at boundary-crossings are
deep-frozen by default. This is enforced via a small protocol on
`BaseFabricInstance` together with a generic top-level utility that dispatches
across the four kinds of values that can appear in a `FabricValue` tree.

#### Instance protocol members

Every concrete `FabricInstance` provides the three members below
(Section 2.3). Their declarations are split by concern: the freeze-protocol
members `[DEEP_FREEZE]` and `[IS_DEEP_FROZEN]` are declared on
`BaseFabricInstance` — the abstract base that concrete instance classes extend
— keeping this implementation plumbing off the pure-protocol `FabricInstance`
interface, while `deepClone()` and the inherited `shallowClone()` are declared
on `FabricInstance` itself. These members, plus the class-side `[CODEC]`
(encoding; Section 2.4), are the whole instance protocol:

- **`[DEEP_FREEZE](subFreeze)`** — Deeply freezes this instance in place
  and returns it. The implementation freezes the instance's own internal
  slot(s) and calls the provided `subFreeze` callback on each nested
  `FabricValue`. Implementations must NOT call `deepFreeze()` directly:
  recursion is handed through the callback so that the freeze utility's
  caching and cycle-detection bookkeeping is preserved and no import cycle
  is introduced.

- **`[IS_DEEP_FROZEN](subIsDeepFrozen)`** — Side-effect-free sibling of
  `[DEEP_FREEZE]`: returns `true` if this instance's own internal slot(s)
  are in canonical deep-frozen form and every nested `FabricValue`
  (visited via the `subIsDeepFrozen` callback) is also deep-frozen.
  An instance that is not in canonical deep-frozen form returns `false`;
  the check must not throw.

- **`deepClone(frozen)`** — Returns a new deep clone of this instance with
  equivalent data but no shared structure for any unfrozen data in the
  original. When `frozen === true`, produces a frozen instance with
  maximal structural sharing (including returning `this` if already
  deep-frozen). When `frozen === false`, produces a deeply-mutable
  instance with no visible shared reference structure with the original.

The `subFreeze` / `subIsDeepFrozen` callbacks (rather than direct utility
imports) keep the protocol layering clean and let the outer utility thread
its shared cycle-detection state through implementations transparently.

#### `deepFreeze()` and the 4-arm dispatch

The generic top-level utility (`packages/data-model/deep-freeze.ts`)
recursively freezes a `FabricValue` in place. It dispatches on four arms
in order:

1. **Necessarily- or already-known-deep-frozen value** — primitives
   (`null` and `typeof !== "object"`) and objects already recorded in the
   internal deep-frozen cache. Short-circuits unchanged.

2. **`FabricPrimitive` instance** — `FabricPrimitive` subclasses
   (`FabricEpochNsec`, `FabricEpochDay`, `FabricHash`, `FabricBytes`;
   Section 1.4.6) self-freeze at construction and have no outbound
   references. Short-circuits unchanged.

3. **`FabricInstance`** — Delegates to the instance's `[DEEP_FREEZE]`
   member with a `subFreeze` callback that recurses back through the same
   utility, threading the shared cycle-detection state. The dispatch
   gates on `instanceof` against the abstract base; it does not enumerate
   concrete subclasses. The (now deep-frozen) result is recorded in the
   deep-frozen cache so subsequent `isDeepFrozen()` checks short-circuit
   in O(1).

4. **Plain object or array** — Recurses into children, then freezes the
   container with `Object.freeze()`. Arrays preserve sparse holes. The
   container is recorded in the deep-frozen cache.

A shared `inProgress` set, threaded through all recursive calls (including
into participating `FabricInstance`s' `[DEEP_FREEZE]` impls via the
`subFreeze` callback closure), makes the utility cycle-safe: a cycle back
to a value the outer call is already deep-freezing short-circuits rather
than recursing.

#### `isValidDeepFrozenFabricValue()` and the 4-arm type guard

The type guard (`isValidDeepFrozenFabricValue`) is the side-effect-free sibling
of `deepFreeze()`. It mirrors the same arm shape:

1. Primitives are accepted directly.
2. `FabricPrimitive` instances are accepted directly.
3. `FabricInstance` instances delegate to their `[IS_DEEP_FROZEN]` member
   with a `subIsDeepFrozen` callback that recurses back through the same
   guard.
4. Plain objects and arrays must be `Object.isFrozen` and have every
   child accepted by the guard.

Visited objects are tracked in a per-call `Set` for cycle safety.

#### Egress-freezing call sites

The deep-freeze contract is enforced at the points where decoded
values cross from internal codec machinery to callers:

- **Every value the decode walker returns is deep-frozen at the boundary**,
  whichever arm produced it. The arms reach that by two routes. A leaf arm
  calls `deepFreeze()`: the codec-produced value (often a `FabricPrimitive`
  subclass, already frozen — the cache hit makes this O(1)), the lenient-mode
  `ProblematicValue` fallback, and the unknown-tag arm's `UnknownValue`. A
  container arm calls `Object.freeze()` on the array or object it has just
  built, whose children the leaf arms have already deep-frozen, so the
  guarantee holds without walking them a second time. Which arm produced a
  value is therefore not something a caller has to know. See Section 4.5
  step 4.

- **`ProblematicStateError.asProblematicValue()`.** The rendering of a thrown
  refusal as a returned value is deep-frozen where it is built, rather than at
  each call site, so a caller reaching it outside the walker gets the same
  guarantee.

- **`JsonCodecValue` parse boundary.** The `parseWireText()` helper
  (invoked by `decode()`) deep-freezes the parsed tree
  before handing it to the decode walker. This is what makes the
  decode-side `JsonCodecValue` invariant load-bearing: tag-unwrap and
  the `/quote` arm can hand back extracted sub-trees directly without
  further copying because the input tree is already deep-frozen.

- **Codec `decode()` implementations honoring `shouldDeepFreeze`.** When a
  decode call's `LiveEnvironment.shouldDeepFreeze` is
  `true` (Section 2.5; the safe default), each codec `decode()`
  implementation produces a deep-frozen result (typically via the
  instance's own `[DEEP_FREEZE]`, recursing through `deepFreeze()`).

- **`deepFreeze()` at schema merge/combine sites.** See Section 8.2.

## Appendix A: Open Design Decisions

These questions may need resolution during implementation but do not block the
spec from being implementable.

- **Type registry management**: How are codec engines configured? Static
  registration? Dynamic discovery? Who owns the registry? The isolation
  strategy (see `coordination/docs/2026-02-09-isolation-strategy.md`) proposes
  per-`Runtime` configuration via `ExperimentalOptions`, which provides a
  natural place for registry configuration per runtime instance.

- **Schema integration**: Each `FabricInstance` type implies a schema for its
  encoded state. How does this integrate with the schema language?
  Currently out of scope (schemas are listed as out-of-scope for this spec).

- **Exact hash specification**: The precise byte-level format is defined in
  `2-hash-byte-format.md`. All lengths and counts use unsigned LEB128
  encoding; see that document for the complete specification of type tags,
  encoding per type, and illustrative examples.

- **Migration path**: Out of scope for this spec. The detailed migration plan
  (sequencing of flag introductions, criteria for graduating each flag to
  default-on) will be addressed in a separate document.

- **`LiveEnvironment` extensibility**: The minimal interface defined in
  Section 2.5 covers `Cell` decoding. Other future fabric types may
  need additional environment methods. Should the interface be extended, or should
  types cast to a broader interface? Recommendation: extend the interface as
  needed; the indirection through an interface (rather than depending on
  `Runtime` directly) makes this straightforward.

- **`getRaw()` / `setRaw()` middle-layer contract**: Emerging consensus is
  that `Cell.getRaw()` and `Cell.setRaw()` should traffic in `FabricValue`
  (middle layer), not arbitrary native JS values (wild west). A usage survey
  of all call sites in the codebase found that every existing caller operates
  on well-defined fabric data (plain objects, arrays, strings, links, stream
  markers) — no call site stores or retrieves raw native types like `Error`,
  `Date`, `RegExp`, `Map`, `Set`, or `Uint8Array` through these methods.
  Formalizing this contract (e.g., refining the type parameter `T` of
  `IAnyCell` to `extends FabricValue`) would make the implicit expectation
  explicit without breaking any current caller. The `nativeFromFabricValue()` /
  `fabricFromNativeValue()` conversion in these methods (Section 4.9) is correct
  but forward-looking: it will become load-bearing when user-facing patterns
  start storing rich types through the schema-aware `set()` path.
