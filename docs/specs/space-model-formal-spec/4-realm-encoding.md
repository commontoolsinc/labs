# Realm-Crossing Encoding for Fabric Values

This document specifies the wire format used to carry fabric values between
realms over a structured-clone transport — `structuredClone()` and
`postMessage()` — including the outer envelope and its marker, the tagged
form, per-type encodings, the ownership contract on decode, and what the
format refuses.

## Status

Draft formal spec — the realm-crossing counterpart to
[3-json-encoding.md](./3-json-encoding.md).

---

## 1. Overview

This format exists for one boundary: worker IPC, where a value is constructed,
handed to a transport that clones it, decoded on the far side, and discarded.
It is not a storage format and has no persistence story. A value written down
for later, or read by something that did not receive it directly, uses the JSON
encoding.

The two formats divide along what their transports carry. JSON reaches a
`string`, so every type JavaScript has and JSON lacks — `bigint`, `undefined`,
the special numbers, bytes — is written out as tagged text, and a `/`-prefixed
key in user data has to be escaped clear of the tags. Structured cloning
carries all of those but `symbol`, and carries them with their types intact, so
most of a value passes through untouched and tagging is reserved for what
genuinely needs it.

Tagging is not the same question as what the transport can carry, and the two
should not be conflated. A `FabricRegExp` is tagged here even though cloning
carries a native `RegExp` perfectly well, because it is a class instance and
reconstructing one is a codec's job under any format.

### 1.1 Transport Requirements

A transport carrying this format must:

1. **Preserve the types this format emits**: `null`, `undefined`, `boolean`,
   `number` (including `-0`, `NaN` and `±Infinity`), `bigint`, `string`,
   `ArrayBuffer`, arrays, and plain objects.
2. **Preserve a sparse array's length and its absent indices**, so that a hole
   crosses as a hole (Section 3.2).
3. **Preserve object reference identity, in both directions.** One object
   referenced from many positions must arrive as one object referenced from
   many positions; and two distinct objects must arrive distinct, however
   equal they look.

The third is load-bearing rather than incidental: Section 2 rests on it
entirely, and on *both* of its halves. A transport that deep-copied naively,
reproducing each reference as a fresh object, would leave a decoder unable to
recognize any tagged form. A transport that interned or deduplicated equal
subtrees would do the opposite and worse: a payload's own array that happened
to equal the marker would be merged with it, and that data would decode as a
tagged form.

**Both failures are silent.** Neither produces a refusal — the first decodes
every tagged form as a plain three-element array, and the second decodes
ordinary data as a tagged value. A transport is therefore something to verify
against this contract before use, not something to try and see.

The structured clone algorithm provides all three.

## 2. The Outer Envelope and the Marker

An encoded value is a two-element array:

```
[marker, tree]
```

`marker` is an object created by the encoder, and `tree` is the walked value.
The same `marker` object appears at slot zero of every tagged form within
`tree` (Section 3).

### 2.1 Detection

A decoder takes the marker from slot zero of the outer envelope and recognizes
every tagged form beneath it by **object identity** — `===` against that
object. Nothing about a tagged form's *shape* distinguishes it from an array the
payload built for itself, and nothing is meant to: an encoded tree contains
ordinary arrays and ordinary objects, and identity alone separates the
encoder's from the payload's.

This is what lets the format do without escaping entirely, where JSON needs
`/quote`, `/object`, and a reserved-key rule (`3-json-encoding.md` Sections 6
and 9). There is no reserved key, no reserved shape, and no user data that
needs rewriting before it reaches the wire.

### 2.2 The Marker

The marker **must be an object**. Identity comparison on a primitive is value
equality, so a primitive marker would be reproducible by any payload holding
the same one, and would mark nothing.

The marker **must be minted per encode call**, and **the encoder must not
retain or reuse one**. It outlives the call inside the outer envelope, which is
the point; what it must not do is survive *in the encoder*, available to a
later call. Two facts together are what make both forms unforgeable from within
a payload:

- It is **younger than the value**. It is created after the value exists, so
  nothing already assembled can hold a reference to it — whatever its author
  has seen of some earlier encoding.
- It is **confined**. It never leaves the encoder until the call returns,
  living only in encoder-private state and in the tagged forms the walk is
  building. Age alone would not settle it, because a value's contents need not
  all exist when the walk starts: a getter runs mid-walk, after the marker
  exists. What closes that gap is that such a getter has nowhere to read the
  marker from.

A marker held across calls fails the first of these. A value may legitimately
contain a subtree of some *earlier* encoding — the code that assembled it is
entitled to whatever it has seen — and a copy-on-write walk carries such a
subtree through unchanged, into a data position. A long-lived marker sitting
there would be read as a tagged form, and user data would decode as a tagged
value.

The marker must itself be an encodable fabric value, for that same reason: a
value holding an earlier call's marker has to encode without complaint, being
ordinary data.

### 2.3 What the Marker Is Not

The marker is **not a secret and not authentication**. Whatever asks for an
encoding is trusted with the result, and whatever receives a payload is trusted
to read it. A hostile peer builds its own marker and forges freely — exactly as
it could always send any tagged value it liked, under any format.

What the marker rules out is *confusion within a payload this encoder
produced*, which is the escaping problem and the whole of what it is for.

### 2.4 Version

The marker is a frozen one-element array holding the version identifier:

```
["fvr1"]
```

`fvr1` is *fabric value, realm encoding, version 1*, in the manner of JSON's
`fvj1:` prefix. Recognition never reads any of it — identity does all the work
— so within the walk the contents serve only to be legible in a debugger.

**A decoder must refuse an outer envelope whose marker is not a one-element
array holding the version it implements**, and it performs that check before
adopting the marker. This is the format's answer to a boundary it does not
otherwise control: `postMessage()` spans tabs, windows and frames, any of which
could pair two different deployments, and a payload written by a build the
decoder does not understand is refused rather than walked.

The check earns little in the deployment this format is for, where both ends
are the same build and the marker always matches. It costs one comparison, and
it is what makes adoption safe to state as a rule: without it a decoder takes
an arbitrary object as its marker, every tagged form beneath goes unrecognized,
and a foreign tree decodes as ordinary data instead of being refused.

## 3. Type Encodings

### 3.1 Self-Representing Types

Carried by the transport as themselves, with no tag:

`null`, `undefined`, `boolean`, `number` (including `-0`, `NaN`, and
`±Infinity`), `bigint`, `string`.

Where JSON must tag four of the seven primitive types, this format tags one.
`symbol` is the exception — the transport refuses it outright — so it crosses
under a tag like any other value a transport cannot carry directly.

### 3.2 Containers

Arrays and plain objects are carried directly.

- **Array holes need no representation.** Cloning preserves a sparse array's
  length and its absent indices, so a hole crosses as a hole. There is no
  counterpart to JSON's `/hole` run-length form. **A walk that rebuilds a
  sparse array must leave its holes absent**, on both sides: writing
  `undefined` into them would satisfy the transport requirement in Section 1.1
  and still deliver present-`undefined` where the sender had absence, which
  this system distinguishes. Length is preserved with them, a trailing hole
  having nothing else to record it.
- **Keys are visited in their own order**, not sorted. JSON sorts to make its
  text canonical, which is what lets an encoding be hashed and compared as
  bytes; nothing here is compared that way, and sorting would force a rebuild
  of every object.
- **A `/`-prefixed key is ordinary.** This format reserves no key.

A key this runtime reserves — `__proto__` or `constructor` — is refused on both
sides, because a rebuild by assignment cannot reproduce one faithfully.

### 3.3 The Tagged Form

A value that a codec claims is encoded as a three-element array:

```
[marker, tag, state]
```

`tag` is the wire type tag (`3-json-encoding.md` Section 2 defines the
`<Type>@<Version>` syntax, which is shared). `state` is the codec's encoded
state — final for a terminal codec, and itself walked for a nonterminal one.

Three positional slots rather than a container keyed by the tag, because an
array is the cheapest shape the transport carries: no hash table, and a tag
string that is the codec's own constant rather than a key built per tagged
form.

### 3.4 Standard Type Encodings

| Type | Tag | State |
|---|---|---|
| `FabricBytes` | `Bytes@1` | `ArrayBuffer` |
| `FabricHash` | `Hash@1` | `{ tag: string, hash: ArrayBuffer }` |
| `FabricEpochDays` | `EpochDays@1` | `bigint` |
| `FabricEpochNsec` | `EpochNsec@1` | `bigint` |
| `FabricRegExp` | `RegExp@1` | `{ source, flags, flavor }` |
| `symbol` | `Symbol@1` | `string` (the registry key) |

Bytes travel as a bare `ArrayBuffer` rather than as a view onto one, that being
what `postMessage()` can *transfer*: a caller assembling a transfer list finds
the transferable object in the tree rather than having to reach through a view
and reason about its offset. Both byte-carrying types do this. A bare
`Uint8Array` is therefore not a form this format emits.

Three of these differ from their JSON counterparts in kind rather than in
spelling, which is most of the reason this format exists, and they differ along
two axes.

`FabricBytes` carries bytes as bytes, where JSON must represent them as
base64url text. `FabricRegExp` is terminal here and nonterminal under JSON —
concrete proof that terminality belongs to the pair (class, format) rather than
to the class. `FabricHash` differs on **both** axes at once: terminal here and
nonterminal under JSON, and carrying its hash as a bare `ArrayBuffer` where
JSON carries base64url text.

Types binding a format-neutral codec — `FabricError`, `UnknownValue`,
`ProblematicValue`, and every `FabricInstance` — encode the same way under both
formats, their state being fabric values all the way down.

## 4. Cycles and Shared References

Per Section 1.6 of [1-fabric-values.md](./1-fabric-values.md), an engine must
state what it does about each. This format:

- **Refuses cycles**, in both directions.
- **Preserves a shared reference exactly where nothing beneath it needed
  encoding.**

Neither answer comes from the transport, which would carry either faithfully;
both come from the walk.

The two directions refuse a cycle differently, for the reason they differ
everywhere else. Encoding **raises**: the value is a local caller's, and a
cycle in it is that caller's bug. Decoding **reports**, settled against the
engine's leniency, because a cycle arriving on a channel is untrusted data like
any other malformation — and cloning delivers one faithfully, so a peer can
send one.

Sharing is preserved by copy-on-write rather than by a memo. A subtree needing
no encoding is returned by identity, so every position that held the one object
still holds it. Where a shared subtree *does* need encoding, each position
rebuilds it independently, and the encoding holds two equal objects where the
value held one — structure a receiver cannot distinguish from two that were
always distinct.

## 5. Ownership

The two directions divide the memory they are handed in opposite ways, and
each is easy to get wrong in a way nothing reports.

### 5.1 Encoding

**An encoded tree shares structure with the value it was built from, and is
not frozen.** Copy-on-write is what makes that so: a subtree needing no
encoding *is* that subtree rather than a reconstruction of it, which is the
same mechanism Section 4 credits with preserving shared references.

So a value must not be mutated after it is encoded. A caller that does so
changes the encoded tree, and over a transport that clones on send, changes
what arrives — with nothing raising, because nothing has gone wrong as far as
either side can see. Encode last, or encode a value nothing else is holding.

Only the outer envelope is new on every call. It and the marker are two
allocations; nothing beneath them is rebuilt unless it needed encoding.

### 5.2 Decoding

**A caller cedes the tree to `decode()`.** The decoder retains what it likes of
it, and **a decoded tree carries no guarantee of being usable again**. This is
a promise withheld rather than a prohibition imposed: nothing detects a second
decode or sets out to defeat one, and whether a given tree survives depends
entirely on what it happened to carry. A caller that reuses one is relying on
the shape of its own data, not on anything stated here.

Two retentions are deliberate:

1. A subtree needing no decoding is returned by identity rather than rebuilt.
2. A byte-carrying value **takes over** the `ArrayBuffer` it arrived in rather
   than copying it.

**Every container a decode returns is frozen**, retained and rebuilt alike.
Stating it of the result rather than of what is retained is deliberate: an
implementation that rebuilt everything would retain nothing, and a rule phrased
around retention would then oblige it to freeze nothing and let it hand back
mutable values. Which containers a caller sees returned by identity therefore
varies with what needed decoding; whether any of them is mutable does not.

An `ArrayBuffer` cannot be frozen, which is what makes ceding it a requirement
rather than a courtesy: sole ownership is the only available defense for a
value that promises its bytes are immutable.

**A failed decode consumes the tree as thoroughly as a successful one.** A
refusal can arrive after the walk has already detached a buffer and frozen part
of what it reached, so the guarantee is no better for a call that raised. In
particular, answering a strict refusal by re-running the same tree through a
lenient decoder does not work: the second run finds the bytes gone and reports
a `ProblematicValue` where they had been. Choose the disposition before
decoding, not after.

**A tree carrying bytes is the case where the guarantee definitely fails.**
Taking a buffer over detaches it, so a second decode of such a tree cannot
reconstruct what the first did, and the attempt is settled against leniency
like every other refusal in Section 6: a strict decode raises, and a lenient
one yields a `ProblematicValue` where the bytes would have been. A byte-free
tree happens to survive a second decode today, which is a fact about this
encoding's containers rather than a promise to build on.

On the boundary this format exists for, none of this costs a caller anything —
the tree is the receiver's own clone of a value it will not be handed again,
which is the whole reason the copy can be elided. A caller wanting two readings
of one payload keeps the value it decoded, not the tree it decoded from.

## 6. Refusals

A conforming decoder refuses, reporting each as a malformation settled against
leniency:

- An outer envelope that is not a two-element array, or whose slot zero is not
  a one-element array holding the decoder's own version, per Section 2.4.
- A `symbol` or a function found in an untagged position. The transport carries
  neither, so neither can arrive across the boundary — but a decoder is
  callable in the realm that built its argument, and what the format never
  emits is refused wherever it is found.
- Any other value the transport carries but this format never emits: a bare
  `Uint8Array` or `DataView`, a bare `ArrayBuffer` outside a tagged state, a
  `Date`, a `Map`, a `Set`, or any other class instance. `ArrayBuffer` is worth
  naming: it is the one such type this format's own value union contains, and
  it is legitimate only as the state under a byte-carrying tag.
- A key this runtime reserves, per Section 3.2.
- A tag that is not syntactically a tag, per Section 9 of
  [3-json-encoding.md](./3-json-encoding.md), whose tag syntax this format
  shares.
- A cycle, per Section 4.

A tag that is *syntactically* a tag but that no codec claims is not a refusal:
it becomes an `UnknownValue` and round-trips, exactly as under JSON
(`3-json-encoding.md` Section 8).

## 7. Serialization Context Responsibilities

The realm encoding context is responsible for:

- Minting a marker per `encode()` call, per Section 2.2, and building the
  outer envelope around the walked tree.
- Adopting the marker from the outer envelope's slot zero on decode, after
  validating that envelope's shape and the marker's version per Section 2.4 —
  the one place the decoder takes instruction from the data it is reading.
- Owning recursion and tag-wrapping around the shallow per-type codecs, as the
  JSON context does (`3-json-encoding.md` Section 7): tags come from
  `codec.tagForValue(value)` on encode, and decode routes each tag to its
  registered codec.
- Re-wrapping unknown types using the per-instance `wireTypeTag` preserved in
  `UnknownValue`, and constructing `UnknownValue` for tags with no registered
  codec.
- Settling a codec's rejection according to leniency, identically to JSON.

There is no escaping step and no stringify step, both of which the JSON context
carries.

### 7.1 Codec State Validation

A codec **validates the state it is handed and rejects what it will not
accept**, rather than coercing it. Wire data is untrusted: a `Bytes@1` whose
state is a string, a `Hash@1` whose `tag` is not a string, a `Symbol@1` whose
state is not a string — each is a malformation, settled against leniency like
any other, and never a value built from whatever arrived.

This is a requirement rather than an observation. An implementation that
coerced instead would satisfy every other claim in this document while
producing values a sender never sent.

**A field of a codec's state that the codec does not read is ignored, not
refused.** A state is matched by what it must carry, so a record arriving with
more than that decodes as though the extra were absent. Two implementations
would otherwise be free to disagree — one ignoring, one refusing — over data
that cloning carries perfectly well and that a peer can send.
