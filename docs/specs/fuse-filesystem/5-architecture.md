## Deno FFI Approach

The FUSE child process calls libfuse via `Deno.dlopen()`. All filesystem logic —
FUSE operations, cell access, caching, inode management — lives in TypeScript.
`cf fuse mount` foreground mode starts one FFI-owning child process and waits for
it without adding a supervisor; direct `deno run packages/fuse/mod.ts` is a
single-process invocation of the same child entrypoint. Background mounts add a
small Deno supervisor process outside libfuse; the supervisor starts the FUSE
child, records the child PID in mount state, forwards termination, and waits for
the child to publish explicit readiness before `cf fuse mount --background`
reports success.

### Why keep FUSE logic in Deno?

- **One language, one build system.** No Rust toolchain, no Cargo, no
  cross-language data duplication. Everything stays in the Deno monorepo.
- **No data-plane IPC overhead.** The in-memory tree is directly accessible from
  FUSE callbacks. No serialization, no Unix sockets, no JSON-RPC protocol is on
  the request path.
- **Contained lifecycle split.** `cf fuse mount --background` uses a supervisor
  only for process lifecycle/readiness, while foreground CLI mounts remain a
  direct parent/child wait without a supervisor.
- **Easier debugging.** Single stack trace, single log stream, standard Deno
  debugging tools.

### How FFI Works

libfuse provides a C API where you register callback functions for each
filesystem operation. Deno's FFI (`Deno.dlopen`) can load libfuse and
register `Deno.UnsafeCallback` instances as those callbacks.

#### Threading Model

libfuse normally uses a thread pool, but FUSE callbacks from non-main threads
cannot safely access the Deno JS heap. Two viable approaches:

**Option A — Single-threaded mode (recommended for v1):**

libfuse supports single-threaded operation (`-s` flag / `FUSE_SINGLE_THREAD`).
In this mode, all FUSE requests are dispatched sequentially on one thread. We
use `fuse_session_fd()` to get the FUSE file descriptor and integrate it with
Deno's event loop:

```typescript
// Shown inside a pattern body.
const fuseSessionFd = fuse_session_fd(session);

// Poll the FUSE fd alongside Deno's event loop
while (mounted) {
  // Process pending FUSE requests (non-blocking)
  fuse_session_process_buf(session, buf);

  // Yield to Deno event loop for async work (subscriptions, etc.)
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
}
```

All FUSE callbacks run on the main thread and can directly access the
in-memory tree. No thread safety concerns. The tradeoff is no parallelism
for FUSE operations, which is fine for this use case — we're serving `cat`
and `ls` against cached JSON, not high-throughput I/O.

Dynamic directory preparation is tracked per open directory handle. The first
`readdir` prepares the view; continuation offsets reuse it, and `releasedir`
discards the preparation state. In particular, a large `entities/` listing
uses stable protocol pages once and does not add an inode to the filesystem
tree for every identifier. Exact entity paths use a bounded projection cache.
See [Entity Lookup, Enumeration, and Performance](./11-entity-lookup-enumeration.md)
for the storage and hydration boundaries behind that rule.

**Option B — Worker threads with SharedArrayBuffer:**

For higher throughput, the in-memory tree could be backed by a
`SharedArrayBuffer` that FUSE worker threads read from. Writes and cache
updates still go through the main thread. This is significantly more
complex and only worth pursuing if single-threaded mode proves too slow.

### FFI Surface

The FFI layer needs to bind a relatively small subset of libfuse:

```typescript
// Shown for illustration only.
// Core session lifecycle
fuse_session_new(args, ops, ops_size, userdata): FuseSession
fuse_session_mount(session, mountpoint): number
fuse_session_unmount(session): void
fuse_session_destroy(session): void
fuse_session_fd(session): number
fuse_session_exited(session): boolean

// Request processing
fuse_session_process_buf(session, buf): void
fuse_session_receive_buf(session, buf): number

// Reply functions (called from within callbacks)
fuse_reply_entry(req, entry): number
fuse_reply_attr(req, attr, timeout): number
fuse_reply_readlink(req, link): number
fuse_reply_open(req, fi): number
fuse_reply_write(req, count): number
fuse_reply_buf(req, buf, size): number
fuse_reply_err(req, errno): number
```

The `fuse_lowlevel_ops` struct contains function pointers for each operation.
We populate it with `Deno.UnsafeCallback` instances for the operations we
support.

### Platform Differences

| | macOS | Linux |
|---|-------|-------|
| Provider | macFUSE or FUSE-T | Native kernel FUSE |
| Library | `libfuse.dylib` (v2.9) | `libfuse3.so` (v3) |
| API | FUSE v2 low-level | FUSE v3 low-level |
| xattr errors | `ENOATTR` | `ENODATA` |
| Install | User installs macFUSE/FUSE-T | Usually pre-installed |

The FFI bindings need a thin compatibility layer to handle v2 vs v3
differences. FUSE-T is preferred on macOS (no kernel extension required).

## Alternative: Rust FUSE Daemon + IPC

If FFI proves too limiting (e.g., threading becomes necessary, or libfuse's
C API is too painful to bind), a fallback architecture splits the work:

```
              +---------------------+
              |   Rust FUSE Layer   |   packages/fuse-daemon/
              |   (fuser crate)     |
              +---------------------+
                         |
                    IPC (JSON-RPC over Unix socket)
                         |
              +---------------------+
              |   Deno Service      |   packages/fuse/
              +---------------------+
```

The Rust layer (`fuser` crate) handles FUSE operations from its own in-memory
tree. The Deno layer handles all cell/space logic and pushes updates via
JSON-RPC over a Unix socket.

**When to consider this:**
- Single-threaded FUSE can't keep up with the workload
- libfuse FFI bindings are too fragile across macOS/Linux
- The C struct layouts are too painful to maintain by hand

**Cost:**
- Second language and build system (Cargo)
- IPC protocol design and maintenance
- Data duplication (tree in both processes)
- Two-process lifecycle management

## Alternative: npm:fuse-native

Deno supports npm packages via `npm:` specifiers. `fuse-native` provides
N-API bindings to libfuse with multithreaded support:

```typescript
import Fuse from "npm:fuse-native";
```

**When to consider this:** If it works out of the box with Deno's npm compat.
Worth a quick spike before committing to raw FFI.

**Risk:** N-API native addon compatibility with Deno is not guaranteed.
`fuse-native` is a C++ addon that may not load. The SageMath fork
(`@sagemathinc/fuse-native`) is the most actively maintained version.

## Package Structure

```
packages/
  fuse/                          # Deno package (new)
    deno.jsonc
    mod.ts                       # Entry point
    ffi.ts                       # libfuse FFI bindings
    ffi-types.ts                 # C struct definitions for Deno FFI
    fs.ts                        # FUSE operation handlers
    tree.ts                      # In-memory filesystem tree + inode mgmt
    tree-builder.ts              # JSON value -> FsNode conversion
    cell-bridge.ts               # Maps FUSE ops to cell ops
    directory-handles.ts         # Per-open dynamic-directory preparation
    types.ts                     # Shared types
    cli.ts                       # CLI command handlers (mount/unmount)
    tests/
      tree-builder.test.ts
      cell-bridge.test.ts
      fs.test.ts
  cli/
    commands/fuse.ts             # cf fuse subcommand (new)
```

## CLI Integration

The FUSE filesystem is accessed via the existing `cf` CLI:

```bash
cf fuse mount <mountpoint> [options]
cf fuse unmount <mountpoint>
cf fuse status
```

`cf fuse status` reports `MOUNTPOINT`, `SUPERVISOR_PID`, `CHILD_PID`, `STATUS`,
`STARTED`, and `LOG` for active background mounts. `STATUS` is read from the
FUSE child's readiness/heartbeat sidecar when available.

Options:
- `--api-url <url>` — toolshed API URL
- `--identity <keyfile>` — identity for authentication
- `--background` — run under a non-FFI supervisor and return after child
  readiness
- `--debug` — enable FUSE debug logging

All accessible spaces are exposed under the single mountpoint. The home space
is always listed; other spaces are accessible by name or DID on demand (see
[Path Scheme](./2-path-scheme.md#listing-vs-lookup)).

The `mount` command:
1. Connects to toolshed, loads identity
2. For foreground mounts, starts the FUSE child directly
3. For background mounts, starts a non-FFI supervisor process
4. The supervisor starts the FFI-owning FUSE child, records `childPid`, and
   forwards cleanup signals
5. The child loads libfuse via `Deno.dlopen()`, registers FUSE callbacks, mounts
   the filesystem, and writes `starting`/`mounted`/`failed`/`exiting`/`exited`
   readiness states plus a heartbeat
6. The CLI reports background startup success only after the matching child
   readiness sidecar reaches `mounted`

Sessions for individual spaces are created lazily on first access.
