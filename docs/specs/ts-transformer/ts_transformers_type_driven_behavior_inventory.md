# TS Transformers Type-Driven Behavior Inventory

This note is intentionally narrow.

It lists the places where checker/type information affects transformer behavior:
- lowering choices
- validation/diagnostics
- callback/context classification
- capture behavior

It does not list pure schema-generation/type-emission code unless that code exists specifically to preserve later behavioral decisions.

## Main Behavioral Type Dependencies

- `src/ast/call-kind.ts`
  - `isReactiveValueExpression(...)`
  - `hasReactiveCollectionProvenance(...)`
  - `classifyArrayMethodCallSite(...)`
  - `classifyArrayCallbackContainerCall(...)`
  - `resolveExpressionKind(...)`
  - `resolveBuilderExpressionKind(...)`
  These checker-backed paths decide whether values are reactive, whether collection methods are reactive/plain, whether callbacks are plain-array-value vs plain-array-void, and how builder/runtime calls are recognized through aliases/signatures.

- `src/policy/rewrite-policy.ts`
  - `classifyReactiveReceiverKind(...)`
  - `shouldRewriteCollectionMethod(...)`
  Uses `isReactiveType(...)` and `getCellKind(...)` to distinguish:
  - plain receivers
  - opaque values that auto-unwrap in compute contexts
  - cell/stream receivers that still require rewrite

- `src/ast/dataflow.ts`
  The dataflow analyzer uses `checker.getTypeAtLocation(...)`, `isReactiveType(...)`, `isReactiveValueExpression(...)`, and `symbolDeclaresCommonFabricDefault(...)` to decide:
  - `containsReactive`
  - `requiresRewrite`
  - which expressions become explicit dependencies

- `src/closures/strategies/array-method-strategy.ts`
  - `shouldTransformArrayMethod(...)`
  Uses receiver type/provenance to decide whether `map/filter/flatMap` become `mapWithPattern/filterWithPattern/flatMapWithPattern`.

- `src/transformers/opaque-get-validation.ts`
  Uses receiver type plus `getCellKind(...)` to allow `.get()` only on true cell/stream reads and reject it on opaque/reactive values.

- `src/transformers/call-root-support.ts`
  Uses receiver type plus `getCellKind(...)` to allow helper-owned `.get()` only for true cell/stream receivers.

- `src/transformers/expression-rewrite/emitters/helper-owned-expression.ts`
  Uses receiver type plus `getCellKind(...)` for the same helper-owned explicit-read distinction during rewriting.

- `src/transformers/expression-rewrite/emitters/binary-expression.ts`
  Uses `isReactiveValueExpression(...)` and `isSimpleReactiveAccessExpression(...)` to make logical-expression lowering decisions, especially for `&&` / `||`.

- `src/ast/event-handlers.ts`
  `isEventHandlerJsxAttribute(...)` uses contextual type to classify non-`on*` JSX props as event-handler sites when the expected type looks handler-like.

- `src/policy/callback-boundary.ts`
  Consumes type-backed event-handler and array-callback classification to decide callback boundary kind and whether the callback body is pattern-owned, compute-owned, or unsupported.

- `src/ast/reactive-context.ts`
  Builds effective pattern/compute/neutral context on top of the callback-boundary and call-kind decisions above.

- `src/transformers/expression-site-policy.ts`
  Consumes the type-backed callback/context/array-ownership classifications to decide whether an expression site is:
  - shared
  - owned
  - skipped
  - lowerable

- `src/transformers/expression-rewrite/rewrite-helpers.ts`
  `isOpaqueCallParameter(...)` depends on reactive array callback ownership and reactive context classification when filtering wrapper captures.

- `src/ast/scope-analysis.ts`
  `isFunctionDeclaration(...)` uses initializer type call signatures to decide whether a declaration should count as a plain function for capture/serialization policy.

- `src/ast/factory-callee.ts`
  `classifyFactoryValueOrigin(...)`, `classifyFactoryCallTarget(...)`, and
  `classifyFactoryCallExposure(...)` use trusted semantic factory types,
  declarations, callback signatures, and call sites to decide:
  - live vs symbolic vs runtime-materialized origin
  - invocation vs `asScope()` / `inSpace()` derivation
  - nearest decisive eager/scheduled boundary
  - stable helper exposure, including mixed/unknown fail-closed cases

- `src/transformers/symbolic-factory-call.ts`
  Uses exact trusted factory types or compiler-owned contract hints to decide
  whether a union is callable. Same-kind arms require equal normalized public
  input/output schemas and equal FrameworkProvided paths; cross-kind,
  schema-mismatched, partially provenanced, and callable/non-callable unions
  diagnose instead of selecting an arm.

- `src/transformers/framework-provided.ts` and
  `src/policy/framework-provided.ts`
  Type provenance and the private FrameworkProvided brand identify protected
  factory input paths. The forwarding stage uses those paths to decide whether
  eager pattern calls can be rewritten and whether scheduled calls must reject.

- Nested-pattern factory capture/boundary classification
  Authored nested `pattern(...)` calls use the `pattern-builder` boundary.
  Capture analysis produces private callback argument 1, carries its schema via
  `withPatternParamsSchema`, and emits one private `.curry(params)` at a
  capturing site. Tool descriptors do not define a separate boundary: direct
  and metadata-wrapped PatternFactory values use the same path.

## Behavior-Preserving Type Handoffs

These are not new policy decisions by themselves, but they preserve type information so later behavior-affecting checks still work on synthetic/transformed nodes.

- `src/closures/strategies/lift-applied-strategy.ts`
  - `preRegisterCaptureTypes(...)`
  - `rewriteCaptureReferences(...)`
  Unwrap opaque captures to `T` inside lift-applied callbacks, while preserving `Cell<T>` / `Stream<T>` as wrapped.

- `src/transformers/builtins/lift-applied.ts`
  - `replaceReactivesWithParams(...)`
  Registers synthetic lift-applied parameters with unwrapped types for the same reason.

- `src/transformers/pattern-body-reactive-root-lowering.ts`
  - `registerReplacementType(...)`
  Copies original types onto replacement nodes so downstream behavior checks still see the intended type.

- `src/transformers/expression-rewrite/rewrite-helpers.ts`
  - `createReactiveWrapperForExpression(...)`
  Registers synthetic computed-wrapper result types so later checker-backed logic remains coherent.

- `src/core/cross-stage-state.ts` and
  `src/ast/factory-contract-hints.ts`
  `SchemaHint.factoryContracts`, `factoryContractsBySymbol`, and the live
  derivation marker preserve exact factory kind/input/output/protected-path
  provenance across forwarding, symbolic invocation, closure conversion, and
  schema generation. Compiler-owned hints take precedence over type
  reconstruction, and each union arm carries its own authority.

- `src/transformers/framework-provided.ts`
  The forwarding pass annotates type queries, aliases, and union nodes with
  exact contracts; the later metadata pass attaches trusted callback paths only
  after schema and callback lowering.

## Explicitly Excluded

These areas are type-heavy but are primarily schema/type-emission concerns, not behavioral policy:

- `src/transformers/schema-injection.ts`
- `src/transformers/schema-generator.ts`
- `src/transformers/type-shrinking.ts`
- most of `src/ast/type-inference.ts`
- `src/closures/utils/schema-factory.ts`
- `src/closures/strategies/action-strategy.ts`

## Bottom Line

The current transformer pipeline is still behaviorally type-aware.

The main live dependencies are:
- reactive value / reactive collection classification
- array-method ownership and `*WithPattern` decisions
- `.get()` legality
- event-handler / callback / reactive-context classification
- TypeRegistry handoffs that preserve those decisions across synthetic nodes
- factory origin, decisive execution exposure, and invocation-vs-derivation
  classification
- exact factory union contracts and FrameworkProvided provenance handoffs
