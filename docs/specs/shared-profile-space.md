# Shared Profile Space

## Status

Implementation spec — **partially superseded** by multi-profile support
(PR #3830). This document describes the original *single* shared profile linked
at `homeSpaceCell.defaultPattern.profile`. The home space now stores a **list**
of profiles (`defaultPattern.profiles`) plus `defaultProfile` and a
recency-ordered `mru`, and `#profile` resolves the default (then by MRU) and
launches a picker for 2+ profiles. For the current model see
`docs/common/conventions/HOME_SPACE.md` (Profile section) and
`docs/common/conventions/wish.md` (Well-Known Profile Targets). The per-profile
*space* shape, owner-protection, and `wish()` resolution described below still
hold per profile.

This document captures the target behavior for shared user profiles across
multi-user patterns. It is intended to drive implementation across home-space
schema, profile-space creation, default-pattern selection, `wish()` resolution,
authorization, and integration tests.

## Summary

Multi-user patterns should not ask each user for their display name and avatar
inside every pattern. A user has one shared profile space, linked from their
home space. Patterns can discover profile data and profile-hosted pieces through
`wish()` without knowing the profile space DID up front.

The profile is a real space. Its `spaceCell.defaultPattern` is a new
profile-specific default pattern, not the normal space default app. The profile
default pattern initially owns:

- the profile owner's name and avatar
- a list of profile elements, implemented as pieces in the profile space
- owner-only handlers for adding profile elements from a fixed catalog or a
  pattern URL

The user's home space links to the profile through a well-known field on the
home default pattern, following the same durable field pattern as favorites. If
the link is missing, the home pattern renders a profile-name input. Submitting a
name starts the profile default pattern in a new profile space via
`PatternFactory.inSpace(...)` and stores the created profile default-pattern link
on the home default pattern.

`wish()` gains a profile search scope for hashtag queries. A profile-scoped wish
searches pieces in the current user's profile space whose descriptions or user
tags contain the requested hashtag, analogous to the existing favorites and
mentionables hashtag paths.

Patterns that render viewer-specific profile data from a shared space should
make that rendered result user-scoped. For example, a shared demo pattern that
directly renders `wish({ query: "#profileName" })` should use a user-scoped
result schema so each viewer sees their own profile projection.

## Goals

- Provide one durable profile per authenticated user.
- Keep profile data separate from ordinary home-space settings and from
  per-collaboration-space data.
- Make profile discovery work from any space the user visits.
- Let profile owners add profile elements without exposing direct mutation of
  the profile element list.
- Add an integration test that creates a profile and proves a demo multi-user
  pattern can render the user's shared name.
- Make `wish({ query: "#profile" })` resolve to the current user's profile
  default pattern. Existing learned-summary consumers must migrate to a more
  explicit target before relying on this feature.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing the home space. The home space remains the user's singleton root for
  settings, favorites, spaces, and the profile-space link.
- Designing a full rich profile data model. The first profile default pattern
  only needs name, avatar, and add-element mechanics.
- Migrating every current profile-like pattern in one change.
- Making `wish()` scope strings part of the cell storage scope lattice. This
  document uses "wish scope" for search domains; it is separate from
  `space | user | session` cell instance scopes.

## Current Repo Facts

- `Runtime.getHomeSpaceCell()` creates the home space cell at
  `(space = userIdentityDID, cause = userIdentityDID)`.
- `PiecesController.ensureDefaultPattern()` links a default pattern at
  `spaceCell.defaultPattern`. Today it chooses `system/home.tsx` for the home
  space and `system/default-app.tsx` for other spaces.
- The current home pattern owns durable cells such as `favorites`, `journal`,
  `learned`, `spaces`, and `defaultAppUrl` on the home default pattern.
- The current docs say favorites are on `spaceCell.favorites`, but current code
  uses `homeSpaceCell.defaultPattern.favorites`. The implemented profile flow
  follows that actual shape and stores the profile link at
  `homeSpaceCell.defaultPattern.profile`.
- `PatternFactory.inSpace(space?: string | AnyCell<unknown>)` exists. DID
  strings and cell arguments resolve synchronously; named spaces and omitted
  spaces resolve during async action/handler post-run. Post-run resolution
  replaces the runtime annotation itself with the resolved DID; unresolved names
  must not survive outside the handler frame.
- `wish()` currently supports scope values `"~"` for home favorites, `"."` for
  current-space mentionables, and arbitrary DIDs for other spaces.
- The string `#profile` was previously a well-known home target that resolved
  to `home.defaultPattern.learned.summary`. This implementation intentionally
  retargets it to the profile default pattern so profile-aware patterns have a
  direct well-known profile entry point.

## Data Model

### Home Default Pattern Link

Add a well-known field to the home default pattern:

```ts
type HomeDefaultPattern = {
  favorites: Favorite[];
  profile?: Cell<ProfileDefaultPattern>;
  profileName?: string;
};
```

`profile` is a cell link to the profile default pattern. The linked cell lives
in the profile space, so its normalized link carries the profile space DID:

```ts
homeSpaceCell.defaultPattern.profile -> profile default pattern cell
```

`homeSpaceCell.profileSpace` is not part of the target v1 shape. Earlier
implementation notes used that name for the durable link, but the implemented
home-field convention is `homeSpaceCell.defaultPattern.profile`.

### Profile Space Identity

Profile creation uses the **anonymous** `PatternFactory.inSpace()` (CT-1650):

```ts
const profile = ProfileHome.inSpace()({ initialName: name });
```

The argument MUST be omitted. A *named* `inSpace(spaceName)` derives the space
DID from `Identity.fromPassphrase("common user").derive(spaceName)` (the
`createSession` spaceName path) — the name ALONE, ignoring the authenticated
user — so two users picking the same profile name, or one user creating two
same-named profiles, collide into a single shared space. The anonymous case
instead derives a fresh DID from the creating handler's frame cause (per-user
home-space input links + the durable per-event id), so the space is unique per
user AND per creation event, stable across the cross-space-commit retry. The
display name is therefore independent of the space identity (it flows only to
`initialName` and stays editable). The home default pattern's `profile` link is
the durable source of truth after creation, and runtime-only `.inSpace`
annotations are rewritten to the resolved DID during post-run.

### Profile Default Pattern Output

The initial profile default pattern should export this contract:

```ts
type ProfileElement = {
  cell: Cell<unknown>;
  tag: string;
  userTags: string[];
  title?: string;
  source?: "catalog" | "url";
};

type ProfileDefaultPattern = {
  [NAME]: string;
  [UI]: VNode;
  name: string;
  avatar: string;
  bio: string;
  elements: ProfileElement[];
  addElement: Stream<AddProfileElementEvent>;
  removeElement: Stream<{ cell: Cell<unknown> }>;
  setBio: Stream<SetProfileBioEvent>;
  initialNameApplied: string;
};
```

`avatar` starts as a string. The first implementation can use a URL, data URL,
or emoji-like text. Binary/blob avatar upload is out of scope.

`bio` (CT-1648) is a short, owner-authored free-text description, the canonical
shared-profile bio — distinct from Home's legacy `learned.summary`. Like `name`
and `avatar` it is owner-protected (written only through `setBio`), readable
from the profile result, and exposed as the well-known wish target
`#profileBio`.

`elements` is the profile-space analog of favorites and mentionables. Each
entry points at a piece that lives in the profile space. `tag` stores the
snapshot string used for hashtag search, following the favorites pattern:
explicit tag if supplied, otherwise a serialized schema/description snapshot.
`userTags` stores user-supplied tags without `#`.

The profile default pattern may also include an internal `allPieces` list if
that is useful for rendering, but external code must depend on `elements` and
`addElement`, not `allPieces`.

## Profile Default Pattern Selection

Default pattern creation needs a third case:

1. Home space: `/api/patterns/system/home.tsx`
2. Profile space: `/api/patterns/system/profile-home.tsx`
3. Other spaces: home `defaultPattern.defaultAppUrl` or
   `/api/patterns/system/default-app.tsx`

A profile space is not identified by `space === userIdentityDID`. It is
identified by the profile default-pattern link at
`homeSpaceCell.defaultPattern.profile`, whose normalized link carries the
profile space DID, or by the explicit profile-creation path before the link
exists. Implementation options:

- Add `ensureProfileDefaultPattern(profileSpaceDID)` and
  `recreateProfileDefaultPattern(profileSpaceDID)` instead of overloading
  `ensureDefaultPattern()`.
- Or add a `defaultPatternKind: "home" | "profile" | "space"` option to the
  default-pattern controller, with profile creation passing `"profile"`.

The first option is safer because opening an arbitrary non-home space should
continue to use the ordinary default app unless it is reached through the
profile-space creation/link path.

## Home Pattern Flow

The home pattern owns `homeDefaultPattern.profile`.

If `profile` is missing:

- render an input field for the user's profile name
- submitting it stores the requested name, which drives a profile-creation
  action/lift
- that action starts `system/profile-home.tsx` with the anonymous `.inSpace()`
  (see Profile Space Identity above), passes the submitted name as the initial
  profile name, and writes the resulting profile
  default-pattern link to `homeDefaultPattern.profile`

If `profile` is present:

- render the profile default pattern or a compact summary based on
  `profile.name` and `profile.avatar`

This write targets the home default pattern because that is the current durable
home-field convention used by favorites. If custom home pattern replacement
needs to preserve profile links independently, that should be handled as a
separate migration.

## Adding Profile Elements

Profile elements are added through the profile default pattern's `addElement`
stream. Callers must not push to `elements` directly.

`AddProfileElementEvent` initially supports two sources:

```ts
type AddProfileElementEvent =
  | { catalogId: string }
  | { patternUrl: string; title?: string; tag?: string };
```

The fixed catalog is a small allowlist of pattern URLs or module descriptors
owned by the profile default pattern. URL-based creation compiles the supplied
pattern URL using the same resolver path as ordinary piece creation.

The handler creates the piece in the profile space, snapshots its searchable
tag, deduplicates by cell identity, and appends a `ProfileElement`.

## Authorization

The v1 protected data is the profile default pattern's owner-controlled fields
and element mutations:

- `profileDefault.name`
- `profileDefault.avatar`
- `profileDefault.elements`
- `profileDefault.addElement` / `profileDefault.removeElement` writes that
  mutate `elements`

Those protected fields must carry owner integrity shaped like:

```ts
{ kind: "represents-principal", subject: ownerDid }
```

Writes to those fields must satisfy the owner integrity and must be
`WriteAuthorizedBy` the trusted profile handlers or trusted profile UI actions.
This is CFC-enforced, not UI-only. The UI may hide editing controls for
non-owners, but that is only a convenience check.

The home link write to `homeSpaceCell.defaultPattern.profile` is durable and
protected by CFC as profile-link data. It carries static `"profile-link"`
integrity and is `WriteAuthorizedBy` the profile-link creation flow in the home
default pattern. This is separate from the profile owner's
`represents-principal` integrity on the profile default fields: v1 protects the
link against direct untrusted writes, but does not add a second owner-specific
atom to the home link itself.

Profile creation UI rendered by `wish({ query: "#profile" })[UI]` must be
vended through a trusted pattern surface, not raw runner-owned input markup. The
trusted surface sends the same create-profile event used by the home profile tab
and leaves navigation unchanged. The transient requested-name trigger that feeds
this flow is ordinary home default-pattern state; the durable protected surface
is the resulting `homeSpaceCell.defaultPattern.profile` link.

The owner check should use `runtime.userIdentityDID` / `storageManager.as.did()`
as the authenticated principal. It should not use the current collaboration
space DID. If static CFC authoring aliases cannot express exact owner-DID
requirements, profile creation should use a profile schema factory that embeds
the owner DID into the profile default schema.

## Wish Scope

### Scope Value

Add a profile wish scope value:

```ts
type WishScope = "~" | "." | "profile" | DID;
```

The string `"profile"` is reserved and must be removed from the arbitrary-DID
bucket. Today `getArbitraryDIDs()` treats every non-`"~"`/`"."` value as a DID;
that must change before `scope: ["profile"]` is exposed.

### Hashtag Search

For hashtag queries, `scope: ["profile"]` searches
`homeSpaceCell.defaultPattern.profile.elements`.

Matching follows the favorites behavior:

1. `userTags` exact match, lowercased, without `#`
2. `tag` hashtag match using the existing hashtag extractor

The result maps each matching `ProfileElement` to `element.cell`, then applies
the query path suffix the same way favorites and mentionables do.

Examples:

```tsx
// Search profile elements only.
const profileCard = wish({ query: "#profile-card", scope: ["profile"] });

// Search favorites, current space, and profile elements.
const person = wish({
  query: "#person",
  scope: ["~", ".", "profile"],
});
```

Search order for mixed scopes is:

1. favorites (`"~"`)
2. current-space mentionables (`"."`)
3. profile elements (`"profile"`)
4. explicit DID spaces, in caller-provided order

This preserves existing favorites-first behavior and makes profile an explicit
extension rather than a new default.

### Well-Known Profile Targets

`wish({ query: "#profile" })` resolves to the current user's profile default
pattern.

Add these explicit profile targets:

```tsx
wish({ query: "#profile" })            // homeDefault.profile
wish({ query: "#profileSpace" })       // the profile space cell, derived from the profile link
wish({ query: "#profileName" })        // homeDefault.profileName, then profile.initialNameApplied
wish({ query: "#profileAvatar" })      // homeDefault.profile.avatar
wish({ query: "#profileBio" })         // homeDefault.profile.bio (CT-1648)
```

The optional `[UI]` for `wish({ query: "#profile" })` is persona-aware:

- when the profile exists, render a link to the profile default pattern
- when the profile is missing, render the same profile-name input as the home
  profile tab through the trusted profile-create pattern surface
- submitting the input creates the profile through the home default pattern but
  does not navigate away from the current view
- the wish UI should then reactively replace itself with the profile link once
  `homeDefault.profile` is written

If the old learned-summary shortcut remains useful, it should get a new explicit
target instead of overloading `#profile`.

## Integration Test Plan

Add a browser integration test with a demo pattern.

### Demo Pattern

Create a small test/demo pattern that renders the current user's shared profile
name and profile wish UI:

```tsx
export default pattern(() => {
  const profile = wish({ query: "#profile" });
  const name = wish<string>({ query: "#profileName" });
  return {
    [NAME]: "Profile Name Demo",
    [UI]: (
      <div>
        <div>{name.result ?? "No profile"}</div>
        <div>{profile}</div>
      </div>
    ),
  };
});
```

The test should assert both states:

1. before profile creation, the demo renders the missing-profile state and the
   inline profile creation input from `wish({ query: "#profile" })[UI]`
2. after profile creation and name entry, the demo renders the profile name
   and the profile wish UI renders a link to the profile

### Browser Flow

The integration test should:

1. create a fresh browser identity
2. navigate to a fresh ordinary space
3. add or open the demo pattern
4. assert the demo has no profile name yet
5. submit the profile name through the demo's inline profile wish UI
6. assert the rendered text is the profile name
7. assert the inline profile wish UI has reacted into a profile link
8. optionally create a second ordinary space with the same identity and assert
    the same profile name renders there too
9. for multi-user coverage, log in as a second identity against the same
    shared ordinary space/piece, create that user's profile, and assert the demo
    renders the second user's name without changing the first user's profile

The test should use the existing shell integration harness style from
`packages/patterns/integration/default-app.test.ts`, including fresh noble
identities and `waitForRuntimeIdle` before assertions. The CFC browser helpers
already provide useful primitives such as `waitForText`, `fillCfInput`, and
`waitForRuntimeIdle`; the CFC group-chat integration tests show the existing
shape for switching identities while keeping a shared piece under test.

### Runner-Level Tests

Add focused runner tests for `wish()`:

- `scope: ["profile"]` is not treated as a DID
- profile hashtag search reads `homeSpaceCell.defaultPattern.profile`
- mixed scope ordering is stable
- missing profile link returns an empty/error `WishState` without throwing out
  of the scheduler action
- `wish({ query: "#profile" })` returns the profile default pattern

## Open Questions

- Should profile spaces be readable by all collaborators by default, or private
  until explicitly shared?
- Should the profile default pattern expose `elements` only, or also a
  default-app-compatible `addPiece` stream for reuse?
- Should avatar be a string permanently, or should the first implementation
  reserve a future blob shape?
- How should a user intentionally reset or migrate their profile space if the
  home-space link points to a broken or obsolete profile?
