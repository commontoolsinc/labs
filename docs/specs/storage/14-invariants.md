# Invariants (Plugin API)

Invariants are **pluggable validators** that run **after** heads/dependency
validation but **before** the transaction commits. They can enforce **business
rules, security constraints, and integrity checks** across all docs in a
transaction.

## Interface

```ts
type Invariant = (ctx: {
  txIdPreview: number | null; // Assigned if commit proceeds
  reads: ReadSet[];
  writes: WriteSet[]; // includes decoded change metadata
  loadDocAt: (
    docId: string,
    branch: string,
    epoch?: number,
  ) => Promise<AutomergeDoc>;
  project: (doc: AutomergeDoc, paths: string[]) => any;
}) => Promise<void>;
```

- `loadDocAt` can retrieve a doc at:

  - Current heads.
  - A prior epoch.
- `project` returns a JSON projection of selected paths.

If any invariant throws an error, the transaction **fails closed** with:

```json
{ "code": "InvariantFailed", "name": "PolicyName", "message": "Details..." }
```

## Examples

- **Information Flow Control** — Ensure writes don't downgrade confidentiality
  labels.
- **Schema Validation** — Confirm updated doc conforms to server-side schema.
- **Temporal Constraints** — E.g., `timestamp` in doc can't move backward.
- **Cross-Doc Integrity** — Ensure derived data is based on equal-or-newer
  source data.

## Digest-Based Read Assertions (Optional)

For high-integrity claims about "what was read":

1. **Client** includes:

   - Heads observed for each `(doc, branch)` in `reads`.
   - Optional `path_digests` = `{ path: digest }` for selected subtrees.
2. **Server**:

   - Loads doc at those heads.
   - Projects each path, recomputes digest (e.g., BLAKE3 over CBOR encoding).
   - Compares with asserted digest.
3. Invariant passes only if all digests match.

## Execution & Fail-Closed Policy

- All invariants must pass for the transaction to commit.
- Failures abort the entire transaction atomically — no partial writes.
- Invariants run inside the same DB transaction to ensure **read consistency**.
