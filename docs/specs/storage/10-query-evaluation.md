# Query Evaluation Algorithm

## Single Run Evaluation

Function `evaluate(IR, docId, path: string[], linkBudget, refDepth = 0)`:

1. **Check memo** by `EvalKey`; if present, return cached `EvalResult`
2. **Link-aware path normalization** at `(docId, path)` where `path` is an array
   of strings:
   - Walk the path tokens left-to-right, reading the current value at each
     intermediate `(docId, subpath)`.
   - If an intermediate value is a link, follow it immediately (subject to the
     remaining `linkBudget`) and continue consuming the remaining path tokens on
     the target document/path.
   - Record touches for every intermediate `(docId, subpath)` actually read
     while normalizing, including the final resolved `(docId, path)` pair.
   - Decrement `linkBudget` for each link hop taken during normalization.
   - If a link points to another space, do not follow; normalization stops and
     evaluation proceeds locally for the remainder of the path.
   - If `linkBudget == 0` when a hop is required, stop normalization and treat
     the current value as a leaf; evaluation may yield `MaybeExceededDepth`.
   - After normalization, refer to the resulting `(docId, path)` as the
     normalized location for subsequent steps.
3. **Read current JSON value** at the normalized location:
   - For `/` or empty path, evaluate against `doc.value`.
   - If `doc.value` is undefined, the document has no current value.
4. **Apply local constraints** (`TypeCheck`, `Const`, etc.). Early exit to `No`
   if they fail.
5. **For Props on objects**:
   - **Required**: if missing → `No` (touch the missing property link)
   - For each known property in `props`, recursively evaluate child IR at
     subpath; collect deps, touches
   - **AP omitted/false**: do not enumerate or read other properties → no
     dependency on them
   - **AP true**: enumerate other properties; for each, either accept (if AP is
     `true`) or recurse into AP schema
6. **For Items on arrays**: enumerate items as needed (touches for indices read)
7. **For AnyOf / AllOf**:
   - Evaluate branches **in parallel** conceptually, but with memoization it's
     just multiple recursive calls
   - `allOf`: conjoin verdicts; `anyOf`: disjoin verdicts
   - A single `Yes` in `anyOf` can short-circuit further branches at runtime,
     but we still keep the provenance for any branches we _actually started_
8. **Link follow at value nodes**:
   - If the current value itself (post-normalization) is a link and the context
     requires exploring values (e.g., schema `true`), follow as above, consuming
     budget, and merge touches/deps.
   - Touches are recorded for nodes actually evaluated; encountering a link does
     not, by itself, record a touch for its target unless evaluation descends.
9. **Handle $ref nodes**:
   - If current IR node is `Ref(name)`:
     - Check if `refDepth > MAX_REF_DEPTH` (e.g., 100) to prevent infinite
       recursion
     - If exceeded, return `MaybeExceededDepth`
     - Else, resolve the definition IR node and recursively evaluate with
       `refDepth + 1`
10. **Source document tracking**:
    - If evaluating at document root (`path` is `/` or empty), check for
      `source` field
    - If `source` field exists and is a valid link, add the target document to
      the `sourceDocsToSync` set for this evaluation
    - This applies recursively: if the source document also has a `source`
      field, add that document as well
11. **Construct and store** `EvalResult` (verdict, touches, linkEdges, deps,
    sourceDocsToSync) in memo; also construct provenance edges:
    - Include provenance edges for all intermediate link hops observed during
      path normalization.

**Important**: because we watch only properties/array slots actually required by
IR and AP, plus intermediate paths followed during normalization, the **touch
set is minimal yet precise**.

## Invalidation & Incremental Maintenance

### On Document Change

Given a change event `Δ = { changedLinks, addedLinks, removedLinks }` for
`docId`:

1. **Find impacted EvalNodes**
   - For each changed `DocLink l`, get
     `impactedEvalNodes = ReverseIndex_DocLinkToEvalNodes[l]`
   - Mark them **dirty**

2. **Topologically re-evaluate** the dirty slice
   - Do a reverse BFS up the provenance graph: mark parents of dirty nodes dirty
     too
   - Process dirty nodes in topological order (children first)
   - For each dirty `EvalKey`, re-run `evaluate` (it will re-use unaffected memo
     entries below it)
   - For each re-evaluated node, compute **delta** of:
     - `verdict` (Yes/No/Maybe)
     - `touches` (add/remove DocLinks)
     - `linkEdges`
   - Update reverse indexes accordingly

3. **Find affected queries**
   - Any query that references a re-evaluated `EvalNode` or whose
     `QueryTouchSet` intersected `changedLinks` is **candidate**
   - For each candidate query, recompute just enough of its **root verdict** and
     **QueryTouchSet**:
     - If nothing changed → no notification
     - If either the **root verdict** changed or the **Touch Set** changed,
       **notify**
     - If the delta intersects the query (via dependency graph or touch
       containment), implementations SHOULD include the delta's `docId` in
       `changedDocs` for that notification to make the intersection explicit

4. **Link topology changes**
   - If a link was added/removed:
     - Update `incomingLinks`
     - Any `EvalNode` whose prior touches included the source link may now have
       new/deleted dependencies
     - Those nodes are marked dirty and step (2) handles the propagation

### On New Subscription

1. Compile (or look up) IR for the schema
2. Create `RootEvalKey`; run `evaluate` once
3. Compute `QueryTouchSet` as union of touches from `RootEvalKey`'s reachable
   slice (follow `deps`)
4. Register reverse indexes:
   - For every touched `DocLink`, add `(queryId)`
   - For every involved `EvalNode`, add `(queryId)`

### On Unsubscribe

1. Remove `(queryId)` from reverse indexes
2. Optionally GC: decrement **refcounts** of `EvalNodes` and prune
   memo/provenance subgraphs with zero refcount

## Overlapping Queries: Sharing & Dedup

- **IR hash-consing** gives identical schemas identical `IRNodeId`s
- `EvalKey` includes `IRNodeId`, so evaluating the same `(doc, path)` under the
  same schema is shared across all queries
- Reverse indexes attach **multiple queryIds** to the same `EvalNode` and
  `DocLink` dependencies
- For different schemas that still overlap structurally, you still benefit from
  sub-IR sharing

## Practical Heuristics

- **Branch ordering for anyOf**: evaluate cheaper / more selective branches
  first. Keep **profiling counters** per IR node
- **Touch set compression**: store DocLinks as trie-keys (docId + path segments)
  to dedupe ranges
- **Depth budget strategy**: If you frequently hit `MaybeExceededDepth`,
  consider:
  - A per-query **work queue** that explores one more link layer in idle time
  - Opportunistic deepening when related docs change

## Edge Cases  Correctness

- **Cycles**: handled by a per-evaluation visited set keyed by
  `(IRNodeId, docId, path)`. Re-entering the same key within a single evaluation
  short-circuits to prevent infinite recursion without emitting
  `MaybeExceededDepth`. The memo key includes
  `(docId, path, IRNodeId, linkBudget, refDepth)` to reuse results across calls.
- **Budget during path normalization**: each link hop taken while consuming path
  tokens decrements `linkBudget`. If the budget is exhausted mid-path, the
  remaining path is treated as unresolved and evaluation proceeds on the current
  value as a leaf, potentially yielding `MaybeExceededDepth`.
- **Provenance of intermediate paths**: touches include all intermediate
  `(docId, subpath)` inspected during normalization so changes at those points
  invalidate affected queries precisely.
- **"False but touch root"**: register a touch on `(docId, path)` even when
  schema is `False`.
- **Missing properties**: touching a missing property means watching its
  **existence bit**.
- **Arrays**: watch item indices you read; for AP-like "all items matter", you
  can represent **"all items under current array"** as a wildcard watch and
  expand lazily on change. expand lazily on change

## Complexity Notes

- Let `C` be number of changed links in a commit, `E` number of EvalNodes they
  feed into (via reverse index)
- Re-evaluation is **O(E + affected subgraph)**; with shared IR/memo and tight
  AP semantics, this is typically much smaller than "re-run all queries"
- Memory is largely in the **memo + provenance graph**; GC via refcounts and LRU
  for cold `EvalNodes`
