# Persistent Scheduler State Implementation Notes

## 2026-05-20 - Plan Checkpoint

- Branch: `codex/persistent-scheduler-state-spec`.
- Plan version: transaction-centric hybrid scheduler persistence with per-space
  mirrored read indexes.
- Initial assumptions:
  - scheduler observations are internal runtime state, not user-visible memory
    data
  - no-op observations are durable but do not create semantic memory revisions
  - the memory server records dirty/stale scheduler state but never executes
    actions
  - stable action identity starts from scheduler/action metadata and can be
    tightened when process graph snapshots become durable
- Known gaps to resolve during implementation:
  - exact durable action identity before full process graph snapshots exist
  - whether dirty/stale state needs per-cause rows instead of summary sequence
    fields
  - how far v1 rehydration can go without a persisted process graph snapshot
  - how to keep mirrored cross-space read index cleanup reliable after action
    replacement
- Validation so far: spec-only work, `git diff --check` passed before this
  implementation pass.
