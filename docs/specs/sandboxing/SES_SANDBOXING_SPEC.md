This document is the sole authoritative SES sandboxing specification for the
current reimplementation effort. It supersedes prior divergence notes and
branch-specific planning summaries.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This specification describes a security architecture for sandboxing untrusted
JavaScript execution in the Common Fabric pattern runtime using
**SES (Secure ECMAScript)**. The primary goal is not to trust an authored
pattern as a unit, but to ensure that each invocation of pattern-authored
callbacks is isolated from shared mutable module state except through trusted
Common Fabric abstractions. SES Compartments reduce ambient authority and limit
blast radius, but the primary enforcement mechanism is runtime verification and
hardening of module-scope definitions at load time.

### Key Principles

1. **Invocation Isolation**: Each callback invocation must be isolated from
   any other invocation except through trusted runtime abstractions such as
   `Cell`, `lift`, `handler`, and `pattern`.
2. **Verified Module Load**: Every top-level module item must be classified and
   verified before it may execute or become observable.
3. **Direct Callback Builders**: `pattern`, `lift`, `handler`, and
   similar trusted builders must receive direct callbacks, not IIFE-produced or
   otherwise computed callables.
4. **Safe Top-Level Functions**: Standalone top-level functions are allowed
   only when they are direct functions.
5. **Verified Module-Safe Data**: Any other top-level value must be proven to
   be a versioned, recursively inert subset of `StorableValue` and then
   hardened by a custom checker/freezer. Computing that value via an IIFE is
   allowed only if the final result passes this verifier. Transitional explicit
   snapshot helpers such as `safeDateNow()` and `nonPrivateRandom()` are
   allowed as narrow exceptions and return plain data.
6. **Compiler Assists, Runner Enforces**: Transformers may annotate or rewrite
   code to reduce runtime parsing cost, but compiler output is not trusted and
   the runner must verify the final code boundary.
7. **Per-Pattern Compartments Provide Containment**: The runtime uses one
   Compartment per loaded pattern to limit blast radius, while verification and
   hardening remain the primary enforcement mechanisms.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Current Architecture

The current execution pipeline:

```
Pattern Source (.tsx)
    ↓ ts-transformers (compile-time)
    ↓ js-compiler (TypeScript → AMD bundle)
    ↓ verified SES module Compartment
    ↓ instantiateJavaScriptNode() → fn(argument)
```

The legacy `UnsafeEvalIsolate` authored-module path has been removed. The
remaining security work is about tightening the verified SES boundary and the
callback rehydration path, not replacing `eval()` anymore.

### 2.2 Why SES?

SES (Secure ECMAScript) provides:
- **Frozen Intrinsics**: Built-in objects (Array, Object, etc.) are frozen
- **Compartments**: Isolated module graphs with controlled globals
- **Hardened APIs**: `harden()` to deeply freeze object graphs
- **Import Hooks**: Control over module resolution and loading

`harden()` is necessary but not sufficient for this threat model. It preserves
behavioral objects as-is, including functions and collection types whose
mutator methods remain live unless they are handled specially. This spec
therefore requires an additional runtime module-safe-data checker/freezer for
top-level non-function values.

Alternative considered: QuickJS (via `js-sandbox` package). SES is preferred because:
- Runs in the same V8/SpiderMonkey engine (no serialization overhead)
- Same JavaScript semantics (no edge cases)
- Can share frozen objects between Compartments without copying
- Better debugging experience (same DevTools)

### 2.3 Trust Model

Patterns are treated as untrusted code and may attempt to collude with
themselves across callbacks or invocations to route around the intended data
flow controls provided by trusted runtime abstractions.

The primary trust boundary is therefore:

- the verified set of module-scope bindings that survive module load
- the trusted builder/runtime capabilities injected by the platform
- the individual invocation of a verified callback

The following are **not** trusted:

- pattern source code
- compiled JavaScript output
- transformer or compiler rewrites
- arbitrary top-level closures or objects, even if later frozen

Compartments are still valuable, but as containment and ambient-authority
reduction rather than as the sole or primary trust boundary.

## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 High-Level Flow

```
Pattern Source (.tsx)
    ↓
[1] ts-transformers (enhanced)
    - Hoist lift/handler to module scope (when external references exist)
    - Rewrite inline derive → lift call
    - Emit optional verification hints for top-level items
    ↓
[2] js-compiler (existing)
    - TypeScript → AMD bundle with per-module AMD factories intact
    ↓
[3] Runtime Verifier (TCB)
    - Preflight the full compiled bundle before any evaluation
    - Inspect each AMD module factory before execution
    - Require direct callbacks for trusted builders
    - Permit direct top-level functions only
    - Route all other top-level values through module-safe-data verification
    - Reject anything else
    ↓
[4] SES Execution
    - Execute verified module factories in one Compartment per loaded pattern
    - Freeze verified top-level functions and exports
    - Expose only approved callable/data exports
    ↓
[5] Runner (modified)
    - Call frozen .implementation directly
    - No eval() per invocation
```

### 3.2 Compartment Lifecycle

│  │                                                       │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│                                                             │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ Future Dynamic Import Compartments (v2 only)          │  │
│  │  Not part of this implementation baseline             │  │
│  │                                                       │  │
│  │  If added later, each import must get fresh module    │  │
│  │  instantiation plus the same verification policy      │  │
│  │                                                       │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The primary enforcement mechanism is still verified module load plus hardened
exports, not the Compartment itself. The runtime nevertheless SHOULD use one
Compartment per loaded pattern as the default containment boundary, because that
reduces blast radius if verification misses something. Future dynamic-import
isolation may add fresh Compartments later, but authored pattern execution in
this baseline uses exactly one verified SES path.

## 4. Transformer Enhancements

### 4.1 Overview of Changes

The `ts-transformers` package requires the following enhancements:

| Transformation | Current Behavior | New Behavior |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| `computed(() => ...)` | → `derive({}, () => ...)` | → hoist `lift(...)` when the post-transform callback still depends on imports or module scope |
| `action(() => ...)` | → `handler((_, {}) => ...)({})` | → hoist `handler(...)` when the post-transform callback still depends on imports or module scope |
| inline `derive(input, fn)` | kept inline | → hoist `lift(...)` when the post-transform callback still depends on imports or module scope |
| `lift(...)` | allowed inline | **ERROR** if not at module scope |
| `handler(...)` | allowed inline | **ERROR** if not at module scope |
| module-scope calls | minimal validation | strict allowlist enforcement |

### 4.2 Module-Scope Verification Rules

At module scope, every surviving binding must fall into exactly one of the
following categories:

1. Trusted builder definitions with a **direct callback**
2. Direct top-level function definitions
3. Verified module-safe data that is hardened before exposure
4. Type-only and import/export declarations

Authored top-level class declarations are rejected in v1. They are neither
plain data nor trusted builders, and they create mutable prototype/static state
that violates the invocation-isolation goal. If class-like behavior is needed,
it must arrive through trusted runtime imports rather than authored module
scope.

All surviving top-level bindings should be normalized into a small canonical
wrapper language before trusted verification. The wrappers are not trusted on
their own; they exist so the verifier can recognize a tiny emitted grammar
instead of parsing arbitrary JavaScript.

#### 4.2.1 Trusted Builder Definitions

Trusted builders may only appear at module scope when their callback is direct.
A callback is "direct" when it is:

- an inline `function` expression
- an inline arrow function that the transformer normalizes to a `function`
  expression before verification
- an identifier that resolves to a direct top-level function definition that is
  itself normalized into the canonical function wrapper form

The following are allowed:

```typescript
import { pattern, lift, handler } from "commonfabric";

export const MyPattern = pattern<Input, Output>((props) => {
  return { value: props.value };
});

export const SecondaryPattern = pattern<Input, Output>((props) => {
  return { value: props.value };
});

export const myLift = lift<Input, Output>((input) => {
  return transform(input);
});

export const myHandler = handler<Event, State>((event, state) => {
  return newState;
});
```

The following are rejected:

```typescript
const makeCallback = () => (input) => transform(input);

// ❌ Callback is computed, not direct
export const badLift = lift(makeCallback());

// ❌ Callback produced by an IIFE
export const badHandler = handler((() => (event, state) => state)());
```

In canonical emitted form, trusted builders should remain builder-shaped. Their
callbacks may be left inline when already direct, or hoisted to a hardened
binding when that makes verification simpler. For example:

```javascript
const __cfModuleCallback_1 = __cfHardenFn(function (input) {
  return transform(input);
});
const myLift = lift(inputSchema, outputSchema, __cfModuleCallback_1);
```

The trusted verifier must confirm both:

- the outer trusted-builder call is one of the expected canonical builder forms
- any hoisted callback wrapper is the expected canonical hardening wrapper
- the callback itself is syntactically direct (`function` or arrow), not an
  arbitrary expression that merely evaluates to a function

#### 4.2.2 Direct Top-Level Functions

Standalone top-level functions are allowed when they are direct function
declarations or direct function-valued initializers.

```typescript
function helperFunction(x: number): number {
  return x * 2;
}

const helper2 = (x: number): number => {
  return x * 2;
};
```

These function objects are hardened immediately after definition. The verifier
only needs to accept direct function forms here; they are not part of the
`__cfHelpers.__cf_data(...)` plain-data bucket.

#### 4.2.3 Verified Module-Safe Data

Any top-level value that is not a trusted builder definition or direct function
must be module-safe data and pass a custom checker/freezer before it survives
module load. This is the only category where an IIFE is acceptable.

```typescript
const CONFIG = freezeVerifiedPlainData({
  maxItems: 100,
  labels: ["a", "b"],
});

const LOOKUP = freezeVerifiedPlainData((() => {
  return {
    open: "Open",
    closed: "Closed",
  };
})());
```

Canonical emitted form:

```javascript
const LOOKUP = __cfHelpers.__cf_data((() => {
  return {
    open: "Open",
    closed: "Closed",
  };
})());
```

The verifier does not need to semantically interpret the body of a
`__cfHelpers.__cf_data(...)` initializer. It only needs to recognize the wrapper boundary
and confirm the call shape. The runtime helper then evaluates the initializer,
validates the value that survives module load, and freezes the surviving inert
snapshot.

Accessor-backed values are allowed as transient snapshot sources. Their getters
may run during one-time snapshot materialization, but the surviving exported
value must be a copied inert graph with no live accessor behavior remaining.
Proxy-backed snapshotting is intentionally narrower than normal plain-data
usage: authored SES compartments explicitly disable `Proxy`, so authored code
cannot construct new proxies in v1. However, the runtime snapshotter may still
accept proxy-backed host/runtime values that already exist and materialize them
once into inert data. That is a compatibility boundary, not an authored escape
hatch.

Direct ambient `Date.now()` and `Math.random()` are not relied upon as the
stable SES contract. Pattern authors should call `safeDateNow()` and
`nonPrivateRandom()` explicitly, and the verifier treats those helpers as
explicit narrow exceptions that yield plain data snapshots.

Version 1 of the allowed domain is a deliberate subset of
`@commonfabric/memory`'s `StorableValue`:

- `null`
- `undefined`
- `boolean`
- `number`
- `string`
- `bigint`
- arrays of allowed values
- plain object records whose string-keyed or symbol-keyed own data properties
  are allowed values
- exact intrinsic non-stateful `RegExp` instances (`global === false` and
  `sticky === false`)
- exact intrinsic `Map` instances whose keys and values are allowed values
- exact intrinsic `Set` instances whose elements are allowed values

Future widening of this set beyond the above, including temporal primitives or
other richer `StorableValue` members, requires an explicit spec revision and
validator version bump. The v1 verifier MUST NOT silently widen with upstream
`StorableValue` changes.

This boundary is about executable behavior and authority, not about forcing
author data into a JSON-like normal form. Sparse arrays, symbol keys, cyclic
graphs, reserved property names, non-finite numbers, and extra own data
properties are not security failures by themselves and MUST NOT be rejected
solely for shape reasons if the runtime can preserve and freeze them without
invoking user-defined behavior.

The default rejected domain includes:

- functions
- `Promise`
- `Error`
- `Date`
- class instances
- `Map` / `Set` subclasses
- platform capability objects

The required security property is about the surviving exported graph, not about
forbidding every transient effect that can happen while snapshotting it.
Trusted graph construction during active builder execution is allowed as part of
pattern assembly, and the current implementation may also trigger effects caused
by proxy traps/getters during `__cfHelpers.__cf_data(...)` snapshotting. This is accepted in
the current baseline, especially while ambient `fetch()` remains temporarily
available. The exported value that survives module load must still be copied and
inert.

For `Map` and `Set`, the checker/freezer must not rely on `harden()` alone.
The surviving value must have immutable collection semantics: mutators such as
`set`, `add`, `delete`, and `clear` must not remain usable on the object that
survives module load.

`__cfHelpers.__cf_data(...)` validates the result that survives module load, not the full
semantics of the computation that produced it. This is acceptable under the
current threat model because the sandboxing contract for this path is about the
surviving copied value rather than forbidding all transient effects during
snapshot evaluation.

#### 4.2.4 Type-Only Syntax

Type-only declarations remain allowed:

```typescript
type MyType = { name: string };
```

Import/export policy:

- static imports are allowed only from trusted runtime modules and from other
  modules in the same transformed-and-verified bundle
- trusted runtime capabilities are supplied through those runtime modules and
  the AMD `runtimeDeps` mechanism, not as ambient application globals
- external third-party static imports are rejected in v1
- exports should be normalized to simple local bindings plus explicit export
  wiring so the verifier does not need to accept the full surface of ESM export
  syntax
- non-trusted external module access is deferred to dynamic imports in v2

#### 4.2.5 Disallowed Module-Scope Forms

The following are rejected unless they are normalized into `__cfHelpers.__cf_data(...)`,
and the final escaping value passes module-safe-data validation:

```typescript
// ❌ Arbitrary call result at module scope
const result = someFunction();

// ❌ Callable produced by an IIFE
const helper = (() => (x: number) => x * 2)();

// ❌ Non-builder side effect at module scope
const data = fetchData();

// ❌ Await expressions (implies side effects)
const response = await fetch(url);

// ❌ Hidden mutability survives even behind const
const state = { count: 0 };
```

#### 4.2.6 Compiler Assistance and Trusted Verification

The compiler/transformer is not in the TCB. It may assist by:

- inserting stable sentinel comments before each top-level item
- rewriting trusted builders and data initializers into a small canonical
  grammar: direct top-level functions become `__cfHardenFn(...)`, trusted
  builders become canonical builder calls with direct or hoisted callbacks, and
  data initializers become `__cfHelpers.__cf_data(...)`
- rewriting candidate plain-data initializers into
  `freezeVerifiedPlainData(...)`
- hoisting inline callbacks to make direct-callback verification easier
- emitting those wrappers during compilation so source maps and stack traces
  continue to point back to authored source, rather than introducing wrappers at
  runtime

However, the runner must still verify the code that is about to execute. The
trusted verification boundary is two-stage:

- preflight the full compiled bundle before any `compartment.evaluate(...)`
  call, ensuring the outer wrapper contains only trusted boilerplate plus AMD
  `define(...)` registrations in the untrusted source region
- verify each AMD module factory before it can be required or executed

The AMD module factory remains the primary authored-code boundary because it
preserves per-module top-level structure better than the fully wrapped bundle
entrypoint.

The trusted verifier should be a recognizer for the canonical emitted grammar,
not a general JavaScript parser. It only needs to:

- locate top-level item boundaries using sentinel comments and balanced
  delimiter scanning
- handle strings, comments, and template literals correctly so delimiters line
  up
- confirm that each surviving top-level item matches one of the canonical
  wrapper forms or allowed import/export/type forms
- reject anything outside that mini-language

The trusted verifier does **not** need to understand arbitrary JavaScript AST
structure if the emitted grammar is kept small and canonical.

### 4.3 Hoisting Inline Transformations

Hoisting decisions are made against the post-transform builder form, not the
raw authored callback.

By the time this hoisting pass runs:

- `computed(...)` has already been rewritten to `derive(...)`
- `action(...)` has already been rewritten to `handler(...)(params)`
- closure lowering has already converted local closed-over values into explicit
  callback parameters / params objects where possible
- `mapWithPattern(...)` and `patternTool(...)` have already been expressed as
  inner-scope `pattern(...)` forms with explicit captures

The hoisting pass therefore only cares about what still crosses the callback
boundary after those rewrites: remaining free variables, imported symbols, and
module-scoped bindings.

Self-contained callbacks remain inline. A callback is self-contained when, after
the earlier rewrites, all referenced values are callback parameters or locals.
This is the default behavior, not merely an optimization.

**Detection criteria for leaving inline (no hoisting needed):**
- No remaining free variables after closure lowering
- No imported symbol references
- No module-scoped binding references
- No `this` references
- No `arguments` references
- No `eval` or `Function` calls

```typescript
// This stays inline (self-contained after normalization)
const doubled = derive(props.value, x => x * 2);

// This MUST be hoisted (still references module scope after normalization)
const doubled = derive(props.value, x => x * multiplier);
```

#### 4.3.1 Computed / Derive Hoisting Rule

**Before (current):**
```typescript
export const MyPattern = pattern<Input, Output>((props) => {
  const doubled = computed(() => props.value * 2);
  return { doubled };
});
```

**After transformation (current):**
```typescript
export const MyPattern = pattern<Input, Output>((props) => {
  const doubled = derive({}, () => props.value * 2);
  return { doubled };
});
```

If the post-transform derive callback is self-contained, it stays inline.

If the post-transform derive callback still references imports or module scope,
the transformer must hoist the builder factory, not the fully applied call.
This applies equally to nested builder callbacks introduced by helpers such as
`map(...)`, `mapWithPattern(...)`, or inline sub-`pattern(...)` creation. If
the post-transform callback still sees module-scoped bindings, it must be
lifted to module scope so verified evaluation can mint and register a stable
`implementationRef` for the real executable body.

Concretely:

- starting point: `derive(inputSchema, outputSchema, params, fn)`
- hoist target: `lift(inputSchema, outputSchema, fn)`
- original-site replacement: `hoistedLift(params)`

**After transformation (new, when hoisting is required):**
```typescript
// Hoisted to module scope
const __computed_1 = lift<{ value: number }, number>(
  ({ value }) => value * 2
);

export const MyPattern = pattern<Input, Output>((props) => {
  const doubled = __computed_1({ value: props.value });
  return { doubled };
});
```

The same rule applies to explicit `derive(...)` calls:

- if the post-transform callback is self-contained, keep `derive(...)` inline
- if it still depends on imports or module scope, hoist `lift(...)` and leave
  the application with `(params)` at the original location

#### 4.3.2 Action / Handler Hoisting Rule

**Before (current):**
```typescript
export const MyPattern = pattern<Input, Output>((props) => {
  const doSomething = action(() => {
    props.count = props.count + 1;
  });
  return { doSomething };
});
```

If the post-transform handler callback is self-contained, the inline
`handler(...)(params)` form may remain at the original location.

If the post-transform handler callback still references imports or module scope,
the transformer must hoist the builder factory, not the final bound result.
Any remaining nested handler-like callback with module-scoped free variables is
therefore a transformer bug. The runtime may rehydrate such a callback from
source as a fail-closed fallback, but verified execution must rely on the
hoisted, module-scoped callback form.

Concretely:

- starting point: `handler(eventSchema, stateSchema, fn)(params)`
- hoist target: `handler(eventSchema, stateSchema, fn)`
- original-site replacement: `hoistedHandler(params)`

**After transformation (when hoisting is required):**
```typescript
// Hoisted to module scope
const __action_1 = handler<void, { count: Cell<number> }>(
  (_, { count }) => {
    count.set(count.get() + 1);
  }
);

export const MyPattern = pattern<Input, Output>((props) => {
  const doSomething = __action_1({ count: props.count });
  return { doSomething };
});
```

#### 4.3.3 Pattern-Based Inner-Scope Forms

The `pattern(...)` forms created for `mapWithPattern(...)`,
`filterWithPattern(...)`, `flatMapWithPattern(...)`, and `patternTool(...)`
remain inner-scope constructs in this phase. They already carry their captures
explicitly and are not the target of the module-hoisting rule above.

**Before:**
```typescript
export const MyPattern = pattern<Input, Output>((props) => {
  const total = derive(props.items, items => items.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0));
  return { total };
});
```

For reactive collection methods, the current transformation remains:

- detect a reactive receiver
- rewrite `.map()` / `.filter()` / `.flatMap()` to the corresponding
  `*WithPattern(...)` form
- keep the generated `pattern(...)` callback inline with explicit params/captures

These transforms are driven by reactive receiver semantics, not by the
module-hoisting rule.

**After transformation:**
```typescript
const __derive_1 = lift<number[], number>(
  items => items.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
);

export const MyPattern = pattern<Input, Output>((props) => {
  const total = __derive_1(props.items);
  return { total };
});
```

## 5. SES Execution Details

The runtime uses one authoritative SES execution path for compiled pattern
modules:

- verify each AMD module factory before it can execute
- execute verified modules inside one Compartment per loaded pattern
- expose only verified exported builder objects to the runner

Fresh Compartment evaluation remains available only for the rare string-based
fallback path described in Section 5.4. It is not the normal invocation path.

### 5.1 Lockdown Configuration

The runtime uses a small `SandboxConfig` surface:

```typescript
export interface SandboxConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  debug: boolean;
  console?: Console;
}
```

Default config:

```typescript
function getDefaultSandboxConfig(): SandboxConfig {
  return {
    enabled: true,
    debug: false,
  };
}
```

Lockdown options are derived from `debug`:

```typescript
lockdown({
  errorTaming: debug ? "unsafe" : "safe",
  stackFiltering: debug ? "verbose" : "concise",
  overrideTaming: "severe",
  consoleTaming: "unsafe",
});
```

Notes:

- `overrideTaming: "severe"` remains the compatibility default.
- `mathTaming` and `dateTaming` should not be relied on as policy knobs in the
  reimplementation. In newer SES releases those options are gone; any future
  reintroduction of time/randomness helpers for authored code must be explicit
  and accompanied by call-site restrictions.

### 5.2 Compiled Bundle Evaluation

The AMD bundler emits a bundle whose evaluation result is a function expecting
runtime dependencies:

```typescript
type CompiledBundleEntrypoint = (
  runtimeDeps?: Record<string, unknown>,
) => {
  main: Record<string, unknown>;
  exportMap: Record<string, Record<string, unknown>>;
};
```

The verified runtime path evaluates that bundle inside the pattern's
Compartment:

```typescript
preflightCompiledBundle(compiledBundle);
const entrypoint = patternCompartment.evaluate(compiledBundle);
const result = entrypoint(runtimeDeps);
```

Important details:

- the bundle itself stays in AMD form until execution
- the runtime performs bundle preflight before any Compartment evaluation
- `Engine.evaluate()` is the authoritative execution boundary: compile-time
  verification may fail early, but execution must re-run verification before
  evaluating a bundle
- successful bundle verification may be memoized by bundle hash as a
  performance optimization only; it must not change the execution-boundary
  policy
- runtime capability injection happens explicitly through trusted AMD
  `runtimeDeps`
- after preflight, the verifier runs at the AMD module factory boundary before
  any factory may be required or executed
- authored AMD factories never receive a live loader capability: the trusted
  bundle tail may keep its internal `require`, but the authored factory
  parameter resolves to an inert throwing stub
- verifier rejection of direct `require()` usage is diagnostic hardening only;
  security must not depend on syntactically detecting every obfuscated path to
  `require`
- the harness uses the resulting `exportMap` to associate exported runtime
  values with their source `RuntimeProgram`
- the runtime preserves the existing bundle ABI unless there is a deliberate
  compiler change
- only verified exported builder objects are cached for later invocation

The bundle preflight step MUST confirm all of the following:

- the outer bundle still matches the trusted bundler ABI
- the untrusted source region contains only top-level `define(...)`
  registrations
- no other authored statements can execute before verified factories are
  registered
- the trailing return scaffolding matches the trusted bundle shape

For any cached export-based execution path, the minimal runtime-facing metadata
shape can stay small:

```typescript
interface FrozenExport {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly implementation: unknown;
  readonly patternId: string;
}

interface PatternCompartment {
  readonly patternId: string;
  readonly exports: Map<string, FrozenExport>;
  getExport(name: string): FrozenExport | undefined;
}
```

Source maps, source files, and display metadata belong in the error-mapping
layer rather than on every `PatternCompartment`.

### 5.3 Authority Surfaces

The runtime distinguishes two authority surfaces:

#### 5.3.1 Minimal Compartment Globals

Ambient Compartment globals for authored modules must stay intentionally narrow:

- SES intrinsics
- sandboxed `console`
- `harden`
- verifier/runtime helper bindings needed to realize canonical wrappers
- temporary compatibility forwarding for the current compatibility-global
  surface used by legacy importer/auth code paths:
  `fetch`, `Headers`, `Request`, `Response`, `structuredClone`,
  `TextDecoder`, `TextEncoder`, `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `atob`, `btoa`,
  and an explicit `Proxy = undefined`
- a frozen compartment `globalThis`, so authored code cannot rebind or extend
  installed global bindings

Ambient globals available to authored module code in v1 MUST NOT include:

- `Temporal`
- `secureRandom`
- `randomUUID`
- any host object that performs network, time, randomness, navigation, storage,
  or compilation effects immediately when called

When host constructors or functions from that compatibility surface are
forwarded into a Compartment, the runtime MUST freeze the actual forwarded
outer-realm value before installation. In particular, forwarded constructor
objects and their `.prototype` objects must be frozen before authored code can
observe them. This explicit host-realm hardening is part of the prototype
pollution defense for forwarded web APIs; it is not provided by SES
automatically.

The current implementation still forwards ambient `fetch` and its adjacent web
request globals as a migration shim. That shim is transitional and should be
removed once importer/auth flows are fully routed through runtime-managed
capabilities. While the shim exists, direct `fetch()` may still run during
authored module assembly or `__cfHelpers.__cf_data(...)` snapshotting, in addition to
deferred callback execution.

#### 5.3.2 Trusted Runtime Modules via `runtimeDeps`

Common Fabric capabilities are supplied as trusted AMD runtime modules registered
through the existing `runtimeDeps` bundle ABI. This is the primary way authored
code receives builder and graph-construction capabilities.

In the current implementation, the trusted runtime module identifiers are:

- `commonfabric`
- `commonfabric/schema`
- `turndown`
- `@commonfabric/html`
- `@commonfabric/builder`
- `@commonfabric/runner`

These runtime modules may export:

- module-scope trusted builder entrypoints: `pattern`, `lift`, `handler`,
  `action`, `derive`, `computed`
- callback-scope helper entrypoints such as `patternTool(...)`, which remain
  valid inside verified pattern callbacks but are not part of the module-scope
  trusted-builder allowlist
- cell constructors and helpers: `Cell`, `Writable`, `OpaqueCell`, `Stream`,
  `ComparableCell`, `ReadonlyCell`, `WriteonlyCell`, `cell`, `equals`
- graph-construction built-ins: `str`, `ifElse`, `when`, `unless`, `llm`,
  `llmDialog`, `generateObject`, `generateText`, `fetchData`, `fetchProgram`,
  `streamData`, `compileAndRun`, `navigateTo`, `wish`
- utilities and constants required for graph construction and schema handling

The important distinction is that these are graph-building or deferred runtime
constructors. They may be used during module load to build the frozen reactive
graph, but they do not directly perform host effects merely by being present as
imports. Host-visible effects happen later, under the runtime's node execution
model, not during authored module evaluation. `patternTool(...)` is the main
exception to the "usable during module load" shorthand here: it may be exported
by trusted runtime modules, but it is only allowed inside verified pattern
callbacks after the earlier pattern transforms. These imports are not valid
from within `__cfHelpers.__cf_data(...)` initializers.

Any shared value installed through `runtimeDeps` MUST be transitively hardened
before Compartment evaluation begins. The shared export graph exposed by a
trusted runtime module is reused across authored evaluations, so function
objects, namespace objects, and reachable shared helper objects must be
immutable at installation time. Mutable state may only be introduced through
explicit runtime-managed authorities returned later, not by mutating the shared
`runtimeDeps` export graph itself.

### 5.4 Smaller-Compartment String Rehydration

Untrusted authored pattern code normally reaches execution through the compiled
bundle preflight plus AMD-factory verification pipeline. The only exception is
the lazy rehydration of serialized nested-pattern or module implementations that
exist only as function strings when first invoked.

That path must use SES, but not the full pattern-load authority surface. It
must execute inside a smaller Compartment with:

- the same compatibility globals listed in Section 5.3.1, including the
  explicit `Proxy = undefined`
- function-producing source only: the normalized source may be a direct
  function declaration/expression or a function-producing expression such as an
  IIFE, but evaluating it must yield a function before invocation proceeds
- no AMD loader state
- no runtime-module dependency injection
- a direct `console` global only; internal runtime hook globals such as
  `RUNTIME_ENGINE_CONSOLE_HOOK` are not part of the authored surface
- no shared mutable state other than explicit trusted runtime objects passed in

The runtime may cache a zero-argument creator per normalized function source as
a performance optimization, but each callback invocation must still
materialize a fresh function object/closure before it is called. Creator caching
is allowed; closure-state reuse across invocations is not.

A standalone `evaluateStringSync()` utility may still exist for trusted
internal tooling or diagnostics, but it is outside this threat model and MUST
NOT be used as a general authored-module execution path.

---

## 6. Dynamic Imports (Deferred)

Dynamic import support is not part of this implementation baseline.

Normative v1 behavior:

- no import-hook implementation is assumed or required for this baseline
- authored `import()` remains unavailable because the default SES compartment
  configuration rejects the syntax
- the escape-hatch and threat-model analysis must treat dynamic imports as
  unavailable, not controlled

Future v2 requirements, if dynamic imports are reintroduced:

1. each import must get fresh module instantiation so no state leaks between
   invocations
2. fetched modules must be verified under an equivalent policy before execution
3. downloaded code may be cached only if that caching does not weaken isolation
4. the import-hook implementation should live in a dedicated sandbox subsystem,
   likely under `packages/runner/src/sandbox/`

---

## 7. Closure Prevention Strategy

### 7.1 The Closure Problem

Closures can capture references to user data, leaking it between invocations:

```typescript
// DANGEROUS: Closure captures `userData`
let userData: any;

export const BadPattern = pattern((props) => {
  userData = props.secretData;  // Captured!

  return {
    leak: () => userData  // Later invocation can access previous user's data!
  };
});
```

### 7.2 Prevention Mechanisms

#### 7.2.1 No Module-Scope Mutations

The verifier enforces that surviving module-scope bindings:
- Are only assigned at declaration time
- Are never reassigned
- Are const (not let/var)
- Are either trusted direct functions or verified module-safe data

```typescript
// ❌ REJECTED: let at module scope
let counter = 0;

// ❌ REJECTED: Hidden mutability behind const
const config = {};
config.key = "value";

// ✅ ALLOWED: verified module-safe data
const CONFIG = freezeVerifiedPlainData({ key: "value" });
```

#### 7.2.2 Pattern/Recipe Inner Functions Run at Load Time

When `pattern()` is called, the inner function executes immediately:

```typescript
export const MyPattern = pattern((props) => {
  // This code runs at LOAD TIME, not invocation time
  // At load time, `props` is a schema placeholder, not user data
  return { ui: <div>{props.name}</div> };
});
```

At load time:
- `props` is a reactive schema placeholder
- No actual user data is available
- The return value defines the reactive graph

At invocation time:
- The reactive graph is already frozen
- User data flows through the frozen graph
- No new closures are created

#### 7.2.3 Function Hardening Is Necessary but Not Sufficient

All approved top-level functions and builder implementations are frozen after
load. In this spec, that hardening works together with the stricter top-level
grammar: surviving module-scope values are direct functions, trusted builder
definitions, or module-safe data.

#### 7.2.4 Custom Module-Safe Data Checker/Freezer

This spec introduces a runtime helper dedicated to non-function top-level
values:

```typescript
interface ModuleSafeRecordV1 {
  [key: string]: ModuleSafeValueV1;
  [key: symbol]: ModuleSafeValueV1;
}

type ModuleSafeValueV1 =
  | null
  | undefined
  | boolean
  | number
  | string
  | bigint
  | ModuleSafeValueV1[]
  | ModuleSafeRecordV1
  | ReadonlyMap<ModuleSafeValueV1, ModuleSafeValueV1>
  | ReadonlySet<ModuleSafeValueV1>;

function assertPlainData(
  value: unknown,
  path = "<root>",
): asserts value is ModuleSafeValueV1;

function freezeVerifiedPlainData<T>(value: T): T {
  return snapshotAndHardenModuleSafeData(value);
}
```

The type sketch above is illustrative rather than exhaustive for JavaScript
edge cases. Runtime acceptance may still include cyclic graphs, sparse arrays,
symbol-keyed properties, extra own data properties, and non-finite numbers so
long as the surviving value remains inert and freezable.

`assertPlainData()` and `freezeVerifiedPlainData()` validate the value that
survives module load, not a JSON-normalized subset of JavaScript. The checker
or freezer MAY materialize ordinary property reads and collection iteration
while constructing the final inert snapshot. In particular, the implementation
must:

- allow accessors and proxies only by evaluating them as part of the one-time
  snapshot that escapes module load
- reject any object whose runtime kind is neither a plain object, an array, an
  exact intrinsic `Map`, nor an exact intrinsic `Set`
- recursively validate `Map` keys and values and `Set` values
- reject intrinsic `RegExp` instances whose `global` or `sticky` flags make
  `lastIndex` observable mutable state
- reject any `StorableValue` members outside the approved v1 subset
- allow shape-level cases such as sparse arrays, symbol keys, cycles, reserved
  property names, non-finite numbers, and extra own data properties if the
  surviving snapshot is inert

`freezeVerifiedPlainData()` MUST preserve the accepted `Map` / `Set` contents
while removing mutability from the surviving collection object. A plain
`harden(new Map(...))` or `harden(new Set(...))` is insufficient because those
mutators remain callable. The freezer MAY preserve sparse arrays, symbol-keyed
properties, cyclic graphs, non-finite numbers, reserved property names, and
extra own data properties; those are semantic/storage concerns, not sandboxing
concerns, so long as the resulting graph is inert. Accessor properties may be
materialized into data properties. Proxy-backed values may be accepted only as
one-time host/runtime snapshot sources; authored SES compartments still keep
`Proxy` unavailable, so patterns do not gain a general proxy capability. Any
proxy-backed snapshot that survives module load must satisfy the same inert-data
rules as ordinary plain objects.

The verifier may allow a top-level expression to compute data via an IIFE, but
only if the value that escapes module load passes `assertPlainData()` and is
then hardened.

#### 7.2.5 Constrained String Execution for Lazy Nested Patterns

Most authored pattern code must enter through the compiled-bundle preflight plus
AMD-factory verification pipeline. However, lazily invoked nested-pattern and
module implementations may still exist only as serialized function strings at
the point they are first called.

That secondary path is allowed only under all of the following constraints:

- it evaluates only function-producing source, not arbitrary module/program
  strings; direct functions and IIFE-produced callables are allowed so long as
  the evaluation result is a function
- it runs inside a smaller SES Compartment than the main pattern-load path
- that smaller Compartment intentionally reuses the same compatibility-global
  surface as the main authored module Compartment while still omitting AMD
  loader state and runtime-module injection
- it must not expose AMD loader hooks, runtime-module injection, or host
  capabilities beyond the minimal callback invocation surface
- it exposes `console` only as an approved global and does not expose internal
  runtime globals such as `RUNTIME_ENGINE_CONSOLE_HOOK`
- it may cache a source-specific creator function, but each invocation must
  create a fresh callable/closure from that creator before running user code
- it must not share mutable module-scope state across independently evaluated
  string-backed implementations except through explicit trusted runtime objects

A fresh Compartment utility may still exist for trusted internal tooling, but
the lazy string-backed callback path above is the only authored-code exception
to the main verified-bundle entry rule.

---

## 8. Error Handling and Source Map Integration

Debugging sandboxed code presents unique challenges. This section details how to maintain a good developer experience while running code in SES Compartments.

### 8.1 Current Error Strategy

The live SES runtime uses `errorTaming: 'safe'` and reconstructs host-visible
stack frames after an exception crosses the Compartment boundary. In practice:

- guest code does not receive raw unsafe stack objects from SES
- the host uses SES's stack-string utility to materialize frames after the
  throw
- those frames are then source-map translated back to original authored source

This preserves source locations for debugging without switching the authored
module Compartment to globally unsafe error taming.

### 8.2 The Source Map Challenge

Even with recovered host-visible stack frames, traces point to
**compiled/transformed code** until source maps are applied:

```
Original TypeScript (MyPattern.tsx)
        ↓
    [ts-transformers]  ← Hoisting changes line numbers
        ↓
    [js-compiler]      ← TypeScript → JavaScript
        ↓
    [AMD bundling]     ← Wraps in AMD loader
        ↓
Executed in Compartment
```

#### Example: Line Number Mismatch

**Original source (MyPattern.tsx:23):**
```typescript
export const MyPattern = pattern((props) => {
  const doubled = computed(() => props.value.map(x => x * 2));  // Line 23
  return { doubled };
});
```

**After transformation (compiled.js:5, 47):**
```javascript
// Hoisted to line 5
const __computed_1 = lift(({ value }) => value.map(x => x * 2));

// Original location now at line 47
export const MyPattern = pattern((props) => {
  const doubled = __computed_1({ value: props.value });
  return { doubled };
});
```

**Error without source mapping:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
    at __computed_1 (eval:5:45)  // Points to compiled code!
```

**Error with source mapping:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
    at computed callback (MyPattern.tsx:23:42)  // Points to original!
    └─ (hoisted to __computed_1)
```

### 8.3 Source Map Preservation Strategy

#### 8.3.1 Compilation Pipeline Source Maps

Each stage produces and consumes source maps:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Original Source                                              │
│ MyPattern.tsx                                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ts-transformers                                              │
│ Input:  MyPattern.tsx                                        │
│ Output: MyPattern.transformed.tsx + sourceMap1               │
│                                                              │
│ sourceMap1: transformed line 5 → original line 23           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ js-compiler (TypeScript)                                     │
│ Input:  MyPattern.transformed.tsx + sourceMap1               │
│ Output: MyPattern.js + sourceMap2                            │
│                                                              │
│ sourceMap2: JS line N → transformed line M                   │
│ (TypeScript compiler can chain source maps)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AMD Bundler                                                  │
│ Input:  MyPattern.js + sourceMap2                            │
│ Output: bundle.js + sourceMap3 (merged)                      │
│                                                              │
│ sourceMap3: bundle line P → original line Q                  │
│ (Merged/chained through all stages)                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 8.3.2 Transformer Source Map Generation

The hoisting transformer must generate accurate source maps:

```typescript
// packages/ts-transformers/src/hoisting.ts

class HoistingTransformer {
  private sourceMapGenerator: SourceMapGenerator;

  visitComputedCall(node: ts.CallExpression): ts.Expression {
    const originalPos = this.sourceFile.getLineAndCharacterOfPosition(
      node.getStart()
    );

    const hoistedName = `__computed_${this.counter++}`;

    // Record mapping: hoisted location → original location
    this.sourceMapGenerator.addMapping({
      generated: { line: this.hoistedLineNumber, column: 0 },
      original: { line: originalPos.line + 1, column: originalPos.character },
      source: this.sourceFile.fileName,
      name: hoistedName,
    });

    // ... create hoisted node ...
  }
}
```

#### 8.3.3 js-compiler Source Map Chaining

The existing js-compiler already supports source maps. Ensure chaining:

```typescript
// packages/js-compiler/typescript/compiler.ts

const compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions = {
  // ... existing options ...
  sourceMap: true,
  inlineSources: true,  // Include original source in map
  inlineSourceMap: false,  // Keep separate for chaining
};

// When transformer provides input source map, chain them
if (inputSourceMap) {
  // Use source-map library to merge
  const merged = await mergeSourceMaps(inputSourceMap, outputSourceMap);
  return { js, sourceMap: merged };
}
```

### 8.4 Error Mapping Implementation

#### 8.4.1 Shared Source-Map State

Error mapping is synchronous and centered on
`@commonfabric/js-compiler`'s `SourceMapParser`, but SES must **reuse** the same
runtime-owned source-map state shape that already exists in the current harness
rather than introducing a second parallel `ErrorMapper` object model.

The existing shared surface is the right baseline:

```typescript
interface StackMapper {
  loadSourceMap(filename: string, sourceMap: SourceMap): void;
  mapPosition(
    filename: string,
    line: number,
    column: number,
  ): MappedPosition | null;
  parseStack(stack: string): string;
  clear(): void;
}
```

Implementation guidance:

- keep `SourceMapParser` ownership on the runtime / isolate / sandbox instance,
  not on individual errors
- keep the source-map and stack-materialization helper shared across the SES
  module runtime and the narrower callback-compartment runtime, rather than
  duplicating parsing/caching behavior in each call path
- source maps are loaded by filename into the shared mapper and do not need to
  live on every `PatternCompartment`
- the same mapper supports direct `parseStack()` and `mapPosition()` calls for
  both the module-load and lazy-callback SES paths
- after source-map parsing, runner-internal SES plumbing frames should collapse
  to `<CF_INTERNAL>` so user-facing errors show authored code first without
  leaking harness implementation details

#### 8.4.2 ErrorMappingOptions and MappedError

```typescript
interface ErrorMappingOptions {
  readonly debug?: boolean;
  readonly patternId?: string;
  readonly sourceMap?: SourceMap;
  readonly filename?: string;
}

interface MappedError {
  readonly originalError: Error;
  readonly mappedStack: string;
  readonly frames: readonly ClassifiedFrame[];
  readonly patternLocation?: SourceLocation;
  readonly userMessage: string;
}
```

Required behavior:

- if `filename` and `sourceMap` are present, the shared mapper loads that map
  before parsing the stack
- `mappedStack` is the formatted post-classification stack shown to users or
  logs
- `patternLocation` comes from the first `pattern` frame after classification
- `userMessage` is preformatted so callers do not need to rebuild a concise
  display string

The synchronous helper must operate on the shared mapper rather than allocate a
fresh mapper per error:

```typescript
function mapError(
  mapper: StackMapper,
  error: Error,
  options: ErrorMappingOptions = {},
): MappedError {
  if (options.filename && options.sourceMap) {
    mapper.loadSourceMap(options.filename, options.sourceMap);
  }

  return classifyAndFormatMappedError(mapper, error, options);
}
```

`mapError()` is therefore a pure formatter/classifier over runtime-owned mapper
state. It must not instantiate a new `SourceMapParser`, `ErrorMapper`, or other
per-call cache container.

#### 8.4.3 Execution Wrappers

Execution wrappers are required for both sync and async pattern callbacks:

```typescript
interface ExecutionWrapperOptions {
  readonly patternId: string;
  readonly functionName?: string;
  readonly includeStack?: boolean;
  readonly debug?: boolean;
  readonly mapper: StackMapper;
}

class PatternExecutionError extends Error {
  readonly patternId: string;
  readonly functionName?: string;
  readonly originalError: Error;
  readonly sourceLocation?: SourceLocation;

  toUserMessage(): string { ... }
}

function wrapExecution<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(
  fn: T,
  options: ExecutionWrapperOptions,
): WrappedFunction<T> { ... }

function wrapAsyncExecution<T extends (...args: any[]) => Promise<any>>(
  fn: T,
  options: ExecutionWrapperOptions,
): WrappedFunction<T> { ... }
```

Required behavior:

- preserve `SandboxSecurityError` unchanged
- wrap all other thrown values in `PatternExecutionError`
- attach `patternId`, optional `functionName`, and best-effort `sourceLocation`
- include the original stack in debug mode
- expose `isPatternExecutionError()` and `getErrorMessage()` helpers for
  downstream callers

### 8.5 Debugging Experience

#### 8.5.1 Console Output

With proper error mapping, developers see:

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined

    at computed callback (MyPattern.tsx:23:42)
       └─ (originally: computed callback)
    at MyPattern (MyPattern.tsx:22:3)

     │                                          ^^^
  24 │   return { doubled };
```

#### 8.5.2 Enhanced Error Display

```typescript
// packages/runner/src/sandbox/error-display.ts

interface ErrorDisplayOptions {
  readonly verbose?: boolean;
  readonly colors?: boolean;
  readonly maxFrames?: number;
  readonly showFrameTypes?: boolean;
}

function formatError(
  mappedError: MappedError,
  options: ErrorDisplayOptions = {},
): string { ... }

function formatErrorForConsole(mappedError: MappedError): string { ... }
function formatErrorForLog(mappedError: MappedError): string { ... }
function formatUserMessage(mappedError: MappedError): string { ... }

interface ErrorReport {
  readonly message: string;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly patternId?: string;
  readonly location?: {
    readonly file: string;
    readonly line: number;
    readonly column: number;
  };
  readonly stack: string;
  readonly frameSummary: {
    readonly total: number;
    readonly pattern: number;
    readonly runtime: number;
    readonly external: number;
    readonly ses: number;
  };
}

function createErrorReport(
  mappedError: MappedError,
  patternId?: string,
): ErrorReport { ... }
```

### 8.6 Layered Stack Trace Filtering

The key insight is that **pattern authors and runtime developers have different needs**:

- **Pattern authors** need to see their code, but runtime internals are noise
- **Runtime developers** need to see everything when debugging the runtime itself

#### 8.6.1 Frame Classification

```typescript
// packages/runner/src/sandbox/frame-classifier.ts

type FrameType = "pattern" | "runtime" | "external" | "ses";

interface ClassifiedFrame {
  readonly original: string;
  readonly type: FrameType;
  readonly functionName?: string;
  readonly file?: string;
  readonly line?: number;
  readonly column?: number;
  readonly isMapped: boolean;
}

const RUNTIME_PATTERNS = [
  /\/runner\/src\//,
  /\/harness\//,
  /\/scheduler\//,
  /AMDLoader/,
  /<CF_INTERNAL>/,
  /\beval\b/,
];

const SES_PATTERNS = [
  /\/ses\//,
  /Compartment/,
  /lockdown/,
  /harden/,
  /@endo\//,
];

const EXTERNAL_PATTERNS = [
  /node_modules/,
  /npm:/,
  /esm\.sh/,
  /deno\.land/,
  /jsr\.io/,
];
```

In non-debug mode, filtering behavior should match the implementation:

- include all `pattern` frames
- include `external` frames
- include `runtime` frames only until the first `pattern` frame, to preserve
  call-site context
- exclude `ses` frames and later runtime-internal noise

#### 8.6.2 Filtered Stack Trace Output

  maxPatternFrames: number;    // limit depth, default unlimited
}

const DEFAULT_OPTIONS: StackFilterOptions = {

#### 8.6.4 Sandbox Configuration

```typescript
// packages/runner/src/sandbox/types.ts

export interface SandboxConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  debug: boolean;
  console?: Console;
}
```

The `debug` field controls both lockdown configuration (see Section 5.1) and
stack trace verbosity. When `debug` is true, full stack traces including runtime
and SES frames are shown.

### 8.7 Configuration Summary

| Audience | `debug` | Runtime Frames | Source Context |
|----------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Pattern Author | `false` | Hidden | Pattern source shown |
| Runtime Developer | `true` | Visible (marked) | All source shown |
| Production (logging) | `false` | Hidden | Included in logs |

## 9. Implementation Workstreams

### Phase 1: Non-TCB Compiler Assistance

#### 1.1 Emit top-level classification hints (Priority: High)

The transformer should help the runtime verifier without becoming trusted.
Examples:

- insert stable sentinel comments before each top-level item
- normalize direct top-level functions into canonical forms such as
  `__cfHardenFn(function ...)`
- normalize trusted builders into canonical builder calls such as
  `lift(inputSchema, outputSchema, fn)`
- normalize data bindings into canonical forms such as
  `__cfHelpers.__cf_data(expr)`
- rewrite module-safe-data candidates into `freezeVerifiedPlainData(...)` within the
  canonical data wrapper
- normalize export syntax to simple local bindings plus explicit export wiring

These hints are performance aids only. The runner must be able to reject the
module even if the hints are wrong or missing.

**Files to modify:**
- `packages/ts-transformers/src/transformers/module-scope-validation.ts`
- `packages/ts-transformers/src/hoisting/*`
- compiler pipeline entrypoints that preserve the hints into emitted JS

#### 1.2 Hoist computed/action/derive when useful (Priority: High)

Continue to hoist only when the post-transform builder callback still depends on
imports or module scope. Earlier closure-lowering passes already internalize
many local captures, so this pass is specifically about remaining external
references after normalization.

The hoist target must be the builder factory:

- `derive(inputSchema, outputSchema, params, fn)` hoists as
  `lift(inputSchema, outputSchema, fn)` and leaves the `(params)` call in place
- `handler(eventSchema, stateSchema, fn)(params)` hoists as
  `handler(eventSchema, stateSchema, fn)` and leaves the `(params)` call in
  place

Generated `pattern(...)` forms for `*WithPattern(...)` and `patternTool(...)`
remain inner-scope transforms in this phase rather than becoming module-level
hoists.

### Phase 2: Trusted Runtime Verification at the AMD Module Boundary

#### 2.1 Preflight bundles and verify module factories before execution (Priority: High)

The trusted verifier should operate in two stages:

- preflight the full compiled bundle before any Compartment evaluation
- verify each AMD module factory before it can be required

This preserves per-module top-level structure while also preventing untrusted
compiler output from executing statements outside `define(...)` registrations.

The verifier must check:

- trusted builders receive direct callbacks only
- top-level functions are direct functions only
- all other surviving top-level values are module-safe data and hardened
- no unclassified top-level side effects survive

The verifier should be implemented as a minimal recognizer for the canonical
emitted wrapper grammar, not as a full JavaScript parser. The TCB scanner only
needs to:

- follow balanced `()`, `{}`, and `[]`
- correctly skip over strings, comments, and template literals
- split the factory body into top-level items
- match those items against the small set of canonical wrapper forms

If the output deviates from the canonical wrapper language, the verifier should
fail closed.

**Likely files:**
- `packages/js-compiler/typescript/bundler/bundle.ts`
- `packages/js-compiler/typescript/bundler/amd-loader.ts`
- `packages/runner/src/harness/engine.ts`
- new `packages/runner/src/sandbox/bundle-preflight.ts`
- new `packages/runner/src/sandbox/module-verifier.ts`

#### 2.2 Add custom module-safe-data checker/freezer (Priority: High)

Implement a runtime helper that proves a value is a versioned, recursively inert
subset of `StorableValue` and then hardens it. This helper is stricter than
`harden()` alone and stricter than Endo pass-style checks. It must reject
unsupported runtime kinds such as exotic/custom prototypes and non-approved
`StorableValue` members, preserve accepted `Map` / `Set` contents while
converting the surviving collection object to immutable semantics rather than
relying on `harden()` alone, and ensure that the value which escapes module
load is recursively inert. Shape-level cases such as cycles, symbol keys,
sparse arrays, reserved property names, non-finite numbers, and extra own data
properties are not sandbox failures by themselves. Accessors and proxies are
acceptable if they are only observed as part of constructing the final inert
snapshot that escapes module load.

**Likely files:**
- new `packages/runner/src/sandbox/plain-data.ts`
- `packages/runner/src/sandbox/mod.ts`
- `packages/memory/interface.ts` (contract reference only)
- tests under `packages/runner/test/sandbox/`

#### 2.3 Harden approved functions immediately after load (Priority: High)

Direct top-level functions and trusted builder implementations must be hardened
as soon as they are created. Hardening is not an execution grant. A hardened
host callback remains non-executable unless it is either:

- produced by the compiled SES verification/evaluation pipeline, or
- explicitly admitted through the runtime-scoped unsafe host trust API in
  Section 4.1.1

The spec does not require a helper-shaped encoding for direct top-level
functions. Implementations may harden them however they choose, provided the
verifier only needs to recognize direct top-level function forms. Trusted
builder implementations are hardened in the runtime builder layer as soon as
`lift(...)`, `handler(...)`, `pattern(...)`, or related constructors receive
them, but runner execution must still resolve those callbacks through the
verified or trusted-host registries rather than by invoking raw function
objects from the host graph. If a `javascript` module carries a function
implementation that has not been admitted into either registry, the runtime may
only execute it by re-evaluating its source inside the dedicated SES callback
Compartment described in Section 4.2. That fallback is not a blessing path and
must intentionally discard host closure state.

The compiled-bundle verifier also treats TypeScript's canonical default-import
normalization rebinding as part of the accepted grammar:
`local = __importDefault(local)` when `local` is already the AMD factory's
import binding for that dependency. This statement is a normalization step over
an already-verified import edge, not new capability acquisition.

Namespace-import normalization via `local = __importStar(local)` is
intentionally not supported in v1. That transform introduces additional
namespace-object surface that must be deliberately specified and hardened before
it becomes part of the accepted SES grammar. Future work may add support once
that hardening contract exists.

#### 2.4 Enforce import policy at verification time (Priority: High)

The verifier should explicitly distinguish:

- trusted static imports from runtime modules
- static imports from other transformed-and-verified local modules
- all other static imports, which are rejected in v1

External imports beyond the trusted runtime set should remain a v2 dynamic
import concern rather than a v1 load-time feature.

### Phase 3: SES Execution Path

#### 3.1 Implement one live runtime path (Priority: High)

Eliminate the split between parallel SES implementations. The runtime must have
one authoritative verified SES execution path.

#### 3.2 Use one Compartment per pattern while keeping verification primary (Priority: High)

The runtime should execute each loaded pattern in its own Compartment. That
Compartment is a containment boundary, not the primary mechanism that prevents
callback collusion. Future dynamic-import isolation may introduce additional
Compartments later. In v1, the only separate string-based path is the smaller
lazy-callback Compartment described in Section 5.4, not a general authored
module fallback.

#### 3.3 Minimal globals plus trusted runtime modules (Priority: Medium)

Keep ambient Compartment globals intentionally narrow and supply Common Fabric
capabilities through trusted runtime modules registered via `runtimeDeps`.
Future reintroduction of time/network/randomness helpers for authored code
remains a separate scoped decision.

#### 3.4 Runtime module provider and minimal globals

Build a new sandbox subsystem that separates:

- minimal ambient globals for Compartments
- trusted runtime-module exports registered through `runtimeDeps`

Initial implementation can migrate logic from the current harness runtime-module
surface, but the target module split should live under `packages/runner/src/sandbox/`.

**Likely files:**
- new `packages/runner/src/sandbox/runtime-modules.ts`
- new `packages/runner/src/sandbox/compartment-globals.ts`
- `packages/runner/src/harness/runtime-modules.ts` (migration source)

### Phase 4: Runner Integration

#### 4.1 Modify instantiateJavaScriptNode

Replace direct eval with the authoritative verified SES execution path:

```typescript
// packages/runner/src/runner.ts

private instantiateJavaScriptNode(
  tx: IExtendedStorageTransaction,
  module: JavaScriptModuleDefinition,
  ...
): void {
  let fn: Function;
  const patternId = this.runtime.patternManager.getPatternId(pattern);

  if (module.implementationRef) {
    fn = this.runtime.harness.getExecutableFunction(
      module.implementationRef,
      patternId,
    );
    if (!fn) {
      fn = rehydrateJavaScriptImplementationInCallbackCompartment(module);
    }
  } else {
    fn = rehydrateJavaScriptImplementationInCallbackCompartment(module);
  }

  const result =
    module.wrapper === "handler"
      ? fn(argument.$event, argument.$ctx)
      : fn(argument);
}
```

The runner must distinguish executable JavaScript implementations by origin:

- verified callbacks: produced by compiled-bundle verification plus SES module
  evaluation
- trusted-host callbacks: admitted explicitly through the unsafe host trust API
- SES-rehydrated callbacks: created lazily from string source or from
  `Function.prototype.toString.call(module.implementation)` inside the smaller
  callback Compartment
- all other raw host function execution on the host: forbidden

“Hardened” is not a third category. Freezing a host callback prevents mutation;
it does not prove provenance.

`implementationRef` is an identity token, not a blessing. Blessing happens only
when the runtime admits callbacks into an execution registry by traversing an
already-approved graph:

- after compiled SES evaluation, the harness walks exported values / pattern
  graphs and registers the `implementationRef -> function` pairs it finds
- when a previously verified pattern is registered into a different active
  harness, that harness must re-admit the discovered `implementationRef ->
  function` pairs into its verified-load registry for the associated
  `verifiedLoadId`, not only into a pattern-local side table
- during `unsafeTrustPattern(...)`, `unsafeTrustModule(...)`, or
  `createBuilder({ unsafeHostTrust })`, the runtime walks the trusted host graph
  and registers those callbacks into the trusted-host registry

Ambient construction context must not register callbacks into either registry.
Being created while a verified load is active is not sufficient.

**Files to modify:**
- `packages/runner/src/runner.ts`

#### 4.1.1 Explicit Unsafe Host Trust API

Some tests, legacy comparison harnesses, and other trusted in-process fixtures
construct patterns directly with host builder functions instead of compiling
authored source through CTS and the compiled-bundle verifier. Those fixtures are
outside the verified SES path and therefore must not become executable by
default.

The runtime may expose an explicit, runtime-scoped opt-in for those cases:

```typescript
const trust = runtime.createUnsafeHostTrust({
  reason: "unit test fixture",
});

const { commonfabric } = createBuilder({
  unsafeHostTrust: trust,
});
```

The builder option may recursively register the host-created pattern/module
graph with a trusted-host function registry as values are produced. Equivalent
direct helpers such as `runtime.unsafeTrustPattern(pattern, options)` or
`runtime.unsafeTrustModule(module, options)` are also allowed.

The unsafe host trust contract is:

- explicit at the callsite
- scoped to one runtime / harness instance
- non-serializable and not persisted into pattern metadata
- separate from the verified SES function registry
- auditable via a required non-empty reason string

This API exists only to admit already-trusted host fixtures. It must not become
an implicit fallback path when normal runner execution cannot find a verified
implementation reference. Without explicit trust, unblessed host callbacks may
still run only through SES source rehydration, which intentionally drops host
closure state and therefore fails closed for non-self-contained functions.

#### 4.2 Remove Legacy UnsafeEvalIsolate Usage

The runtime no longer exposes a live `unsafe-eval` authored-module path.
`harness.getInvocation()` still exists as an internal seam, but it now
delegates to SES function-source evaluation rather than `UnsafeEvalIsolate`,
and the rehydrated callback function is hardened before it is cached or invoked.
The runtime routes either:

- verified module load through the main SES module path, or
- lazy string-backed callback rehydration through the smaller SES callback
  Compartment described above.

For function-backed `javascript` modules that are not blessed through either
registry, the runner stringifies the function with
`Function.prototype.toString.call(...)` and rehydrates that source in the same
callback Compartment. Any missing lexical capture must therefore fail closed at
runtime rather than silently preserving host state.

```typescript
// Before
fn = this.runtime.harness.getInvocation(module.implementation);

// After
fn = evaluateInCallbackCompartment(module.implementation);
```

**Implemented in:**
- `packages/runner/src/harness/engine.ts`
- `packages/runner/src/sandbox/ses-runtime.ts`
- `packages/runner/test/runtime.test.ts`
- `packages/runner/test/stack-trace.test.ts`

### Phase 5: Dynamic Imports (Deferred)

Dynamic imports are not implemented in v1. The verifier should reject authored
`import()` expressions outright. If this scope is reopened later, it should
introduce a dedicated import-hook subsystem under `packages/runner/src/sandbox/`
and must preserve fresh-instantiation and verification guarantees.

### Phase 6: Testing & Hardening

## 10. Migration Guide

### 10.1 Pattern Author Changes

Most patterns will work without changes. The following patterns require updates:

#### Patterns with module-scope side effects

**Before (breaks):**
```typescript
const startTime = Date.now();  // Side effect at module scope
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { safeDateNow } from "commonfabric";

const getStartTime = lift(() => safeDateNow());
```

#### Patterns with mutable module-scope state

**Before (breaks):**
```typescript
let counter = 0;
export const MyPattern = pattern(() => {
  counter++;
  return { count: counter };
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Use Cell for state
export const MyPattern = pattern(() => {
  const counter = cell(0);
  const increment = handler(() => counter.set(counter.get() + 1));
  return { count: counter, increment };
});
```

### 10.2 Runtime API Changes

```typescript
// Before
const resultCell = runtime.getCell(space, "pattern-result");
const runner = new Runner(runtime);
await runner.setup(undefined, pattern, inputs, resultCell);
await runner.start(resultCell);

// After (if explicit lockdown control needed)
SESRuntime.applyLockdown({ enabled: true, debug: false });
const resultCell = runtime.getCell(space, "pattern-result");
const runner = new Runner(runtime);
await runner.setup(undefined, pattern, inputs, resultCell);
await runner.start(resultCell);
```

## 11. Security Considerations

### 11.1 Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Arbitrary code execution | Bundle preflight, AMD-factory verification at the execution boundary, SES Compartments, and controlled runtime-module injection |
| Collusion between callbacks in the same pattern | Runtime module verifier, direct-callback enforcement, and verified module-safe-data freezing |
| Compiler/transformer compromise | Runner-side bundle preflight plus AMD-factory verification |
| AMD loader hook abuse | Authored `require` is inert at runtime; verifier rejection is defense in depth |
| Global pollution | Frozen intrinsics, controlled globals |
| Internal runtime-global exposure | Only approved globals are installed; implementation hooks like `RUNTIME_ENGINE_CONSOLE_HOOK` stay hidden |
| Prototype pollution | SES-frozen intrinsics plus explicit freezing of forwarded host constructor/prototype pairs before installation |
| Closure-based data leakage | No surviving mutable module bindings; direct-function-only top-level forms plus function hardening |
| State leakage via modules | Verified immutable top-level bindings, hardened shared `runtimeDeps` exports, and dynamic imports rejected in v1 |
| Resource exhaustion | Future: Add CPU/memory limits (not in this spec) |
| Ambient network/time/random authority at module load | Narrow Compartment globals; temporary compatibility web-fetch shim only, no `Temporal`, `secureRandom`, or `randomUUID` |

### 11.2 Known Limitations

1. **No CPU limits**: Infinite loops will still hang. Future work: Integrate with QuickJS for CPU limits or use Web Workers with timeouts.

2. **No memory limits**: Memory exhaustion possible. Future work: Monitor heap usage.

3. **No egress policy on runtime-managed network nodes**: `fetchData()`,
   `fetchProgram()`, and `streamData()` remain allowed graph constructors and
   may still reach arbitrary URLs under runtime control.

4. **Compartments are secondary containment only**: If the verifier is wrong,
   a shared Compartment increases blast radius. Per-pattern Compartments reduce
   that blast radius but do not replace verification.

### 11.3 Deferred Capability Reintroduction

The following capabilities are intentionally excluded from the verified authored
module surface in v1. Reintroducing them requires separate scoped work.

1. **Time and randomness helpers**: Do not rely on
   `mathTaming` / `dateTaming` knobs as the long-term policy surface. Any
   future exposure of `Temporal`, `secureRandom()`, or `randomUUID()` to
   authored code requires explicit call-site restrictions.

2. **Direct `fetch()`**: A temporary compatibility shim currently exposes
   ambient `fetch()` and the adjacent web request globals it depends on inside
   SES compartments because existing importer/auth flows still rely on them.
   This currently applies to authored module assembly, `__cfHelpers.__cf_data(...)`
   snapshotting, and lazy callback rehydration. It should be deprecated in
   favor of runtime-managed graph constructors such as `fetchData()` plus an
   explicit egress policy.

### 11.4 Escape Hatch Analysis

Potential escape routes and their status:

| Vector | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `eval()` | Allowed inside SES compartments | Current lockdown uses `evalTaming: "safe-eval"` |
| `Function()` | Allowed inside SES compartments | Same `safe-eval` policy as `eval()` |
| `import()` | Rejected in v1 | Dynamic imports are deferred and verifier-rejected |
| authored AMD `require` | Inert | Authored factories receive a throwing stub; trusted tail wiring keeps its own loader state |
| Prototype access | Blocked | SES freezes intrinsics, and the runtime explicitly freezes forwarded host constructors and `.prototype` objects before installation |
| ambient web-fetch globals | Temporarily allowed | Compatibility shim in authored SES compartments; planned deprecation |
| `globalThis` | Controlled | Custom minimal Compartment globals; runtime freezes the compartment global object after installing bindings and does not expose internal console-hook globals |

---

## 12. Appendix

### A. SES Package Selection

**Recommended**: `ses` npm package (official from Agoric)

**Alternatives considered**:
- `@aspect-labs/ses` - Fork with minor fixes
- `lavamoat` - Higher-level, more opinionated
- QuickJS - Different approach (separate runtime)

### B. AMD Loader Compatibility

The existing AMD loader in `js-compiler` is compatible with SES Compartments. The loader is already:
- Self-contained (no global access)
- Pure (no side effects beyond module registration)
- Configurable (accepts runtime dependencies)

### C. Glossary

- **Compartment**: SES isolation boundary with its own global object
- **Harden**: Deep freeze an object graph
- **Lockdown**: Initialize SES, freeze all intrinsics
- **StaticModuleRecord**: SES's representation of an ES module
- **Import hooks**: Callbacks for resolving and loading modules
- **SESIsolate**: Runtime component that creates and manages Compartments with globals injection
- **SESRuntime**: Runtime harness that integrates SESIsolate into the pattern execution pipeline
