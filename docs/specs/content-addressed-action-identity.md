# Content-Addressed Action Identity

Retiring `implementationRef`, the `unsafe_originalPattern`/`unsafe_parentPattern`
backrefs, and pattern-scoped function registries in favor of `{ identity,
symbol }` references and object-keyed (WeakMap/WeakSet) trust.

## Status

Phases 0–2 shipped: #3997 (ordinal-free `implementationRef` + legacy-alias
shim), #4006 (A: `unsafe_parentPattern` deleted), #4008 (B: derived-copy side
tables, `unsafe_originalPattern` deleted), #4009 (C: `$implRef` dual-write +
CFC provenance), #4013 (D: pattern-scoped registries deleted, provenance
recording in `Engine.recordModuleProvenance`).

Phase 3 shipped in two PRs:

- **E1 (#4053, writer flip)**: writers emit `$implRef` only;
  `implementationRef` and the stringified body are no longer written where
  the reading runtime's engine proves the `$implRef` resolvable through its
  strong content-addressed implementation index
  (`ExecutableRegistry.registerVerifiedImplementation`, the resolution of
  open question 1 — see § Open questions). The legacy `implementationRef` is
  still written for exactly one category: registry-admitted artifacts the
  `$implRef` cannot cover — host-trusted values (`trustedHostFunctionIndex`,
  whose closures cannot survive a stringified round-trip) and dynamic
  in-action-created artifacts (no provenance symbol). `VerifiedProvenance`
  carries the evaluating load's `bundleId` so stored bundleId-only
  `writeAuthorizedBy` claims keep verifying without a `verifiedLoadId`.
- **E2 (legacy machinery deletion)**: every loadId surface is gone — frame
  threading, side tables, `seedVerifiedLoadIds`, per-load registry
  partitions and capture walks, the loadId-scoped `Harness` methods, the
  CFC `implementationRef`×`verifiedLoadId` arm (provenance is the only
  source of `kind: "verified"`), `FunctionCache`, and the prewarm walk. New
  `writeAuthorizedBy` claims are stamped with `moduleIdentity` only. What
  remains of the legacy machinery is exactly the gate-2 retained read path —
  `ensureImplementationRef` (+ ordinal shim) feeding ONE string-keyed global
  executable index behind `getExecutableFunction`, the bundleId-only
  verification arm for stored pre-#4009 claims, and the `unsafe-host:`
  minting that rides the same channel (the §5 synthetic-identity registrar is
  deferred to the cycle that retires this read path; decisions recorded in
  the implementation plan).

- **E3 (pattern JSON boundary, scoped to dual-write)**: `Pattern.toJSON()`
  emits the pattern's content-addressed `$patternRef: { identity, symbol }`
  ALONGSIDE the full graph; internal graph serialization
  (`serializePatternGraph`, the §7 escape hatch — used by builder-time node
  serialization and thus the `$opFallback` graphs) stays a bare graph, so the
  in-memory representation and the eviction fallback can never silently
  become refs. Readers dual-read: `resolveOpPattern` and llm-dialog's tool
  invocation (`resolveStoredPattern`) prefer the live canonical pattern by
  identity and fall back to the carried graph. Refs-ONLY emission was
  assessed and deferred (see §7 below and the implementation plan's E3
  gating record): there is no session-lifetime strong index for pattern
  artifacts — E1's implementation index is function-keyed, javascript
  modules only — so stored refs resolve solely through the FIFO-bounded
  artifact index (sync) or `loadPatternByIdentity` (async), neither of which
  covers the sync list builtins or cross-session llm-dialog reads.
  Canary: the stored-vintage canary pinned both graph vintages until E5
  retired them (now `test/stored-pattern-rehydration.test.ts`).
- **E4 (refs-only pattern JSON)**: the E3 blocker resolved —
  `addressableByIdentity` is session-lifetime (open question 1 extended to
  pattern artifacts; the FIFO eviction deleted), so sync resolution covers
  every module evaluated in the reading session. `Pattern.toJSON()` emits
  `{ $patternRef, argumentSchema, resultSchema }` with NO graph (patterns
  without an entry ref still serialize their graph); the op sentinel drops
  `$opFallback` (a sync miss is now a loud bug, not a recoverable state);
  llm-dialog adds the async storage-backed net (`resolveStoredPatternAsync`
  → `loadPatternByIdentity`; compiled artifacts persist in-space as an
  expected part of compilation). Stored graph vintages keep loading
  tolerantly; see §7's status block for the full record.

- **E5 (legacy read path retirement — MIGRATION COMPLETE)**: on the explicit
  data-wipe decision (no production data to preserve, so gate 2's stored-data
  evidence requirement dissolves), the entire legacy channel is gone:
  `ensureImplementationRef` + the ordinal shim, the ambient registrar, the
  string-keyed `verifiedFunctionIndex` + `getExecutableFunction`, the
  runner's legacy resolution arm, `Module.implementationRef` itself, the
  bundleId `writeAuthorizedBy` verification arm (+
  `ImplementationIdentity.bundleId`, `provenance.bundleId`), and the stored-
  vintage read tolerances. The two categories that still wrote legacy refs
  got their endgame designs: builder calls inside a running action THROW at
  creation time ("define the <kind> at module level", with a transformer-bug
  hint — CT-1644's hoisting makes this unreachable from authored source), and
  host-trusted values ride minted `host:<n>` PSEUDO-MODULES — registered as
  symbols in the session-lifetime implementation index, serialized as normal
  `$implRef`s, never granted CFC identity (§5, fail closed). A claim carrying
  a legacy bundleId stamp is recognized as stamped-but-unservable and fails
  closed rather than being re-bound to the next verified writer. Resolution
  gains the live-trusted arm: a module whose implementation carries
  trust-gated identity facts (provenance, or a host/artifact entry ref) runs
  that function directly — the in-memory path that used to flow through the
  legacy index.

Phase 4 is COMPLETE: there is one resolution model — content-addressed
`{ identity, symbol }`, by identity, everywhere.

The last parallel addressing scheme — the `pattern:<createRef>` patternId and
the pattern meta cell — is now also retired (patternId is the same content
address in a second, non-canonical encoding). See
[pattern-id-retirement](./pattern-id-retirement.md): `{ identity, symbol }` is
the only pattern pointer; cold recovery recompiles from the `pattern:<identity>`
source docs.

The design assumes the shipped state after the AMD-loader removal: the ESM
module-record loader is the only loader, every module has a content-addressed
identity (`cf:module/<hash>`), and every module-scope builder artifact
(pattern / lift / handler) is addressable as `{ identity, symbol }` — authored
exports by export name, hoisted/non-exported artifacts by their `__cfReg` key
(see `docs/specs/module-loading.md` and the op-by-identity migration that
introduced the `$patternRef` sentinel, `builtins/op-pattern-ref.ts`).

## Last Updated

## Motivation

Three legacy identity mechanisms predate content addressing and now duplicate
it badly:

1. **`implementationRef`** (`builder/module.ts:ensureImplementationRef`) — an
   opaque per-function ref minted from `{ kind, source: fn.src, preview:
   fn.toString(), ordinal: frame.generatedIdCounter++ }`. The **ordinal makes
   it build-order-dependent**: it is not a content address, and cross-reload
   matching works only because pattern instantiation is deterministic. It keys
   four string-indexed maps in the `ExecutableRegistry`, the per-runner
   `FunctionCache`, the CFC verified-identity resolution, and rides along in
   serialized module JSON (`moduleToJSON` spreads it via `...rest`).

2. **`unsafe_originalPattern` / `unsafe_parentPattern`** (symbols in
   `builder/types.ts`) — in-memory backrefs from serialized pattern copies to
   the live branded original. They exist so that (a) trust-chain walks
   (`isTrustedPattern` / `isTrustedBuilderArtifact`) can confer trust on
   copies, and (b) `getArtifactEntryRef` can resolve a copy to the registered
   `{ identity, symbol }`. Symbols never survive the storage round-trip, so
   every consumer already has a backref-less path; the symbols only serve the
   in-memory hop between build-time serialization and instantiation.
   `unsafe_parentPattern` is **write-only today** (set in
   `pattern-binding.ts:354`, read nowhere in `src/`) — it is already dead.

3. **`patternId`-scoped function registries**
   (`ExecutableRegistry.verifiedPatternFunctions` / `verifiedPatternLoadIds`,
   populated by `associatePattern`) — a session-scoped secondary index so a
   rehydrated pattern instance resolves *its* load's function objects. This
   exists to disambiguate equal `implementationRef`s across loads — a problem
   content addressing dissolves (below).

The scheduler is migrated to content addressing, with a fingerprint/id split:

- The durable implementation **fingerprint** keys on the per-**symbol** content
  address `impl:cf:module/<hash>:<symbol>` (`schedulerImplementationFingerprint`,
  `scheduler/action-run.ts`) — it identifies the implementation *code*, with no
  `implementationRef` dependence.
- The action **id** — the durable observation lookup key and the in-session
  `actionStats` key — must stay per-**instance**, so it appends a
  source-location-independent instance discriminator:
  `cf:module/<hash>:<symbol>:<instanceKey>`, where `instanceKey` is a
  reload-stable hash of the action's `{process, reads, writes}` links
  (`getSchedulerActionId`/`schedulerActionInstanceKey`, `scheduler/diagnostics.ts`
  + `runner.ts`). Without the instance key, N instances of one hoisted op (one
  `lift` called twice, a `map`, a repeated sub-pattern) would collide on a single
  id and observation.

Persisted-data compatibility: observations written under the previous
`fn.src`-derived id/fingerprint simply miss the new content-addressed lookup on
first resume, so the action re-runs once (the safe default) and re-persists under
the new key — no `SchedulerActionObservation.version` bump or re-key is required.

## The invariant this design stands on

**Every referenced pattern/handler/lift is addressable as `{ identity, symbol }`.**

- The builder-call-hoisting transformer
  (`ts-transformers/src/transformers/builder-call-hoisting.ts`) hoists every
  `lift(...)`/`handler(...)`/`pattern(...)` call to module scope
  (`__cfLift_N`/`__cfHandler_N`/`__cfPattern_N`) and emits a trailing
  `__cfReg({...})` registering every hoisted and non-exported module-scope
  builder artifact. Exports are addressable through the module namespace.
- `PatternManager.registerEvaluatedModules` indexes both channels into
  `addressableByIdentity` (identity → symbol → live value, FIFO-bounded) and
  `valueToEntryRef` (live value → `{identity, symbol}`), gated on
  `isTrustedBuilderArtifact`.
- Per-instance state does NOT live in function closures: handler/lift
  implementations are module-scope functions, and instance state is bound
  explicitly through node inputs (`$ctx`). Two `handler(...)` calls at the same
  source location are distinct hoisted symbols, not colliding closures.

**Soundness of content-addressed function resolution.** The per-module SES
verifier rejects top-level mutable bindings (`classifyModuleItems`: "Top-level
mutable bindings are not allowed in SES mode"). A verified module therefore has
no module-scope mutable state, so any two evaluations of the same module
identity produce **interchangeable** function objects. This is what makes it
sound to resolve a serialized node's implementation from *any* live evaluation
of that module identity — and what makes `patternId` scoping unnecessary.

For artifacts with no compiled module (host functions, in-test builders), a
synthetic-identity registration path covers the gap (§ Host and test
artifacts).

## Audit: where we make pattern copies, and whether we still need them

(The `unsafe_*` symbols only exist to ride on copies; if a copy site goes away
or stops needing identity-carry, the symbols die with it.)

| # | Copy site | What it does | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `createPattern` (`builder/pattern.ts` ~332, 368–373): build-time serialization of `result` + every node's `module`/`inputs`/`outputs` via `toJSONWithLegacyAliases` | Produces the `Pattern` object — the durable graph representation. Writes `unsafe_originalPattern` onto every nested pattern copy (`json-utils.ts:183`) | **Copy stays in memory; stops crossing the serialization boundary.** The in-memory graph remains the instantiation representation; `toJSON` at the storage boundary emits refs (§7). The *backref* is replaced by registering the copy in a side table at copy time (§ Trust). |
| C2 | `moduleToJSON` pattern-type implementation (`json-utils.ts:387`, the CT-1230 workaround): sub-pattern passed as a module implementation (e.g. to `.map()`) | Serializes the nested pattern graph instead of stringifying it | **Subsumed by op-by-identity.** The op already travels as `$patternRef` + `$opFallback`; with `$opFallback` retained the embedded copy is only the fallback payload. When the fallback is dropped (Phase 4), this copy site disappears. |
| C3 | `traverseValue` (`traverse-utils.ts:54`): copies during build traversal (`collectCellsAndNodes`, `node-utils` connect) | Preserves the backref so a traversal copy still resolves `getArtifactEntryRef` | **Copy stays; backref replaced** by side-table registration at the same line. |
| C4 | `unwrapOneLevelAndBindtoDoc` (`pattern-binding.ts:333–340`): instantiation-time rebinding copies | Propagates backref + the `verifiedLoadId` side-table entry to the bound copy | **Copy stays; backref replaced** by side-table registration; the `verifiedLoadId` propagation is deleted outright (CFC identity no longer flows through loadIds — § CFC). |
| C5 | `unsafe_noteParentOnPatterns` (`pattern-binding.ts:346–358`): writes `unsafe_parentPattern` | Nothing reads it | **Delete now.** Independent of the rest of this design. |

Net: the copies themselves are mostly load-bearing (the serialized graph is the
product); what dies is the *symbol-on-object identity-carry*. The replacement
is one explicit call at each copy site:

```ts
// Shown as interface or class members.
// pattern-manager (or a small trust module):
noteDerivedCopy(copy: object, original: object): void
//  - if isTrustedBuilderArtifact(original): brand `copy` as derived-trusted
//    (WeakSet add — same side-table family as brandTrustedPattern)
//  - if valueToEntryRef.has(original): valueToEntryRef.set(copy, ref)
```

This converts the *lazy backwalk* (follow symbols at lookup time) into an
*eager forward registration* (record at copy time). Lookup sites
(`isTrustedPattern`, `isTrustedBuilderArtifact`, `getArtifactEntryRef`,
`findOriginalPattern`) collapse to single WeakSet/WeakMap probes — no chain
walks, no cycle guards, no symbol declarations on `Pattern`.

Security note: the forged-value defense is unchanged in kind but simpler in
mechanism. Today a forger cannot reference the module-private symbol; tomorrow
there is nothing on the object at all — trust lives exclusively in runner-owned
WeakSets keyed by object identity, which `__cf_data`-forged values can never
enter (they are never passed to `noteDerivedCopy` with a trusted original).
`cfreg-security.test.ts`'s string-keyed-symbol forgery tests become "no
property on the object grants trust" tests.

## Target design

### 1. Serialized form: `$implRef` sentinel

A JavaScript module (handler/lift) in a serialized graph carries a plain-data
sentinel instead of `implementationRef` (+ conditionally stringified
`implementation`):

```jsonc
{
  "type": "javascript",
  "wrapper": "handler",
  "argumentSchema": { /* ... */ },
  "resultSchema": { /* ... */ },
  "$implRef": { "identity": "<module-hash>", "symbol": "__cfHandler_1" },
  "preview": "function (event, ctx) { ... }",   // debug only
  "location": "cf:module/<hash>/file.tsx:42:15" // debug only
}
```

- `identity` — prefix-free module content hash (same namespace as
  `$patternRef`, the compile cache, and `fn.src`).
- `symbol` — export name or `__cfReg` key of the **factory** the builder
  returned. The implementation function is reached as `factory.implementation`.
- Exactly the `$patternRef` precedent; same trust gate on resolution
  (`indexArtifact` only indexes `isTrustedBuilderArtifact` values, so whatever
  resolves is builder-made by construction).
- During the transition the stringified `implementation` is retained as the
  fallback payload (mirror of `$opFallback`); see Phases for when it drops.

`ensureImplementationRef` is deleted; nothing is minted at builder time. The
sentinel is stamped where the op sentinel is stamped today: at node
instantiation/serialization time, via `getArtifactEntryRef(factory)` —
generalizing `substituteOpPatternRefs` from `map/filter/flatMap` ops to **every
javascript-module node**.

### 2. Resolution (runner)

`resolveJavaScriptFunction(module, pattern)` becomes:

1. Live module object (fresh build): `module.implementation` is the function —
   use it (status quo; no lookup at all).
2. Rehydrated module with `$implRef`:
   `patternManager.artifactFromIdentitySync(identity, symbol)?.implementation`.
   This hits whenever the owning pattern is running — its module was evaluated,
   which is what populated the index. (Same liveness argument as ops; the
   bounded cache's eviction risk is covered by the fallback during transition,
   and by pinning the running pattern's modules — see Open questions.)
3. Fallback (transition only): stringified source via `getInvocation` (SES
   `evaluateCallback`) — runs sandboxed but **unverified**, so CFC identity is
   `unsupported` (fail-closed), exactly as registry misses behave today.

`FunctionCache` re-keys from `module.implementationRef` to the module object
(it already takes the module; a WeakMap keyed by module object also drops the
string indirection) — or is deleted if step 2 is cheap enough (two Map hits).

### 3. CFC implementation identity

Today (`cfc/implementation-identity.ts`): `kind: "verified"` is proven by
`getVerifiedFunctionInLoad(verifiedLoadId, implementationRef) ===
implementation` plus `isVerifiedSourceInLoad`, and reported as `{ bundleId,
sourceFile?, bindingPath?, sourceLocation, codeHash? }`. The `bundleId` is the
load's concatenated-script hash — load-scoped, not content-addressed.

Target: registration during verified evaluation records provenance keyed by
the **function object**:

```ts
// populated by registerEvaluatedModules / the __cfReg sink walk:
verifiedProvenance: WeakMap<Function, {
  identity: string;          // module content hash
  symbol: string;            // factory's export/__cfReg key
  bindingIdentity?: { sourceFile: string; bindingPath: string[] };
                             // from __cfVerifiedBindingIdentity (CT-1665),
                             // read off the factory annotation directly
}>
```

`resolvePolicyFacingImplementationIdentity` becomes: look the *function object*
up in `verifiedProvenance`; if present, emit

```ts
// Shown for illustration only.
{ kind: "verified",
  moduleIdentity,            // replaces bundleId — content-addressed, reload-stable
  symbol,                    // replaces codeHash for module-scope artifacts
  sourceFile?, bindingPath?, // unchanged semantics (writeAuthorizedBy)
  sourceLocation }           // from fn.src (already canonical cf:module/<hash>/…)
```

else `unsupported` (fail-closed). The WeakMap *is* the anti-spoof check — an
attacker-supplied function was never registered during a verified evaluation,
so it has no entry; there is no string key to collide and no loadId to scope.
This strictly strengthens the policy identity: `bundleId` varied per load and
per surrounding file set; `moduleIdentity` is stable for byte-identical code.

Consequences:
- `verifiedLoadId` threading through frames / `JavaScriptNodeContext` /
  `json-utils` (`frame.verifiedLoadId` in `moduleToJSON`'s
  `admittedImplementation` probe) is deleted. `setVerifiedLoadId` /
  `getVerifiedLoadId` side tables and `seedVerifiedLoadIds` /
  `annotateVerifiedPatterns` walks are deleted (their job — marking which load
  verified a pattern — is subsumed by `valueToEntryRef` + `verifiedProvenance`).
- `isVerifiedSourceInLoad` / `verifiedLoadSources` / `verifiedLoadBundleIds`:
  the source check becomes "does `fn.src`'s `cf:module/<identity>` prefix match
  the provenance identity" — a string comparison against the WeakMap entry, no
  per-load source sets.
- CFC label/policy storage that embeds identities: anything persisted that
  contains a `bundleId` is already load-scoped (unstable), so policy matching
  re-derives per session — switching to `moduleIdentity` is
  backward-compatible for enforcement (fail-closed on mismatch) but check
  `cfc/canonical.ts` digests for any persisted comparisons (Phase audit item).

### 4. ExecutableRegistry: what remains

Deleted: `verifiedFunctions`, `verifiedFunctionIndex`,
`verifiedFunctionLoadIds`, `verifiedBindingMetadata`,
`verifiedPatternFunctions`, `verifiedPatternLoadIds`,
`trustedHostFunctionIndex` + `unsafe-host:` ref minting, `beginVerifiedLoad`'s
cross-load index repair, `captureVerifiedValue`'s whole-namespace
`recordVerifiedFunctions` walk, `associatePattern`,
`setVerifiedFunctionRegistrar` and the builder-time
`registerVerifiedFunctionImplementation` channel.

Remaining (likely small enough to fold into PatternManager or a `trust.ts`):
- `verifiedProvenance` WeakMap (above) and its registration walk over
  `exportsByIdentity` + the `__cfReg` sink (today's
  `captureVerifiedBindingCandidates`, generalized).
- Host trust WeakSet (below).

`runner.discoverAndCacheFunctions` (prewarm walk keyed by ref) is deleted —
prewarming by `{identity, symbol}` is a single index probe if still wanted.

### 5. Host and test artifacts (the "pseudo module")

Some trusted callables have no compiled module: host-provided functions
(`runtime.unsafeTrustHostValue`, used for wish/builtin host capabilities) and
builder artifacts constructed directly in tests.

Design: a synthetic-identity registrar, one mechanism for both:

```ts
// Shown for illustration only.
runtime.unsafe_registerHostArtifact(value: object, options: {
  symbol: string;            // caller-chosen name
  reason: string;            // non-empty, like UnsafeHostTrustOptions today
}): { identity: string; symbol: string }
// identity = `host:` + hash of (reason, symbol, monotonic nonce) — a distinct
// namespace from cf:module hashes; never collides with compiled identities.
```

- Indexes `value` in `addressableByIdentity`/`valueToEntryRef` like any
  artifact, so serialization and resolution are uniform (`$implRef` with a
  `host:` identity resolves in-session only — host artifacts were never
  resumable from storage, unchanged).
- Trust: adds the value (and its `.implementation`) to a `hostTrusted` WeakSet;
  execution allowed, but CFC identity stays `undefined`/`unsupported` exactly
  as `unsafe-host:` refs behave today (`resolvePolicyFacingImplementationIdentity`
  returns `undefined` for host artifacts — fail-closed for policy purposes).
- Tests use the same API (possibly sugared as a `test-support` helper
  `registerTestArtifact(value, name)`), replacing every test that today relies
  on builder-time `implementationRef` registration outside a compiled program.
  Tests that want **verified** (CFC-passing) artifacts compile a small
  in-memory program — already the dominant idiom post-AMD.

### 6. `patternId` scoping: deleted

`verifiedPatternFunctions` existed so a pattern instance resolves the function
objects of *its* load when the same `implementationRef` was registered by
several loads. Under content addressing any live instance of the same module
identity is interchangeable (no module-scope mutable state — § Invariant), so
the global `addressableByIdentity` index suffices and the pattern-scoped
second key is dropped. `PatternManager`'s piece/meta `patternId` (URIs, meta
cells, LRU) is unrelated and stays.

### 7. Pattern JSON becomes refs; the graph representation goes internal

Decision (resolves former open question 1): the serialization *boundary* emits
`{ identity, symbol }` refs — the full node-graph JSON becomes a runtime-
internal representation (and a debug output, e.g. `cf check --pattern-json`).

The timing objection that motivated the lazy backref does not apply at the
boundary: `createPattern` runs during module evaluation (refs not yet indexed),
but `toJSON` runs when a value is *written to a cell* — after
`registerEvaluatedModules` has indexed the module. So:

- `Pattern.toJSON()` → `{ $patternRef: { identity, symbol } }` (plus
  `argumentSchema`/`resultSchema` if consumers need them without resolving).
- `moduleToJSON` for a pattern-type implementation (C2) → the same ref, not an
  embedded graph.
- `moduleToJSON` for javascript modules → `$implRef` (§1).
- `Pattern.nodes` / `result` / `initial` stay as the in-memory instantiation
  representation only; nothing outside the runner consumes them as JSON.

Status: COMPLETE in two steps. E3 (2026-06-11) shipped dual-write —
`$patternRef` alongside the graph — because pattern artifacts then had no
session-lifetime index: a stored ref resolved only through the FIFO-bounded
`addressableByIdentity` (sync) or `loadPatternByIdentity` (async), and the
two production consumers of stored graphs (the list builtins' sync
`resolveOpPattern`; llm-dialog's cross-session tool invocation) could not
tolerate a miss. E4 (same day) removed that blocker and completed the flip:

- `addressableByIdentity` is session-lifetime (open question 1, E4
  extension): sync resolution covers every module evaluated in the reading
  session — every authored op by construction, since whatever instantiates
  the map mentioned the op and loaded it as part of its bundle.
- `Pattern.toJSON()` emits `{ $patternRef, argumentSchema, resultSchema }` —
  no graph. Schemas ride along for consumers that read them without
  resolving (llm-dialog tool schemas). A pattern with NO entry ref
  (manually constructed / dynamic / bare-Engine evaluation, e.g. the CLI's
  `--pattern-json` debug dump) still serializes its full graph.
- `$opFallback` dropped from the op sentinel: it was eviction insurance, and
  eviction no longer exists; a sync miss is a loud bug. Stored pre-E4
  sentinel vintages are still read tolerantly.
- llm-dialog follows the sync resolution with the async storage-backed
  `loadPatternByIdentity` (`resolveStoredPatternAsync`) — compiled artifacts
  persist in-space as part of the compilation step (the cold write-back is
  AWAITED inside `compilePattern`, so a persisted ref always has a durable
  closure behind it), and a tool invoked cold after a reload rehydrates
  source-free.
- The write-path audit (E3) found graphs persisted at exactly three
  cell-write sites and on no wire/IPC surface; stored graph vintages
  (pre-E3 bare graph, E3 ref+graph) keep loading and executing — pinned by
  `test/pre-e3-pattern-value-canary.test.ts` alongside the refs-only
  vintage's two resolution paths.
- The internal/boundary split is structural: `serializePatternGraph()`
  (json-utils) serializes the full graph under an internal-serialization
  context that suppresses `$patternRef`; `toJSONWithLegacyAliases` (the
  builder-time node serializer) routes pattern values through it, so
  `Pattern.nodes` stays a bare-graph in-memory representation.

## Persisted-data compatibility

What's in stored graphs today (verified writer): `{ type: "javascript",
wrapper, schemas, implementationRef, preview, location }` — `implementation`
omitted when the function was admitted (verified) at serialization time, else
stringified. Resolution of old data depends on the registry repopulating the
same (ordinal-dependent!) refs when the pattern re-evaluates.

Phased migration (op-migration playbook):

- **Phase 0 — drop the `ordinal` from `ensureImplementationRef` (landable
  now).** The ordinal (`frame.generatedIdCounter++`) was a defense against the
  same function being inline-declared twice; the builder-call-hoisting
  transformer moves every builder call to a module-scope declaration and the
  SES verifier enforces that shape, so under the ESM loader `(kind, src,
  preview)` is already unique — and `src` is the canonical
  `cf:module/<hash>/<path>:line:col`, making the ref content-derived. Removing
  the ordinal eliminates build-order sensitivity (the same class of bug as the
  CT-1623 reload churn). Compat caveat: refs are persisted inside serialized
  graphs (e.g. `$opFallback` payloads); old ordinal-bearing refs will no
  longer match re-minted ones, so resolution of such stored graphs falls to
  the stringified-implementation fallback (or fails where the implementation
  was omitted). Mitigated by a transition shim (landed with Phase 0): the
  counter keeps incrementing at the same call sites and the fn is ALSO
  registered under the legacy `createRef({kind, source, preview, ordinal})`
  alias, reproducing the pre-removal ordinal sequence exactly. The attached/
  serialized ref is the content-derived one. The shim (and its test,
  `implementation-ref.test.ts`) is removed together with `implementationRef`
  itself in Phase 3.
- **Phase 1 — dual-write, dual-read.** Writers emit `$implRef` (+ keep
  `implementationRef` and the conditional stringified `implementation`).
  Readers prefer `$implRef`; absent that, fall back to the legacy
  `implementationRef` lookup (registry retained, deprecated). New CFC
  provenance WeakMap runs in parallel; CFC resolution prefers it and falls back
  to the loadId path. `noteDerivedCopy` lands; copy sites call it *in addition
  to* writing the symbol.
- **Phase 2 — legacy reads behind re-registration only.** Because a stored
  node only resolves after its pattern's module re-evaluates (which re-runs the
  builder and re-mints refs deterministically), the legacy path's only real
  dependency is `ensureImplementationRef` + the global index. Keep exactly
  that pair; delete pattern scoping, loadId threading, and the binding-metadata
  map (provenance WeakMap covers them).
- **Phase 3 — flip.** Writers stop emitting `implementationRef`/stringified
  `implementation`; `unsafe_*` symbols deleted (reads first, then writes);
  trust-chain walks become WeakSet probes; CFC loadId machinery deleted.
  Legacy read shim retained for stored-data only.
- **Phase 4 — drop the shim + fallbacks.** Requires either (a) accepted data
  migration on write (graphs rewrite to `$implRef` whenever a piece is saved —
  they do on every pattern re-instantiation, so old refs age out quickly), or
  (b) a `COMPILE_CACHE_RUNTIME_VERSION`-style cutoff. Also the point to decide
  whether `$opFallback`/stringified-implementation fallbacks can drop in favor
  of storage-backed by-identity loads (`loadPatternByIdentity` covers patterns;
  an analogous module-closure load covers handler modules — both async, so the
  sync action path keeps the in-memory index as the primary).

Rollback safety: Phases 1–2 are additive; the legacy path stays exercised by a
canary test compiling+resolving with `$implRef` stripped.

## What gets deleted (end state)

- `builder/module.ts`: `ensureImplementationRef`,
  `registerVerifiedFunctionImplementation` channel and its
  `setVerifiedFunctionRegistrar` ambient in `function-hardening.ts`.
- `builder/types.ts`: `unsafe_originalPattern`, `unsafe_parentPattern`, their
  `Pattern` declarations and `index.ts` exports.
- `json-utils.ts`: backref write (line ~183), `admittedImplementation` probe,
  the "must carry implementationRef" throw; `moduleToJSON` emits `$implRef`.
- `traverse-utils.ts` / `pattern-binding.ts`: backref/`verifiedLoadId`
  propagation → `noteDerivedCopy`; `unsafe_noteParentOnPatterns` deleted.
- `pattern-metadata.ts`: chain walks in `isTrustedPattern` /
  `isTrustedBuilderArtifact` (brand probes remain), `setVerifiedLoadId` /
  `getVerifiedLoadId` side tables.
- `pattern-manager.ts`: `findOriginalPattern`, `seedVerifiedLoadIds`,
  `patternToVerifiedLoadId`, `associateVerifiedFunctions`.
- `harness/executable-registry.ts`: ~everything string-keyed (§4);
  `function-cache.ts` re-keyed or deleted.
- `cfc/implementation-identity.ts`: loadId/ref plumbing → provenance WeakMap;
  `Harness` interface loses `getVerifiedLoadId`, `getVerifiedFunctionInLoad`,
  `isVerifiedSourceInLoad`, `getVerifiedBundleId`, `getVerifiedBindingMetadata`,
  `registerVerifiedFunction`, `getExecutableFunction`, `associatePattern`.
- `runner.ts`: `resolveJavaScriptFunction` ref path, `discoverAndCacheFunctions`,
  `verifiedLoadId` threading through `JavaScriptNodeContext`/frames.

## Delivery

- **Separate PRs per target**, independently revertible, each green before the
  next: (1) Phase 0 ordinal removal; (2) `unsafe_parentPattern` deletion
  (write-only today — no design dependency); (3) `noteDerivedCopy` + trust/
  entry-ref decoupling, then `unsafe_originalPattern` deletion; (4) `$implRef`
  dual-write + CFC provenance WeakMap; (5) pattern-scoped registry deletion;
  (6) flips and shim removals per the phases. Action-identity `patternId`
  rides on (5); the broader piece/root-pattern `patternId` (~300 refs across
  shell/piece/runtime-client, wire + persisted surfaces) is a separately
  designed follow-on — it has its own compat constraints (stored ids, IPC) and
  must not be bundled here.
- A note on layering (why `noteDerivedCopy` and not "just look at the
  manager"): the copy sites live in builder-layer utilities with no
  PatternManager handle. Either `noteDerivedCopy` lives module-level next to
  the trust WeakSets (preferred — `valueToEntryRef` keys are globally
  meaningful content addresses, so promoting that map toward module level is
  safe), or the builder calls it through the ambient frame.
- **Red-team pass** (security gate for the CFC change, PR 4): a dedicated
  adversarial review of the verified-identity path — forged functions with
  matching source text, `__cf_data`-shaped factories, replayed `$implRef`s
  pointing at other modules' symbols, host-artifact escalation attempts — with
  each attack landed as a test (extend `cfreg-security.test.ts` /
  `esm-verifier-adversarial.test.ts`). Every fail-closed property must be
  demonstrated, not argued.

## Test plan

- Red-green per phase: serialization snapshot tests pin the `$implRef` form;
  a stored-graph fixture (captured pre-migration) pins legacy-read compat.
- CFC: `cfc-implementation-identity.test.ts` ports to provenance-based
  `{ kind: "verified", moduleIdentity, ... }`; spoof tests assert an
  unregistered function (same source, constructed outside verified eval) is
  `unsupported`.
- Trust: `cfreg-security.test.ts` forgery suite ports from "string-keyed
  symbol is inert" to "no own property grants trust"; derived-copy trust tests
  go through `noteDerivedCopy`.
- Resume: `resume-by-identity` / `by-identity-handler-exec` extended with a
  handler-bearing piece resumed source-free, resolving through `$implRef`.
- Host/test registrar: a piece using `unsafe_registerHostArtifact` callables
  executes but its writes carry no verified identity (CFC fail-closed assert).
- Multi-instance: two pieces from byte-identical programs share resolution
  (the patternId-scoping deletion's regression guard).

## Open questions

1. **Eviction pinning — DECIDED (E1).** `addressableByIdentity` is
   FIFO-bounded; the op path tolerates eviction via `$opFallback`. Dropping
   the `implementationRef` writer removed the unbounded legacy registry's
   eviction insurance for new data, so E1 ships the replacement: a strong,
   session-lifetime, per-engine content-addressed implementation index
   (`ExecutableRegistry.verifiedImplementationsByEntryRef`, populated by
   `Engine.recordModuleProvenance`, surfaced as
   `Harness.getVerifiedImplementation`, consulted by `resolveByImplRef` after
   the bounded artifact index misses). Chosen over refcount pinning (piece
   lifecycle is fuzzy; high complexity) and a WeakRef shadow (fails exactly in
   the post-eviction-GC scenario it must cover). Memory is bounded by the set
   of distinct verified implementations per session — strictly less than the
   legacy per-load registries retained.
   **E4 extends the same resolution to pattern artifacts:**
   `addressableByIdentity` itself is now session-lifetime (its FIFO eviction
   deleted) — the same retention order, since the strong function index
   already keeps every verified implementation alive, and module-scope
   functions referencing module-level patterns transitively retain those
   factories anyway. With sync resolution eviction-proof for every module
   evaluated in the session, `$opFallback` was dropped: the op sentinel is
   stamped from its live artifact in the same session that reads it, so a
   miss is a loud bug, not a recoverable state. The module-NAMESPACE cache
   (`modulesByIdentity`) stays bounded; its misses recover via the async
   storage-backed load.
2. **`cfc/canonical.ts` digests.** Confirm no *persisted* artifact compares
   `bundleId`s across sessions (believed session-only; verify before Phase 3).
3. **`location`/`preview` retention.** Keep both on serialized modules for
   debugging (they're inert), or derive `location` from `$implRef` + symbol?
   Default: keep.
