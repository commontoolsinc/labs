# CFC across spaces — copying, referencing, and declassifying labeled values

_How to express, in a pattern or a test, the family of "move a labeled value
from one space to another" operations: keep its integrity, declassify its
confidentiality, or take only a subset — and where the authoring surface still
has gaps. Grounded in the runner implementation (`packages/runner/src/cfc/`) and
pinned end-to-end by
[`packages/runner/test/cfc-cross-space-integrity.test.ts`](../../packages/runner/test/cfc-cross-space-integrity.test.ts).
Spec ground: `commontoolsinc/specs` `cfc/03-core-concepts.md` §3.7 (cross-space
links), `cfc/08-02` (pass-through via references), `cfc/08-03` (projection),
`cfc/08-04` (exact-copy verification), `cfc/08-12` (store-label monotonicity /
declassification routes). Written 2026-07-10._

## 1. The scenarios and what carries the label

A "space" is a DID. Moving a labeled value between spaces has three questions:
does its **integrity** survive, is its **confidentiality** changed
(declassified), and is it the **whole** value or a **subset**. The load-bearing
fact is:

> **A reference (link) carries a label across a space boundary. Materialized
> bytes do not.**

When a cell in space B holds a link to a value in space A, the runtime derives
the persisted label at the link path from the *source's own space*
(`derivePersistedLinkLabel`, `prepare.ts`): the source integrity is preserved
and a runtime-minted `LinkReference` endorsement is added recording **both**
spaces (spec §3.7.2, integrity = target ∪ link-endorsement); the source
confidentiality is carried across (§3.7.1, viewing needs both spaces). The
persisted entry is stamped `origin: "link"`. This is the only mechanism that
crosses spaces today, and it is exercised for the first time by two real DIDs in
the test file above.

By contrast, once a handler reads a value into plain bytes and writes those
bytes into another space, the runtime has no basis to attest they are the same
labeled thing — the copy is a fresh, unendorsed value. That is not a bug; it is
why you carry the *reference*, not the extracted value.

## 2. Verbatim copy that keeps integrity

Two forms, both real:

- **Same document** — `ifc: { exactCopyOf: ["<sibling-path>"] }`. The runtime
  content-address-verifies that the field equals the named sibling path and
  copies that path's label onto it, both axes, unfiltered (spec §8.4.2). A
  mismatch rejects the commit with `exactCopyOf failed`.
- **Across spaces** — `exactCopyOf` compares two paths *within one value tree*,
  but a path may **hold a cross-space link**. So a field whose `exactCopyOf`
  source is a link into another space is (a) verified as an exact copy and (b)
  carries the source label across the boundary, because the label it copies is
  that path's link-carried label. This is "verbatim copy retains integrity
  across spaces": the link is the carrier, `exactCopyOf` is the verified claim
  on top of it.

`exactCopyOf` under an array wildcard (`"*"`) is unsupported and fails closed.

## 3. Declassify while copying

Declassification is a **boundary-time** rewrite, not a stored mutation. It is
expressed with **exchange rules** (`ExchangeRule`, `cfc/policy.ts`) evaluated at
the sink/egress boundary under `cfcPolicyEvaluation: "enforce"`. A rule's `post`
either `addAlternatives` (widen a confidentiality clause — e.g. add
`User($recipient)` so a specific reader may observe) or `dropClause` (release the
clause entirely), gated by a `preCondition` over `confidentiality` / `integrity`
/ `boundary` / `policyState` evidence. The rewrite is never persisted (spec
§8.12.7 route 1).

Two properties matter for "copy retains integrity while declassifying":

1. **Exchange rules only touch confidentiality.** They never add, drop, or alter
   integrity. So a declassified copy keeps every integrity claim it had — you
   can widen who may read a value without weakening its provenance.
2. **Fail-closed.** Without the required evidence, no rule fires and the clause
   stands (nothing is released).

Durable-but-revocable release uses **grants** (`tx.writeCfcGrant(...)`, a trusted
builtin write; `cfc/grants.ts`) consumed by a `policyState`-guarded rule (spec
§8.12.7 route 2a). **Single-use** grants additionally require
`experimental.commitPreconditions` and only satisfy a guard in a *consuming*
context. Route 3 — a new value carrying a wider authored label — is just
ordinary authoring, no special machinery.

## 4. Subsets — the subtle part

Two different meanings, two different behaviors:

- **Reference a subset of fields** — link the **specific sub-paths**, not the
  parent object. A link to `src.key("foo").key("bar")` carries only that leaf's
  label. **Gotcha:** linking the **whole** object does *not* project it to a
  narrower destination schema — the full source labelMap crosses, undeclared
  sibling fields included. A narrower schema is a read-time *view*, not a
  projection; it does not sanitize the reference. (The undeclared fields stay
  confined by their own confidentiality labels, so it is safe, not a leak — but
  "only the right fields crossed" is false.) To copy a genuine subset by
  reference, link exactly the leaves you want.
- **Declassify only a subset** — two orthogonal scopings compose:
  - **Per-path labels.** A value's label is stored per path, so only the
    field(s) you read/release reach the boundary evaluator.
  - **Clause-locality (home clause).** Within one label, a `selection:
    "referenced"` policy fires only on the clause carrying its hash-bound
    `policyRef` atom, never a sibling clause (spec CT-1874 / invariant 11). So a
    declassification scoped to one clause cannot widen an independent sibling
    requirement.

## 5. Gaps in the authoring surface

- **`projection` (§8.3) is implemented** _(landed 2026-07-10, after this
  document was first written)_ — a write through a schema declaring
  `ifc.projection = { from, path }` is verified at commit (the target value
  must equal the source field at `from + path`, same document) and carries the
  source's label: confidentiality in full (§8.3.1), integrity **scoped** to the
  projected pointer via `scope.projection` (§8.3.2), so a projected field can
  never claim whole-object integrity. Malformed and array-wildcard claims fail
  closed. The `Projection` / `ProjectionOf` / `ProjectionPath` helpers in
  `packages/api/cfc.ts` are safe to reach for; full behavior is pinned by
  `packages/runner/test/cfc-projection.test.ts` (and scenario 3a′ in this
  document's test file). Checked recomposition (`recomposeProjections`) remains
  unimplemented and fails closed.
- **`passThrough` (§8.2) remains unimplemented and fails closed** — a write
  through a schema declaring it is rejected with
  `unsupported trust-sensitive claim <key>` (`prepare.ts`
  `unsupportedTrustSensitiveReason`; also `collection`, `opaque`,
  `recomposeProjections`, `combinedFrom`, `transformation`, `addedIntegrity`).
  Reference behaviors stay reachable via per-path labels and links (§2, §4).
- **Authoring surface / runtime mismatch — reconciled** _(2026-07-10)_. The
  helper types that lowered to still-unimplemented keys were **removed** —
  `SubsetOf` / `FilteredFrom` / `LengthPreservedFrom` / `PermutationOf`
  (→ `collection`) and `OpaqueInput` (→ `opaque`) — so the authoring surface
  now only advertises what the runtime enforces. Reintroduce them together
  with the runner enforcement for §8.5 / §8.13. For collection-shaped needs
  meanwhile, prefer `ExactCopy`, `Integrity`/`AddIntegrity`, `Confidential`,
  `RequiresIntegrity`, `WriteAuthorizedBy`, and plain `Cell<T>` links.
- **No cross-space verbatim byte-copy carry.** By design (§1): carry the
  reference. Flagged here so future work does not mistake it for a missing
  feature to bolt on to `exactCopyOf`.

## 6. Can a pattern author exchange rules? No — and why

A pattern can declare **classification labels** (`ifc` confidentiality /
integrity atoms, via the `Cfc<>` helper types) and can **reference** a policy by
putting a `Policy(...)` / `Context(...)` / `policyRef` atom in a label (which
selects which registered record applies — the `selection: "referenced"` path).

But the **exchange rules themselves are deployment/runtime configuration**
(`RuntimeOptions.cfcPolicyRecords`, consumed at `Runtime` construction), not
pattern-authored. No shipped pattern defines a rule; `cfc/trusted-surfaces/
share-policy.tsx` is a UI surface that captures share *intent*, not a rule. This
split is deliberate: patterns are untrusted, and letting a pattern author its
own declassification would let it release its own data. Classification is
pattern-level; the authority to exchange/declassify is runtime-level.

## 7. Enforcement dials this depends on

From [`cfc-enforcement-matrix.md`](./cfc-enforcement-matrix.md): the label
mechanics (§1–§2, §4) run under the default `cfcEnforcementMode:
"enforce-explicit"`. Declassification (§3) additionally needs `cfcPolicyRecords`
configured plus `cfcPolicyEvaluation: "enforce"` (or `"observe"` to diagnose
without releasing). No shipped host configures a policy set today, so exchange
declassification is exercised only in tests and would be turned on per
deployment.
