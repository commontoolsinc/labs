# 04 — Server-side execution & transactions

Queries and writes execute **inside toolshed**, which already hosts the space
and owns its SQLite engine. The runtime reaches them over the **existing
space-scoped websocket** — the same connection used for `transact`, `graph.query`,
and `session.watch.*`.

## Where execution happens

- Each space is a single `@db/sqlite` `Database` opened by the memory engine
  ([`packages/memory/v2/engine.ts`](../../../packages/memory/v2/engine.ts),
  `open()` → `engine.database`), cached one-per-space by the server
  ([`packages/memory/v2/server.ts`](../../../packages/memory/v2/server.ts),
  `openEngine(space)`).
- The space websocket is served at `/api/storage/memory?space=<did>`
  ([`packages/toolshed/routes/storage/memory/memory.routes.ts`](../../../packages/toolshed/routes/storage/memory/memory.routes.ts)),
  authorized via UCAN on session open.
- Cell-derived SQLite databases (Section [03](./03-database-sources.md)) are
  **one sibling file per database** in the same storage directory (Q6 → Option
  A). **Writes** are **ATTACHed** to `engine.database` so the folded `sqlite` op
  rides the same commit transaction as the cell ops. **Reads** — cell-derived
  *and* injected on-disk — run on a separate **read-only pooled connection** for
  the file, never attached to the engine connection (see
  [Read path: a pooled read-only connection](#read-path-a-pooled-read-only-connection)).

Because we ride the same connection, queries inherit the session's existing
authorization; no new auth surface is added in v1. (CFC will later refine *what*
within the space a query may touch — Section [06](./06-cfc.md).)

## Isolation, namespacing & the statement guard

A pattern's SQL runs on the same connection as the authoritative memory store,
so isolation is load-bearing. The design relies on three things, none of which
needs a full SQL parser:

- **File boundary = namespace.** SQLite's only namespace primitive is the
  attached-database alias, so one file per cell-derived db *is* the namespace.
  On the **read** path the file is opened on its own connection, so its schema is
  plain `main` and an unqualified `messages` resolves to it with no core store to
  shadow. On the **write** path we ATTACH only the handle's own db for that
  commit; an unqualified `messages` resolves to it (SQLite resolves
  `main → temp → attached-in-order`), with **no identifier rewriting**. Because
  reads no longer attach, **the only thing ever attached is the single cell-db
  being written** (≤1 per commit) — so two cell-dbs are never attached at once,
  and unqualified resolution can't be ambiguous between cell-dbs. Qualification
  drops to defense-in-depth rather than a correctness prerequisite.
- **Core-table rename flag.** To remove the risk that an unqualified pattern name
  shadows/leaks a core table (`commit`, `revision`, `head`, `snapshot`,
  `branch`, `scheduler_*`, `blob_store`), rename the engine's core tables to
  include the space DID (e.g. `commit__<did>`), behind a flag. Pre-production we
  may ship unflagged and tolerate shadowing temporarily.
- **Tokenizer-level statement guard.** `@db/sqlite` exposes **no authorizer**
  (`sqlite3_set_authorizer` is not bound — confirmed against the library), so we
  cannot get SQLite to enumerate accessed objects for us. Instead the guard
  rejects: any **schema-qualified** reference (`other.table`), `ATTACH`/`DETACH`/
  `PRAGMA`, and **multiple statements**; `sqliteQuery` additionally requires a
  single `SELECT`/read-only CTE. Because we never rewrite identifiers, this is a
  tokenizer-level check, not full resolution. (A future hardening option: bind
  `sqlite3_set_authorizer` ourselves via Deno FFI against the `unsafeHandle`
  pointer — defense-in-depth, not required for v1.)

**Attach limit (write path only).** `@db/sqlite` exposes no `sqlite3_limit`
binding, so `SQLITE_LIMIT_ATTACHED` stays at the compiled default (≈10). Only
**writes** attach, and a single commit touches **at most one** cell-db, so the
limit is effectively never approached. The cell-db is attached before `BEGIN`
and **detached before the post-commit await** (the B1 fix) so the
≤1-attached-at-a-time invariant holds even across concurrent commits to
different cell-dbs on the shared per-space connection. (Reads no longer attach,
so the old LRU attach/detach *read* cache is gone — see the read path below.)

## Read path: a pooled read-only connection

> As-built (follow-up to PR #3776). Supersedes the original "attach the cell-db
> for every read and write, then detach" model, resolves the read-side of
> [08-open-questions.md](./08-open-questions.md) Q8 (connection contention), and

**All reads — cell-derived and injected on-disk — run on a dedicated read-only
connection opened directly on the db file, never attached to the space engine.**
Only **writes** attach to the engine (required: the folded `sqlite` op must ride
the same commit transaction as the cell ops, and SQLite has no cross-connection
atomicity). The motivation: a single read primitive that does not have to treat
cell-derived and on-disk sources differently, with no per-read ATTACH +
schema-cookie churn on the engine connection and no reliance on a connection-
global `query_only` window for read-only enforcement.

The only per-source difference is **path resolution**, not execution:

- **cell-derived**: `#cellDbPath(engine, space, db.id)`.
- **on-disk (injected)**: the `DiskSourceRegistry` descriptor path for
  `(space, db.id)`.

Execution is identical: open/reuse a read-only connection for that path, apply
the statement guard, run the `SELECT`, return rows.

### The connection pool (`ReadConnectionPool`)

[`packages/memory/v2/sqlite/read-pool.ts`](../../../packages/memory/v2/sqlite/read-pool.ts):

- Keyed by **canonical file path**; opened **read-only** (`new Database(path, {
  readonly: true })`). This is **real per-connection read-only** — replacing the
  `query_only` window — and gives each file its own `main` namespace, so a read
  can never reach a core/cell table by name.
- **LRU** with a cap well under the OS file-descriptor budget; evict → `close()`.
- The statement guard still applies on every `query`, so a read can't use its
  connection to `ATTACH`/`PRAGMA` to another file.
- Closed with the server (`Server.close()` → `#readPool.close()`).

### Create-on-read semantics (cell-dbs)

A never-written cell-db has **no file** yet — its schema is created on the first
*write* (the attach path runs `ensureTables`). A read-only connection cannot
`CREATE TABLE`, so `#readCellDb` preserves the "fresh cell-db reads `[]`"
contract without writing:

1. **Missing file → `[]`** (NotFound only; any other `stat` failure surfaces, so
   a permissions/I/O error is never masked as an empty result).
2. **"no such table" for a DECLARED table → `[]`.** Once the file exists,
   `ensureTables` has created every table declared at that write; a "no such
   table" therefore means either a declared table not yet materialized (the
   schema evolved since the last write — behaves like a fresh, empty table) or
   an **undeclared** table (a typo / mistake). The fallback is scoped to the
   declared schema (`db.tables`): declared → `[]`, undeclared → **rethrow**, so
   genuine query/schema errors are not silently swallowed.

On-disk sources never hit this — their external schema already exists and we
never migrate them.

### Read-after-write visibility (cell-dbs)

A cell-db now has a pooled read connection *and* the write-via-attach. **WAL is
not required** for our access pattern: reads observe only *committed* state
(read-after-write *within* a transaction is unsupported — see
[Ordering within a commit](#ordering-within-a-commit)), writes serialize on the
engine connection, and each query is a *fresh* read transaction (`.all()`), so a
reused pooled connection observes writes committed after it opened (pinned by a
test in `v2-sqlite-protocol-test.ts`). WAL remains a future hardening for
concurrent read-*during*-write, not a correctness prerequisite.

An additive schema migration on the write connection bumps the schema cookie;
the pooled reader reloads schema on its next access automatically.

### `ensureTables` only on the first write

Independently of the pool, `ensureTables` (a `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` per
declared table) runs only on the **first write** per `(space, id, schema-JSON)`,
gated by a bounded LRU `#ensuredSchemas` set keyed by the declared `db.tables`.
A changed declaration → new key → re-ensure (additive migration). This removes
the per-write N-DDL cost; reads run no DDL at all. (A restart re-ensures once,
idempotently.)

## Protocol extension

The v2 protocol is a discriminated union of message `type`s
([`packages/memory/v2.ts`](../../../packages/memory/v2.ts), `ClientMessage` /
server messages; parsed in `parseClientMessage`, routed in
`Connection.receiveOrdered`, correlated by `requestId` in
[`packages/memory/v2/client.ts`](../../../packages/memory/v2/client.ts)). It is
extensible by adding variants. We add **one new read verb** and **fold writes
into the existing `transact` commit**.

### Reads: `sqlite.query` (new verb)

```ts
// Shown at module scope.
interface SqliteQueryRequest {
  type: "sqlite.query";
  requestId: string;
  space: string;
  sessionId: SessionId;
  db: SqliteDbRef;            // resolved source descriptor (Section 03)
  sql: string;               // single read-only statement
  params?: unknown[] | Record<string, unknown>;
}

// Response rides the existing ResponseMessage envelope:
//   { type: "response", requestId, ok?: { rows: unknown[] }, error?: V2Error }
```

Server handling (mirrors `Server.transact` / `Server.queryGraph`):

1. Route the new `type` in `Connection.receiveOrdered`, guarded by
   `requireSession`.
2. **Apply the statement guard** (above): single `SELECT`/read-only CTE; reject
   DML/DDL, schema-qualified references, `PRAGMA`/`ATTACH`/`DETACH`, and multiple
   statements, with a `read-only-violation` / `guard-violation` error. The guard
   runs **before** any file/short-circuit so a rejected statement is refused even
   against a never-written cell-db.
3. Resolve the db ref to its on-disk file **path**: an injected on-disk source's
   registered path (`DiskSourceRegistry`), else the cell-db path
   (`#cellDbPath(engine, space, db.id)`).
4. Run the query on the **read pool** (`ReadConnectionPool.query(path, sql,
   params)`) — a path-keyed, read-only connection (see below). Cell-db
   create-on-read semantics are preserved by the pool caller (`#readCellDb`):
   a missing file → `[]`, a "no such table" for a **declared** table → `[]`,
   anything else → surface the error.
5. Reply with `{ type: "response", requestId, ok: { rows } }`.

`_cf_link` decoding (Section [02](./02-cf-link-encoding.md)) happens **on the
client** after the rows return, because reconstructing a `Cell` needs the
runtime. The server returns raw strings.

### Writes: `db.exec`, folded into `transact`

Writes are **not** a separate RPC and **not** a reactive built-in. The author
calls `db.exec(sql, params?)` (a method on the `SqliteDb` cell, Section
[01](./01-api.md#dbexecsql-params--imperative-write)) inside a handler. It
returns `void` and records a `sqlite` op onto the **caller's transaction** — the
same transaction that carries the surrounding cell writes — so they apply in the
**same SQLite transaction**.

The client-side seam is:

```
db.exec(...)                                  // packages/runner/src/cell.ts
  → tx.recordSqliteWrite(space, { op: "sqlite", db, sql, params })
                                              // storage transaction (interface.ts +
                                              //   v2-transaction.ts / extended-storage-transaction.ts)
  → getNativeCommit                           // folds the op into the pending commit
  → ClientCommit { operations: [...cellOps, sqliteOp] }
                                              // packages/memory/v2.ts
  → engine applies all operations atomically  // applyCommitTransaction
```

The client commit (`ClientCommit` in
[`packages/memory/v2.ts`](../../../packages/memory/v2.ts)) carries an
`operations: Operation[]` list applied inside
`engine.database.transaction(applyCommitTransaction).immediate(...)`
([`packages/memory/v2/engine.ts`](../../../packages/memory/v2/engine.ts)
`applyCommit` → `applyCommitTransaction`, which iterates operations through
`writeOperation`). The `sqlite` operation kind:

```ts
// Shown at module scope.
interface SqliteOperation {
  op: "sqlite";
  db: SqliteDbRef;       // which attached database
  sql: string;           // write statement(s)
  params?: unknown[] | Record<string, unknown>; // _cf_link params pre-encoded by client
}
```

`writeOperation` handles `case "sqlite"` that, for a cell-derived db:

1. Ensures the db is ATTACHed to `engine.database` (the connection already
   inside the open transaction).
2. Executes the statement via the same connection — so it is part of the very
   `.immediate()` transaction that writes cell revisions. Either everything
   commits or everything rolls back.

**Abort-only on failure.** `db.exec` returns `void` and exposes no result cell:
there is no `pending`/`success`/`error` state. If the SQL statement fails, the
`.immediate()` transaction throws and the **whole commit aborts** — the cell
writes that rode the same transaction roll back too. The author surfaces failure
through the commit failing, not through a per-write result. (`db.exec` also
**throws on the client** before the commit if a param is `undefined` — a value
that isn't ready yet — or if a cell is bound to a non-`_cf_link` column; Sections
[01](./01-api.md) and [02](./02-cf-link-encoding.md).)

`_cf_link` parameters are **encoded on the client** (Section
[02](./02-cf-link-encoding.md)) before the operation is placed in the commit, so
the server stores ready-made link strings and never needs runtime cell access.

The same commit also carries the `rev`-bumped handle-cell value that drives
`reactOn: db` re-query and write serialization (Section
[05](./05-reactivity.md)).

This keeps the atomicity property the runtime already relies on: a commit is one
SQLite transaction with a single global `seq`. Cell writes and SQLite writes
land together.

## Ordering within a commit

Per the goals, **writes are executed after** the rest of the commit's cell
operations, and **read-after-write within the same transaction fails**:

- `sqlite` operations are ordered last among the commit's operations (the
  `sqlite` op is appended after the cell ops).
- A `sqlite.query` issued from inside the same transaction that has pending
  (uncommitted) `sqlite` writes is rejected with a `read-after-write-unsupported`
  error. v1 does not simulate the pending write: a query against a db with
  pending writes in the same transaction throws rather than reading stale state.

## Atomicity across cells and SQLite (and WAL caveat)

Goal: transactions are **atomic across cells and the attached SQLite database**.

- **Normal operation.** Because the attached db shares the engine connection,
  `BEGIN … COMMIT` spans the main space db and the attached db. SQLite commits
  attached databases atomically when they share a connection and journal
  coordination — so in the no-crash path, cells and rows commit together.
- **WAL caveat.** The engine runs `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL`
  ([`packages/memory/v2/engine.ts`](../../../packages/memory/v2/engine.ts)
  `PRAGMAS`). With WAL, cross-file atomic commit is **not guaranteed across a
  crash** mid-commit: one file's WAL frame may be durable while the other's is
  not. In normal (no-crash) operation the commit is atomic.
- **Post-crash safety (V1: detect + quarantine).** Each attached db carries a
  small `_cf_commit_watermark(seq)` row, written **inside** the commit txn and
  advanced on commit; the commit also **persists its `sqlite` ops** in the commit
  record. On open, the engine compares the space's committed `seq` (the `commit`
  table, [`packages/memory/v2/engine.ts`](../../../packages/memory/v2/engine.ts)
  `insertCommit`) against each attached db's watermark. If they **disagree** —
  the only thing the WAL crash window can cause — the engine **quarantines** that
  pattern db: it fails the db's queries with a clear error and logs loudly,
  rather than serving divergent data. It does **not** silently proceed.
- **Auto-repair is deferred** (fast-follow): replay the persisted ops for a db
  that is *behind*, truncate orphaned in-doubt writes for one that is *ahead*,
  then lift the quarantine. Persisting ops + the watermark in V1 means this needs
  no later schema migration.

## Concurrency

- `transact`-folded **writes** serialize on the single-threaded/synchronous
  engine connection like all other engine work. **Reads no longer run on the
  engine connection** — they run on the read pool's per-path read-only
  connections (see [Read path](#read-path-a-pooled-read-only-connection)), so a
  long query no longer blocks the space's writes. (A statement timeout remains a
  worthwhile guard against a single runaway read.)
- Multi-tab / multi-client coordination for the *write* side is inherited from
  the existing commit model (seq-based validation, optimistic local commit,
  server confirmation), so no new mutex is needed for writes. Concretely, because
  `db.exec` does a read-modify-write of the handle cell's `rev` in the same
  commit, two concurrent `db.exec` commits conflict on that cell's
  optimistic-concurrency revision and serialize — one retries (Section
  [05](./05-reactivity.md)). (Contrast `fetchData`, which needs `tryClaimMutex`
  because it has no transactional backstop.)
