# 05 — Reactivity

SQLite is not itself reactive: nothing in the runtime's read-tracking observes a
`SELECT`. v1 makes queries reactive with an explicit, coarse mechanism — **the
handle cell itself stands in for "this database changed"** — which gets us a
long way without a query-dependency analyzer.

## The model

- `db.query` (or the equivalent `sqliteQuery`) takes a `reactOn` input. The
  built-in reads it **wholesale under an `any` schema**, so the scheduler records
  a dependency on that value and everything it transitively links to. When
  `reactOn`'s **committed** value changes, the scheduler re-runs the query
  action, which re-issues `sqlite.query` and writes fresh rows into its result
  cell.
- Pass **the whole `db` handle** as `reactOn`. The query subscribes to the
  handle cell. **`db.exec` bumps a monotonic `rev` counter on that same handle
  cell as part of its own write commit** (see "The rev bump, in-commit"), so the
  handle value changes when (and only when) a write commits — `reactOn: db` means
  "any committed write to this database re-runs the query."
- `reactOn` also accepts **any other value or cell**. Authors who want tighter
  invalidation pass a narrower cell (e.g. a per-table or per-topic cell they bump
  themselves from the same handler that writes), trading precision for manual
  bookkeeping. v1 does not parse SQL to compute fine-grained read sets.

This is deliberately the same shape the runtime uses elsewhere: reactivity is
driven by observing cells, and the handle cell's changing `rev` stands in for
"the query's underlying data may have changed."

## The rev bump, in-commit

The query must re-run against **fully-committed** data, never optimistic
in-flight writes. The implementation gets this for free by folding the rev bump
into the write's own commit:

- `db.exec` records the `sqlite` op onto the caller's transaction **and** does a
  read-modify-write of `rev` on the handle cell **in the same commit** (one
  commit = cell ops + the `sqlite` op + the `rev`-incremented handle value). See
  [`packages/runner/src/cell.ts`](../../../packages/runner/src/cell.ts) and
  Section [04](./04-server-execution-and-transactions.md).
- The scheduler lets an action see its *own* uncommitted writes within a
  transaction and propagates to other readers only after commit (per the
  scheduler's transaction model and own-commit-source skip in
  [`packages/runner/src/scheduler/`](../../../packages/runner/src/scheduler/)).
  Because the `rev` change rides the write commit, a query depending on the
  handle is notified only once that commit lands — exactly when the SQLite write
  is durable. There is no window where the query re-runs before the write is
  visible to `sqlite.query`.

There is **no readable `version` field** for code to depend on out of band; the
handle cell's `rev` is internal to this mechanism, and patterns forward the
handle rather than reading it.

## Write serialization (the multi-tab write mutex)

Because the `rev` bump is a **read-modify-write on the handle cell**, two
concurrent `db.exec` commits both read the same `rev` and try to write `rev + 1`.
They therefore **conflict on the handle cell's optimistic-concurrency revision**
and serialize: one commit wins, the other is rejected on the seq/revision check
and retries against the new value. This is the "multi-tab write mutex" — folding
`exec` into the cell commit provides it **for free**, with no separate mutex
primitive (contrast `fetchJson`, which needs `tryClaimMutex` because it has no
transactional backstop).

## What does *not* trigger re-run

- Changes to the **contents of cells referenced by `_cf_link` columns** do not,
  by themselves, re-run the query — the query only re-reads rows. A decoded
  `Cell` in a result row (from a typed `db.query<Row>`, Section
  [02](./02-cf-link-encoding.md)) is, however, a normal reactive cell: a
  `derive` that reads it will update when *it* changes, independent of the query.
  This keeps query re-execution coarse while still letting per-cell reactivity
  flow through normally.
- Writes to *other* databases bump *their* handle cells' `rev`, not this one.

## Injected service-space handles (cross-space wrinkle)

For a `cf`-injected on-disk database (Section [03.3](./03-database-sources.md)),
the handle cell lives in an operator/service space while the SQLite write rides
the *pattern's* space commit — so the same-commit rev bump cannot apply directly
(the handle cell is in a different space than the commit). That source is stubbed
in v1; when it lands it will need an explicit cross-space dirty signal. Injected
datasets are usually read-mostly (`reactOn` omitted), so this does not block v1.
