# UI Components Reference

This file is the **agent-facing index plus usage narrative** for the Common
Fabric UI library. Division of labor:

- **This file** — complete component index (tag, purpose, bindable props) and
  the usage narrative that is not derivable from source.
- [`packages/patterns/catalog/catalog.tsx`](../../../packages/patterns/catalog/catalog.tsx)
  and the story files under
  [`packages/patterns/catalog/stories/`](../../../packages/patterns/catalog/stories/)
  — authoritative, type-checked live usage.
- Component source under
  [`packages/ui/src/v2/components/`](../../../packages/ui/src/v2/components/)
  — authoritative props, events, and JSDoc.
- [`packages/ui/LLM-COMPONENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`](../../../packages/ui/LLM-COMPONENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md)
  — HTML attribute tables per component.

## Bidirectional Binding

Use the `$` prefix for explicit two-way sync. That is the normal authoring
form for Common Fabric controls. No handler is needed for simple updates.

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
<cf-checkbox $checked={item.done} />    // Auto-syncs checkbox state
<cf-input $value={title} />             // Auto-syncs text input
<cf-select $value={category} items={[...]} />
```

**Native HTML inputs are one-way only.** Always use the Common Fabric form
components for inputs.

Use camelCase for component properties — kebab-case JSX attributes don't map
correctly:

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
// ❌ Kebab-case won't work
<cf-autocomplete allow-custom={true} />  // Sets element["allow-custom"], not allowCustom

// ✅ CamelCase works
<cf-autocomplete allowCustom={true} />  // Sets element.allowCustom correctly
```

When a control is already bound to a cell via `$value`, treat that binding as
the primary value path. Avoid `oncf-change` handlers that simply write the same
value back into the same cell; use them only for dependent state or side
effects.

For when to use handlers vs binding — and the standard `equals()` idiom for
removing array items by identity — see
[two-way-binding](../patterns/two-way-binding.md).

### Testing note: Playwright `fill()`

Playwright's `fill()` does not work on `cf-input` hosts (they are custom
elements, not native inputs). Use `type @ref "text"` in agent-browser, or
`locator.pressSequentially()` in Playwright tests:

```bash
agent-browser snapshot -i              # → textbox "Title" [ref=e4]
agent-browser type @e4 "Quarterly plan"
```

### Accessibility shape for custom elements

Choose the semantic anchor from the component's interaction model:

- Put role, state, focus, and keyboard handling on the custom-element host when
  the component represents one logical control.
- Use separately named native controls inside the shadow root when a composite
  component exposes multiple independent actions. A single host role cannot
  represent actions such as both opening and removing a chip.
- Use list and list-item semantics for informational collections; do not turn
  information-only items into buttons or tab stops for automation.

The native-shadow approach is simpler and preserves browser behavior, but
shadow-blind DOM walkers cannot see those controls. The supported role/name
locators in agent-browser and Playwright consume the flattened accessibility
tree and do see them. See
[Testing Shadow DOM Components](../../development/UI_TESTING.md) for the full
decision table and fallback locator strategy.

## Component Index

One row per component directory in `packages/ui/src/v2/components/`. "Bindable
props" lists cell-bound (`$`-prefixed) properties verified in source; an empty
cell means none confirmed — check the component source before assuming.

## cf-form

`cf-form` provides a "write gate" for transactional form submission:

- Fields buffer writes locally instead of immediately writing to cells
- On submit, all buffered values are validated and flushed atomically, then
  `cf-submit` is emitted
- On reset (`cf-button type="reset"` or `form.reset()`), buffered changes are
  discarded and fields restore their initial cell values
- Works for both "create" (fresh staging cell) and "edit" (existing cell) modes

All form-compatible fields (`cf-input`, `cf-select`, `cf-checkbox`,
`cf-textarea`) share the same behavior: **outside** `cf-form` they write to
the bound cell immediately; **inside** `cf-form` they buffer until submit.

```tsx
// Shown as JSX element children.
<cf-form oncf-submit={handleSubmit}>
  <cf-input name="email" $value={data.key("email")} required />
  <cf-button type="submit">Save</cf-button>
</cf-form>
```

### Create mode

Bind fields to a staging cell, then copy to the collection on submit:

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
const formData = new Writable({ name: "", email: "" });

<cf-form
  oncf-submit={handler((_, { formData, collection }) => {
    // cf-form flushes buffers to cells before emitting cf-submit,
    // so we can read the complete, typed object directly.
    // IMPORTANT: Copy the object to avoid sharing references!
    collection.push({ ...formData.get() });
  }, { formData, collection })}
>
  <cf-input name="name" $value={formData.key("name")} required />
  <cf-input name="email" $value={formData.key("email")} type="email" />
  <cf-button type="submit">Create</cf-button>
</cf-form>;
```

**The copy trap:** always copy with `{ ...formData.get() }` when adding to a
collection. The staging cell is reused between submissions, so pushing the same
object reference would make all items share the same data.

### Edit mode

Bind fields to a pointer (`Writable<Person>`) instead of using indices; on
submit, values are flushed to the bound cell:

```tsx
// Shown at module scope.
export const EditPerson = pattern<{ person: Writable<Person> }, { [UI]: VNode }>(
  ({ person }) => ({
    [UI]: (
      <cf-form oncf-submit={closeModal}>
        <cf-input name="name" $value={person.key("name")} required />
        <cf-input name="email" $value={person.key("email")} type="email" />
        <cf-button type="submit">Save</cf-button>
        <cf-button type="reset">Cancel</cf-button>
      </cf-form>
    ),
  }),
);
```

When choosing which item to edit from a list, store the pointer and find it
with `equals()` (see [two-way-binding](../patterns/two-way-binding.md)), not
array indices, which drift when lists change.

### Events and best practices

- `cf-submit` — emitted after validation passes and buffers are flushed.
  Handlers should read from the bound cell directly (type-safe), not from
  event detail.
- `cf-form-invalid` — emitted when submit is attempted but validation fails;
  detail carries `{ errors: Array<{ element, message? }> }`.
- Fields use HTML5 constraint validation by default.
- When using `cf-modal` around a form, bind `$open` to a `Writable<boolean>`
  (not a `computed`) so the modal can update state.

Contributor-facing internals (FormFieldController, file organization, design
decisions) live in
[`packages/ui/docs/forms-internals.md`](../../../packages/ui/docs/forms-internals.md).

## cf-field

`cf-field` is a layout/typography wrapper for labeled form fields. It replaces
the hand-rolled label-above-control stack repeated throughout patterns:

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
// Before
<cf-vstack gap="1">
  <label style={{ fontSize: "12px", color: "#6b7280" }}>Email</label>
  <cf-input type="email" $value={address} />
</cf-vstack>

// After
<cf-field label="Email">
  <cf-input type="email" $value={address} />
</cf-field>
```

Attributes:

- `label` — small muted label rendered above the control
- `required` — appends a danger-colored asterisk to the label
- `error` — error text below the control in the danger color (replaces `help`
  while set)
- `help` — muted helper text below the control

The default slot takes any control (`cf-input`, `cf-select`, `cf-textarea`,
…). All colors and sizes come from theme tokens, so fields adapt to the
ambient `cf-theme`.

```tsx
// Shown as JSX element children.
<cf-field label="Username" required error={usernameError}>
  <cf-input $value={username} placeholder="Pick a username" />
</cf-field>

<cf-field label="Bio" help="Shown on your public profile.">
  <cf-textarea $value={bio} />
</cf-field>
```

Notes:

- `cf-field` is presentation only — it renders whatever `error` string it is
  given. Validation logic and submit gating belong to
  [`cf-form`](#cf-form) or the pattern.
- Shadow DOM prevents a native `for`/`id` association with the slotted
  control, so clicking the label focuses (and for custom elements, clicks)
  the first slotted element instead — same approach as `cf-label`. For full
  assistive-technology support, also set `aria-label` on the control itself.

---

## cf-render

Renders pattern instances for composition.

```tsx
// Shown at module scope.
import SubPattern from "./sub-pattern.tsx";

const subView = SubPattern({ items });

// Three equivalent ways:
<cf-render $cell={subView} />   // Most explicit
{subView}                        // Direct interpolation
<SubPattern items={items} />     // JSX syntax
```

**Use `$cell`, not `piece` or `pattern` attribute.**

Multiple patterns sharing data:

```tsx
// Shown inside a pattern body.
const listView = ListView({ items });
const gridView = GridView({ items });

<div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "1rem" }}>
  <cf-render $cell={listView} />
  <cf-render $cell={gridView} />
</div>
// Both views stay in sync automatically
```

See [composition](../patterns/composition.md) for more on pattern composition.

### UI variants (CT-1321)

A piece can expose a **size spectrum** of renderings as optional sibling output
keys, addressed by symbols vended from `commonfabric`:

| Variant | Output key | Symbol | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `full` | `"$UI"` | `UI` | Standalone rendering — the default, and the universal floor. |
| `chip` | `"$CHIP_UI"` | `CHIP_UI` | Inline rendering for text and lists. |
| `tile` | `"$TILE_UI"` | `TILE_UI` | Gallery/grid card. |

Pick a variant with the `variant` attribute (default `"full"`):

```tsx
// Shown as JSX element children.
<cf-render $cell={piece} variant="full" />   // default — standalone
<cf-render $cell={piece} variant="chip" />   // inline
<cf-render $cell={piece} variant="tile" />   // gallery/grid tile
```

**Failover — every piece renders at every variant.** When a piece doesn't
export the requested variant key, `cf-render` substitutes a per-variant platform
default:

- `chip` → a `cf-cell-link` bound to the piece (renders it by its `[NAME]`).
- `tile` → the full `[UI]` rendered small at ~0.5 scale, clipped to a static
  preview and clickable to navigate to the piece (like `cf-cell-link`).

Because `full`/`[UI]` is the universal floor, a piece that exports only `[UI]`
still renders correctly at `chip` and `tile`.

A pattern exports the spectrum by returning the sibling keys:

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
import { CHIP_UI, NAME, pattern, TILE_UI, UI } from "commonfabric";

export default pattern(({ title }) => ({
  [NAME]: title,
  [UI]: <FullView title={title} />,      // standalone (always provide this)
  [CHIP_UI]: <InlineChip title={title} />, // optional inline
  [TILE_UI]: <GridTile title={title} />,   // optional gallery tile
}));
```

See `packages/patterns/examples/ui-variants-demo.tsx` for a full example.

> Note: `sidebarUI`/`fabUI`/`settingsUI` are shell composition **slots**, a
> separate concept — not size variants. A vended `uiVariant()` helper for
> render paths outside `cf-render` is a planned follow-up and does not exist yet.

---

## cf-screen

Full-height app layout with pinned header, auto-scrolling main area, and pinned
footer. Use instead of `<div style={{ height: "100%" }}>` which doesn't work
(parent has no explicit height).

Content in the default slot scrolls automatically when it overflows. Use
`cf-vscroll` inside `cf-screen` only when you need snap-to-bottom (chat),
fade-edges, or a styled/hidden scrollbar.

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
// Simple case — main area scrolls automatically
<cf-screen>
  <cf-heading slot="header" level={2}>Title</cf-heading>
  <cf-vstack gap="4" padding="4">
    {items}
  </cf-vstack>
</cf-screen>

// Chat case — snap-to-bottom + fade-edges
<cf-screen>
  <cf-heading slot="header" level={2}>Chat</cf-heading>
  <cf-vscroll flex snapToBottom fadeEdges>
    {messages}
  </cf-vscroll>
  <cf-message-input slot="footer" />
</cf-screen>
```

---

## cf-empty-state

Centered, muted placeholder for empty lists and regions. Use instead of ad-hoc
`<div style="text-align: center; color: ...; padding: 2rem;">` blocks.

The message comes from the `message` attribute (simple case) or the default
slot. Optional `icon` and `action` slots render above and below the message.

```tsx
// Shown inside a pattern body.
// Simple case — message attribute
{items.get().length === 0
  ? <cf-empty-state message="No items yet. Add one below!" />
  : null}

// With icon and a call to action
<cf-empty-state>
  <span slot="icon">📋</span>
  Your shopping list is empty.
  <cf-button slot="action" size="sm" onClick={addItem}>
    Add first item
  </cf-button>
</cf-empty-state>
```

---

## cf-text

Generic text primitive for non-label typography: captions, helper copy,
metadata, descriptions. Use `cf-label` only when text labels a specific
control.

- `variant` — typography role: `caption`, `body-compact`, `body` (default),
  `body-large`, `heading-sm`, `heading-md`, `heading-lg`
- `tone` — semantic color: `default`, `muted`, `tertiary`, `disabled`,
  `primary`, `success`, `warning`, `error`
- `block` — render as block text instead of inline text
- `truncate` — clip overflowing text to a single line with an ellipsis. Use
  instead of ad-hoc
  `style="overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"`.
  `truncate` implies block display, so combining it with `block` is allowed
  but redundant. The host also gets `min-width: 0` so it shrinks and
  truncates correctly inside flex rows like `cf-hstack`.

```tsx
// Shown inside a pattern body.
// Truncated note next to fixed-width siblings in a row
<cf-hstack gap="2" align="center">
  <cf-text truncate tone="muted">{item.notes}</cf-text>
  <cf-badge size="xs">{item.status}</cf-badge>
</cf-hstack>
```

---

## cf-vstack / cf-hstack

Vertical and horizontal flexbox stacks. Shared layout props:

- `gap` — space between items (`0`–`24` numeric scale or `xs`–`xl`)
- `align` / `justify` — flexbox alignment
- `reverse` — reverse the direction (`wrap` is cf-hstack only)
- `padding` — uniform padding around the stack (same scale as `gap`)
- `px` / `py` — horizontal / vertical axis padding (same scale)
- `pt` / `pr` / `pb` / `pl` — single-side padding (same scale)

Padding precedence: single-side props (`pt`/`pr`/`pb`/`pl`) override the axis
props (`px`/`py`) on their side, which override the uniform `padding`. Use
these instead of inline `style="padding-top: ..."` overrides.

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
// Uniform padding, but tighter on top
<cf-vstack gap="2" padding="4" pt="2">
  {items}
</cf-vstack>

// Axis-only padding
<cf-hstack gap="2" px="4" py="1">
  {toolbarButtons}
</cf-hstack>
```

### Events

| Event | Detail | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `cf-click` | `{ lat, lng }` | Map background clicked |
| `cf-bounds-change` | `{ bounds, center, zoom }` | Viewport changed |
| `cf-marker-click` | `{ marker, index, lat, lng }` | Marker clicked |
| `cf-marker-drag-end` | `{ marker, index, position, oldPosition }` | Marker drag completed |
| `cf-circle-click` | `{ circle, index, lat, lng }` | Circle clicked |

**Note:** Polylines do not emit click events. For clickable segments, use circles as waypoints.

### Usage

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
// Simple: Display locations
const mapData = {
  markers: stores.map(store => ({
    position: { lat: store.lat, lng: store.lng },
    title: store.name,
    icon: "📍"
  }))
};
<cf-map $value={mapData} fitToBounds />

// Interactive: Click to add marker
<cf-map
  $value={mapData}
  oncf-click={(e) => {
    markers.push({
      position: { lat: e.detail.lat, lng: e.detail.lng },
      title: "New Location",
      draggable: true
    });
  }}
/>

// Draggable markers
<cf-map
  $value={mapData}
  oncf-marker-drag-end={(e) => {
    markers.key(e.detail.index).key("position").set(e.detail.position);
  }}
/>

// Coverage areas with circles
const mapData = {
  circles: areas.map(area => ({
    center: { lat: area.lat, lng: area.lng },
    radius: area.radiusMeters,
    color: area.available ? "#22c55e" : "#ef4444",
    fillOpacity: 0.2,
    title: area.name
  }))
};

// Route visualization
const mapData = {
  polylines: [{
    points: route.waypoints,
    color: "#3b82f6",
    strokeWidth: 4
  }],
  markers: [
    { position: route.start, icon: "🚀" },
    { position: route.end, icon: "🏁" }
  ]
};
```

### Events

| Event | Detail | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `cf-hover` | `{ x, y, dataX, dataY, nearest }` | Mouse over chart |
| `cf-click` | `{ x, y, dataX, dataY, nearest }` | Chart clicked |
| `cf-leave` | `{}` | Mouse left chart |

### Usage

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
// Sparkline (inline, no axes)
<cf-chart height={24} style="width: 80px;">
  <cf-line-mark $data={trend} color="green" />
</cf-chart>

// Line chart with axes
<cf-chart height={200} xAxis yAxis>
  <cf-line-mark $data={prices} x="date" y="price" color="blue" label="AAPL" />
</cf-chart>

// Layered area + line
<cf-chart height={200} xAxis yAxis>
  <cf-area-mark $data={prices} x="date" y="price" color="blue" opacity={0.15} />
  <cf-line-mark $data={prices} x="date" y="price" color="blue" />
</cf-chart>

</cf-chart>

// Simple number array (auto-indexed x)
<cf-chart height={100}>
  <cf-line-mark $data={[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6]} color="#22c55e" />
</cf-chart>
```

### Notes

- **Data auto-detection:** Number arrays auto-index. String x-values use band scale. Date/ISO strings use time scale.
- **Responsive width:** Chart fills its container width. Use CSS to control.
- **Crosshair:** Enabled by default. Shows nearest data point on hover.

## Identity components

**Render a person with the identity components — never a bare name string or a
raw `<img>`.** A display name alone is forgeable, hard to recognize at a glance,
and inaccessible. These components give consistent treatment, an accessible name,
and (for the current viewer) a verified seal that user-space cannot forge.

| You are showing… | Use | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **any participant** whose live profile cell you hold — the viewer (via `wish`) or anyone who contributed their cell on join | `cf-profile-badge` bound to that cell | trusted; draws name + avatar + a DID-derived verified seal; cross-space reads resolve for every viewer (CT-1667/1687) |
| a person you hold **only a snapshot** for — a self-contained piece, or an offline remote profile space | `cf-avatar` + their name | untrusted fallback, safe for any value; needs no profile cell |

`cf-profile-badge` is the one preferred way to render an identity; `cf-avatar` is
the explicit fallback for when no live profile cell is available. See
[multi-user-patterns → Presenting Identity](../patterns/multi-user-patterns.md#presenting-identity)
for the end-to-end flow (resolve the viewer, store each joiner's profile cell, mark "me").

### cf-avatar

Untrusted avatar primitive — safe for any code to render, for any person.

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
<cf-avatar name="Ada Lovelace" src={person.avatar} size="sm" /> // data: URI image
<cf-avatar name="Grace Hopper" src="🦊" />                       // emoji glyph
<cf-avatar name="Alan Turing" />                                 // initials "AT"
```

- `src`: a `data:` URI image, an emoji/glyph, or `""`. **Only `data:` URIs render
  as an image** — `http(s)`, `blob:`, and path URLs degrade to initials and are
  never fetched (no tracking/exfil beacon).
- `name`: drives the initials fallback and the accessible label — always set it.
- `size`: `xs | sm | md | lg | xl`. `shape`: `circle | square`.

Use `cf-avatar` as the **fallback** when you hold only a snapshot of a person — a
self-contained piece, or a participant whose remote profile space is offline. When
you have the live profile cell (which you do for every participant who joined by
contributing it), prefer `cf-profile-badge`.

### cf-profile-badge

Trusted presentation of **a participant's profile** — the viewer's own, or anyone
whose profile cell you stored on join. Bind a profile **cell** (not strings) via
`$profile`; it renders name + avatar + a verified seal derived from the owner's
identity that user-space cannot mint.

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
const profileWish = wish({ query: "#profile" }); // resolves the viewer's profile cell
const profile = resultOf(profileWish.result);
...
<cf-profile-badge $profile={profile} size="sm" />
```

- `$profile`: a profile **cell** — the viewer's own is
  `resultOf(wish({ query: "#profile" }).result)`; for other participants, bind
  the profile cell they contributed to the shared roster on join.
- `size`: `xs | sm | md | lg | xl`.
- The verified seal only appears for a live, runtime-attested profile cell (it
  will not show in stories or `--no-run` checks — that is expected, not a failure).
- **Every participant** with a stored profile cell can be badged — not just the
  viewer. Cross-space profile reads resolve for any authorized viewer (CT-1667/1687),
  so store each person's `#profile` cell in the shared `PerSpace` roster on join and
  bind `$profile={p.profile}`. See
  [multi-user-patterns → Presenting Identity](../patterns/multi-user-patterns.md#presenting-identity)
  and the live demo `packages/patterns/profile-roster-live-demo.tsx`. Only fall back
  to `cf-avatar` when you deliberately hold just a snapshot.
- ⚠️ **Bind it at a STATIC `[UI]` position.** Like every `$`-bidirectional binding
  (`$value`, `$checked`, …), `$profile` must be bound where the JSX is constructed
  once — **never inside a `{computed(() => …)}` subtree**. Inside a computed the
  cell is auto-unwrapped to a plain value and the renderer throws *"Bidirectionally
  bound property $profile is not reactive"*, blanking the whole pattern. Resolve
  `wish({query:"#profile"})` once, project its result with `resultOf()`, and place
  the badge in the static JSX; gate only its *siblings* reactively, or use
  `ifElse(cond, staticA, staticB)` as a child of a static wrapper. Repro:
  `packages/patterns/scope-bug-computed-vnode-blank/`.

## CFC Authorship

`cf-cfc-authorship` can enforce text-integrity policy for its children when
`verifyTextIntegrity` is set. If `requiredTextIntegrity` or `requiredIntegrity`
is provided, the renderer uses that explicit atom list.

When no explicit requirement is provided and `$author`/`author` is a cell whose
root CFC label contains `represents-principal`, the renderer infers a required
`{ kind: "authored-by", subject }` atom from that author cell. This means a
cell-backed author can make previously display-only text require matching
authorship integrity. Use an explicit `requiredTextIntegrity` when a component
needs a different policy, and avoid cell-backed `$author` for purely decorative
author names.
