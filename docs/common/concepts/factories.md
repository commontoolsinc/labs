# First-Class Factories

`pattern()`, `lift()`, and `handler()` return callable factory values. A
module-scoped factory is also a serializable Fabric value when the compiler can
give it a content-addressed artifact identity. It can be passed through pattern
inputs, returned from patterns, stored in cells or pieces, and loaded again
without introducing a wrapper class.

The public types are `PatternFactory`, `ModuleFactory`, and `HandlerFactory`.
Ordinary JavaScript functions are not serializable Fabric values.

Factory slots require a constructed factory, not a plain arrow function. Wrap
the callback in the matching `pattern(...)`, `lift(...)`, or `handler(...)`
builder so the compiler can attach its serializable artifact and schemas.

## Passing and invoking factories

Use the factory's normal call syntax. If the callee comes from a pattern input,
cell, property, or array element, the transformer lowers the call to a reactive
factory node. Replacing that value tears down the previous generation while
retaining the call site's output identity.

```tsx
import { ModuleFactory, pattern } from "commonfabric";

interface Input {
  value: number;
  transform: ModuleFactory<{ value: number }, number>;
}

export default pattern<Input>(({ value, transform }) => ({
  result: transform({ value }),
}));
```

The same value passed to a `lift` or `handler` callback arrives as an ordinary
materialized callable. If its code is cold, the runner delays only that
consumer until the artifact is ready.

## Returning and storing factories

Factory types may appear in input and output schemas and inside arrays and
objects:

```tsx
import { handler, HandlerFactory, pattern, Writable } from "commonfabric";

const append = handler<{ text: string }, { rows: Writable<string[]> }>(
  ({ text }, { rows }) => rows.push(text),
);

export interface Output {
  appendFactory: HandlerFactory<
    { rows: Writable<string[]> },
    { text: string }
  >;
}

export default pattern<{}, Output>(() => ({ appendFactory: append }));
```

Canonical Fabric storage encodes the value as `Factory@1`. Context-free decode
produces an inert callable shell; only a runner may materialize it into
executable code. A factory must have a durable compiler artifact ref before it
can cross a durable boundary.

When a factory is copied by value into another space, the runner publishes its
verified content-addressed source closure with the containing write. Warm
closures preserve synchronous speculative visibility; a cold closure delays
only ordered server submission, not the authored setter or local commit.
Cells and links remain opaque aliases rather than snapshots of their current
factory value.

## Inline pattern closures

An inline pattern may capture values from its surrounding pattern:

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
const searchTool = pattern(({ query }: { query: string }) =>
  searchIndex({ query, entries })
);
```

`query` is public input. `entries` is private closure state. The transformer
keeps them separate: public input is callback argument 0 and generated closure
params are callback argument 1. They are never merged, even if both contain the
same field name.

The transformed code uses `withPatternParamsSchema(callback, schema)` and a
private one-shot `.curry(params)` operation. `.curry` is transformer-only: it is
not in the public API, takes exactly one argument, and cannot bind twice. To add
another layer of partial application, write another inline pattern closure.

Reactive `map`, `filter`, and `flatMap` callbacks use the same mechanism. New
lowering passes one bound pattern factory to `*WithPattern`; captured values are
not passed as sibling params.

## Tool values

A `PatternFactory` is directly usable as an LLM, CLI, or FUSE tool. Optional
metadata wraps the factory without changing its public input:

```tsx
// Shown for illustration only.
const tools = {
  direct: searchTool,
  described: {
    pattern: searchTool,
    description: "Search the current index",
  },
};
```

`patternTool` and the `extraParams` entry in LLM tool maps have been removed.
Put tool-specific state in an inline `pattern(...)` closure and pass the
resulting factory directly (or use the `{ pattern, description }` metadata
form above). Do not pass the captured values beside the factory.

Factory-slot types compare the complete public input contract. In particular,
`Default<>` is part of that contract: a factory declared with a bare
`Default<"">` input is narrower than a slot accepting arbitrary `string`.
Prefer the normal `string | Default<"">` spelling and make the factory and slot
input types agree exactly.

Mounted tools appear as `*.tool`. FUSE JSON projections use the tagged Fabric
codec, not function source, a legacy `toJSON()` graph, or an implementation
descriptor. CLI/FUSE help and argument parsing first materialize trusted
artifact metadata, omit `FrameworkProvided` paths, and inject those values from
the stable containing tool Cell identity at invocation.

## Trust boundary

Factory state contains the complete builder artifact ref, never `$implRef`.
`$implRef` is used only inside instantiated execution-module descriptors.
`FrameworkProvided` paths come from trusted compiler/artifact metadata and may
not be supplied by Factory state, authored input, or closure captures.
