# New Storage Backend Implementation Plan

This document tracks the implementation of the new storage backend described in
`docs/specs/storage/*`.

Summary and code links

- Status: Heads, PIT, Snapshots, Branching, CAS, Queries, basic UCAN, and
  Toolshed route scaffolding are implemented; remaining items are TX pipeline
  invariants and final route wiring behind a flag.
- Flags (defaults): ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE=0, ENABLE_SERVER_MERGE=0.
- Provider entry: packages/storage/src/provider.ts
- SQLite modules (current layout under `store/` and `query/`):
  - Core store: `packages/storage/src/store/*` including `db.ts`, `schema.sql`,
    `heads.ts`, `change.ts`, `pit.ts`, `projection.ts`, `snapshots.ts`,
    `branches.ts`, `cas.ts`, `chunks.ts`, `tx.ts`, `tx_chain.ts`, `merge.ts`,
    `bytes.ts`, `crypto.ts`, `cache.ts`
  - Query: `packages/storage/src/query/*` including `sqlite_storage.ts`, IR/eval
  - WS: `packages/storage/src/ws/*`
- Toolshed routes (flagged): packages/toolshed/routes/storage/new/* and flag
  plumbing in packages/toolshed/env.ts
- CLI tasks: packages/storage/deno.json and packages/storage/cli/*
- Specs: docs/specs/storage/*.md (API, PIT, branching, snapshots, tx processing,
  invariants, queries)

## Goals

- Implement Automerge-backed `doc:` storage first (documents, branches, heads),
  then layer content-addressed primitives where needed.
- Provide query, subscription, and snapshot capabilities.
- WebSocket-only API (WS v2): deprecate HTTP routes; all commands over a single
  WS per space.
- Integrate with Toolshed to expose HTTP endpoints for the storage API.

## Status snapshot (current repo)

- `packages/storage` exists with public types in `interface.ts` and a provider
  factory.
- In-memory prototype and tests were removed; we will build directly on SQLite.
- Specs cover schema, PIT, transactions, branching, snapshots,
  queries/subscriptions, UCAN, and operations.

## Non-goals (for initial cut)

- Multi-region replication.
- Advanced query optimizations.
- Full UCAN integration beyond basic token validation.

## Milestones & Acceptance Criteria

- Each task group lands with unit tests and `deno task check` passing.
- Toolshed routes behind an `ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE=1` flag initially. HTTP routes
  will be deprecated in favor of the WS v2 endpoint.
- API surface documented and aligned to `docs/specs/storage/03-api.md`.

## Implementation map (spec → modules)

- SQLite provider: `packages/storage/src/sqlite/*` implements `SpaceStorage`
  over per-space DB files with PRAGMAs (§02).
- Change decoding and heads: `change.ts`, `heads.ts` use `@automerge/automerge`
  to parse headers and update heads (§01, §02, §04).
- PIT & projection: `store/pit.ts`, `store/projection.ts` implement
  snapshot+chunk fast-path and fallback (§05, §07). PIT signature simplified to
  `(db, docId, branchId, targetSeq)`.
- Transactions & crypto chain: `store/tx.ts`, `store/tx_chain.ts` implement
  pipeline, digests, and signatures (§04). JSON cache writes are factored into
  `store/cache.ts` and invoked post-commit.
- CAS primitives: `store/cas.ts` over `am_change_blobs` and friends (§02, §06).
- Branching/merge: `store/branches.ts` for creation/closure; merge synthesis is
  centralized in `store/merge.ts` and used by both provider and tx pipeline.
- Snapshots: `store/snapshots.ts` with cadence policies and pruning (§07).
- Queries/subscriptions: `query_ir.ts`, `query_eval.ts`, `query_ws.ts` and SQL
  tables in §11 (§08–§12).
- UCAN: `ucan.ts` to validate cap and nb digests (§13).
- Toolshed routes: `packages/toolshed/routes/storage/new/*` for HTTP and WS
  (§03, §08).

### Runtime performance notes (query read path)

- Added a per-version JSON cache (writes via `store/cache.ts`) used by
  `query/sqlite_storage.ts` for the `read()` and `readDocAtVersion()` methods.
  The cache is keyed by `${docId}\u0001${branchId}\u0001${seq}` and avoids
  repeatedly calling `Automerge.load()`/`Automerge.toJS()` for the same document
  version during query evaluation. This significantly reduces the cost of
  traversals with higher link budgets and prevents superlinear slowdowns in
  recursive VDOM validations observed in benchmarks.
- Follow-up: consider an LRU cap and/or invalidation hooks on write paths to
  bound memory in long-lived server processes.

### Query traversal/budgeting semantics (updated)

- Replaced per-hop depth budgeting with a global visit cap enforced via the
  evaluator's `VisitContext.seenIRDocPath` set. The cap prevents traversal
  explosion across all dimensions (fanout, depth, cycles) without tying cache
  keys to a numeric budget.
  - Default: `DEFAULT_VISIT_LIMIT = 16,384` unique `(IR, doc, path)` visits per
    evaluation.
  - Behavior: When the limit is reached, the evaluator returns
    `MaybeExceededDepth` (conservative) rather than recursing further.
- `EvalKey` no longer includes a `budget` field, and provenance keys have been
  simplified accordingly (now keyed by `(ir, doc, path)`).
- Removed the previous budget-based fast-memoization path; the global visit cap
  and standard memoization are sufficient and avoid key proliferation.

### Benchmarks (updated)

- Benchmarks in `packages/storage/bench/query_bench.ts` no longer vary a
  traversal budget. Two recursive cases were added to better represent real
  workloads under the global visit cap:
  - "vdom: recursive validation over many nodes (full pass)": validates many
    VDOM nodes against a recursive schema.
  - "schema: recursive traversal across task edges": exercises recursive graph
    traversal along `value.edges`.

## Detailed Task List (SQLite-first)

### 0. Package skeleton (done)

- [x] Create `packages/storage` package with basic exports and placeholder
      provider factory.
- [x] Add this plan document.
- [x] Register package in root `deno.json` workspace.

### 1. SQLite core (schema + heads-first)

- [x] Dependencies: add `npm:@automerge/automerge`
- [x] DB lifecycle: per-space DB file management, PRAGMAs, and connection pool
      (single writer).
- [x] Migrations: implement `02-schema.md` tables and indexes; idempotent
      startup.
- [ ] Heads path:
  - [x] Decode Automerge change bytes → `change_hash`, `deps`, `actor_id`,
        `seq`.
  - [x] Verify deps subset of current heads; update heads
        `(heads − deps) ∪ {hash}`.
  - [x] Reject if any `dep` missing for `(doc, branch)`.
  - [x] Enforce `actor_id`/`seq` monotonicity per actor in branch history.
  - [x] CAS: store change bytes (dedup) in `am_change_blobs`; index rows in
        `am_change_index`.
  - [x] Maintain `am_heads(seq_no, tx_id, heads_json, root_hash)` (root_hash
        placeholder for now).

Acceptance:

- Unit tests cover head updates (linear change, fork, merge), dep missing, and
  actor/seq monotonicity.

Current: linear, fork, and client-merge tests implemented; missing-dep covered;
actor/seq monotonicity enforced; CAS write and indexing implemented.

### 2. Point-in-time (PIT) and projection (DONE)

- [x] 2a) Full snapshot cadence and storage
- [x] 2b) Emit incremental chunks on submit; PIT uses chunks after last snapshot

- [x] Compute `upto_seq_no` for epoch/tx via `am_change_index`.
- [x] PIT reconstruction:
  - [x] Fast path from `am_snapshots` + `am_chunks` → concatenated AM binary.
  - [x] Fallback from snapshot + apply changes via `Automerge.applyChanges()`.
- [x] Projection helper `project(docBytes, paths[])` for selective subtrees.

Acceptance:

- [x] PIT byte equality with a client-generated doc at the same point.
- [x] Projection tests for path subsets and root.

Implementation:

- `packages/storage/src/sqlite/pit.ts` implements PIT reconstruction with both
  fast path and fallback
- `packages/storage/src/sqlite/projection.ts` implements JSON projection for
  selective subtrees
- Updated `packages/storage/interface.ts` to include `at?: string` for
  timestamp-based PIT
- Updated `packages/storage/src/provider.ts` to integrate PIT and projection
  functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage in
  `packages/storage/test/pit-and-projection-test.ts`

### 3. Branching and merge semantics (DONE)

- [x] Create/close branches; lineage metadata.
- [x] Client-driven merge: accept merge change with deps = heads to collapse
      branches; validate sources.
- [x] Optional server merge (flagged) using `Automerge.merge` to synthesize
- [x] Close branch post-merge; set `merged_into_branch_id`.

Acceptance:

- Tests: fork → concurrent edits → client-merge collapses heads; optional
  server-merge path works under flag.

Implementation:

- Added `packages/storage/src/sqlite/branches.ts` with `createBranch()` and
  `closeBranch()` built on existing heads/doc helpers; records
  `parent_branch_id` and `merged_into_branch_id`.
- Added `packages/storage/test/branches-basic-test.ts` covering creating a new
  branch and ensuring reads work after closing.

### 4. Snapshots (SQLite-backed) — DONE

- [x] Implement snapshot cadence and storage in `am_snapshots` / `am_chunks`.
  - [x] Full snapshots via `Automerge.save()`.
  - [x] Optional incremental chunks to accelerate PIT.
- [x] Integrity: maintain `root_ref = referJSON({ heads: sorted(heads) })` in
      `am_heads` for verification.

Acceptance:

- Snapshot/restore tests; integrity check matches stored `root_ref`.

Implementation:

- Added `packages/storage/src/sqlite/snapshots.ts` with `maybeCreateSnapshot()`
  using a basic cadence (default 5 changes) and storing full snapshots with
  upto_seq_no.
- Wired snapshot creation into submitTx() after heads update.
- Added `packages/storage/test/snapshots-basic-test.ts` ensuring cadence
  triggers and PIT returns the latest state.

### 5. Transactions (multi-doc) and invariants

- [ ] Tx request format and types wired through provider.
- [ ] Server pipeline:
  - [ ] Validate read-set heads.
  - [ ] Validate baseHeads vs current heads (unless merge path).
  - [ ] Validate each change: deps, actor/seq, duplicate hash.
  - [ ] Update heads and append sequence rows atomically.
  - [ ] Compute digests (`merkle-reference`) for UCAN `nb`.
  - [ ] Run invariants with `loadDocAt` and `project`, fail-closed.
- [ ] Receipts: new heads, counts, conflicts, crypto envelope fields stubbed
      until §4 completes.

Acceptance:

- Tests: valid tx, concurrent write conflict, idempotent replays.

### 6. Content-addressed primitives (SQLite CAS) — DONE

- [x] CAS interface over SQLite tables:
  - [x] `put(kind, bytes, meta?) -> digest`, `get(digest) -> {kind,bytes,meta}`,
        `has(digest)` using `am_change_blobs` for changes and `cas_blobs` for
        snapshots/generic blobs.
  - [x] Record kinds: `am_change`, `am_snapshot`, `blob`.
- [x] Indexes: `am_change_index` lookups by `(docId, branchId, seqNo)` and
      `(docId, branchId, txId)`; JSON meta indexes on `cas_blobs`.

Acceptance:

- Unit tests for CAS and indexes added at
  `packages/storage/test/sqlite/cas_test.ts`.

### 7. Queries and subscriptions

- [x] Query IR compiler and evaluator with provenance/touch set tracking.
- [x] Link traversal semantics and depth budgeting.
- [x] Subscription tables from §11 and WS server handling; at-least-once with
      acks. New WS v2 endpoint at `/api/storage/new/v2/:space/ws` multiplexes
      `get`, `subscribe`, and `tx`. Deliver frames are untied to RPC jobs;
      initial snapshot completion is signaled via a task/return `complete` tied
      to the invoking job. Resume via last acked `deliveryNo`.

Acceptance:

- Query tests: filters, sorts, limits, joins/reference traversals.
- Subscription tests: multiple consumers, ordering, no duplication, reconnect
  resume.

### 8. UCAN / Access control (MVP)

- [x] Minimal UCAN validation and capability checks.
- [x] Enforce space-level caps on tx and read endpoints.
- [ ] WS v2: enforce UCAN at upgrade or first invocation; for tx, verify per-tx
      signature + delegation chain; bind receipts to crypto chain.

Acceptance:

- Authorized vs unauthorized attempts covered by tests.

### 9. Toolshed integration (flagged)

- [x] Add routes under `packages/toolshed/routes/storage/new/` for docs/branches
      heads, tx, PIT read, query, subscribe, snapshots; use `doc:<ref>` and
      `root_ref` in responses.
- [ ] Deprecate HTTP routes in favor of the WS v2 endpoint; keep Toolshed HTTP
      helpers only for PIT/snapshots if needed.
- [x] Gate on `ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE`.

Acceptance:

- Route tests passing; feature flag works.

### 10. Tooling (no migration needed)

- [x] CLI for exporting/importing snapshots and listing spaces/branches.

Acceptance:

- Docs updated; happy-path flows verified in tests.

Usage examples:

- List spaces (under $SPACES_DIR or ./.spaces): deno task
  new-storage:list-spaces

- List branches in a space: deno task new-storage:list-branches -- --space
  my-space

- Export a snapshot (Automerge binary) at a given seq to a file: deno task
  new-storage:export-snapshot -- --space my-space --doc my-doc --branch main
  --seq 12 --out ./my-doc-main-12.am

- Import a snapshot file for fast PIT (records in am_snapshots and CAS): deno
  task new-storage:import-snapshot -- --space my-space --doc my-doc --branch
  main --file ./my-doc-main-12.am

```

## Dependency additions

- `npm:@automerge/automerge` — change parsing, apply/save.
- use `@db/sqlite` for SQLite in Deno (replaces earlier `node:sqlite` note)
- Reuse `identity` package for Ed25519 where possible.

## Testing & CI

- Unit tests per module; integration tests for tx, PIT, branches, snapshots,
  queries.
- Web WS tests via `packages/deno-web-test` harness where applicable.
- Bench basic write/read throughput; snapshot cadence behavior.

## Rollout & flags

- `ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE=1` gates Toolshed routes.
- `ENABLE_SERVER_MERGE=0` default; can be enabled per-space for testing.
- Ship SQLite provider alongside in-memory for fallback/testing.

## Open Questions

- Snapshot cadence/retention defaults.
- Server-side merge scope; when to synthesize merge changes.
- Binary subscription stream format and ergonomics.

## Implementation notes (phase 2 kickoff)

- Existing SQLite backend modules to reuse/extend:
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/db.ts — SQLite open/PRAGMAs/migrations
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/heads.ts — heads state, root_ref, branch/doc
    init
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/change.ts — decode Automerge change headers
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/pit.ts — PIT reconstruction (epochForTimestamp,
    uptoSeqNo, getAutomergeBytesAtSeq)
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/snapshots.ts — snapshot cadence
    (DEFAULT_CADENCE=5), writes am_snapshots
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/branches.ts — create/close branches with lineage
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/projection.ts — JSON projection for selective
    paths
  - packages/storage/src/provider.ts — SpaceStorage implementation and submitTx
- CAS tables/primitives already referenced:
  - am_change_blobs (bytes dedup) and am_change_index (per-branch index) used in
    submitTx and PIT fallback.
  - Follow-up: factor a sqlite/cas.ts wrapper if we expand beyond change blobs
    (snapshots, generic blobs).
- Provider submitTx implementation:
  - packages/storage/src/provider.ts: submitTx performs dep checks, per-actor
    seq monotonicity, CAS insert into am_change_blobs, index in am_change_index,
    updates am_heads (including root_ref via merkle-reference/json), and
    triggers maybeCreateSnapshot().
- PIT, snapshots, and projection (spec alignment):
  - Spec refs: docs/specs/storage/05-point-in-time.md (§05) and 07-snapshots.md
    (§07).
  - Implementation: sqlite/pit.ts and sqlite/snapshots.ts match the described
    fast-path and fallback; projection helper exists.
- Merge semantics / branching:
  - Spec ref: docs/specs/storage/06-branching.md (§06).
  - Implementation: `store/branches.ts`; client-driven merges validated by
    submitTx logic (deps ⊆ heads). Server merge synthesis is available behind a
    flag and implemented in `store/merge.ts`.
- Query spec references for later phases:
  - docs/specs/storage/09-query-ir.md, 10-query-evaluation.md,
    11-query-schema.md, 12-query-types.md (IR, evaluation algorithm, schema,
    types).
  - No runtime modules checked in yet; to be implemented under sqlite/query_*.ts
    per plan.
- Invariants:
  - Spec ref: docs/specs/storage/14-invariants.md (§04 numbering in plan);
    provider submitTx currently lacks invariant hooks; to add during Tx pipeline
    work.
- Toolshed/WS and feature flags:
  - WS v2 implemented in `packages/storage/src/ws/*`; Toolshed mounts new routes
    behind `ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE=1`.
- Baseline execution (on this branch):
  - deno task check: PASSED.
  - deno test --allow-env --allow-ffi --allow-read --allow-write: FAILED early
    due to an import map issue in a mirrored .conductor/kolkata path (Relative
    import not in import map). Storage package tests themselves compile; full
    workspace run requires fixing or excluding those mirrored paths.

Action items for phase 2 (expanded):

- [ ] Transactions
  - [x] Enforce all-or-nothing semantics for multi-doc transactions (implemented
        in `store/tx.ts`).
    - [x] Add focused tests to verify rollback when any doc fails within a tx
          and that receipts reflect aggregated failures.
  - [x] Add invariant hooks (pre-commit) with a clear interface to validate
        materialized state per write; fail the entire tx on invariant violation.

- [ ] Merge identity and semantics
  - [x] Unify merge identity using a consistent header decoder
        (`decodeChangeHeader`) in all codepaths (implemented in
        `store/merge.ts`).
  - [ ] Define/document server merge actor identity policy (e.g., dedicated
        server actor id); add tests for actor/seq correctness of synthesized
        merges.

- [ ] PIT determinism and behavior
  - [ ] Confirm and document deterministic PIT reconstruction (ordering by
        `seq_no`).
  - [x] Add tests to assert identical bytes across reconstructions given the
        same `upto_seq_no`, even when index plans change.

- [x] Prepared statements rollout (performance)
  - [x] Introduce prepared statement caching for hot-path queries beyond
        `store/tx.ts`:
    - [x] `store/heads.ts` (reads and updates).
    - [x] `store/pit.ts` (snapshot/chunk/changes scans).
    - [x] `store/cache.ts` upsert and `query/sqlite_storage.ts` reads.

- [x] API layering and consistency
  - [x] Centralize SQL timestamp snippet as a constant and use everywhere
        (`store/sql.ts`).
  - [x] Move per-space toggles (e.g., chunking, cadence) behind `config.ts`
        accessors; make `store/flags.ts` delegate.
  - [x] Create a `store/index.ts` facade exporting a curated API to reduce
        import complexity and cycles.

- [ ] Logging and observability
  - [ ] Adopt the shared logger across PIT, snapshots, heads, and WS modules;
        gate verbose logs by `LOG_LEVEL`.
  - [ ] Add counters/histograms for:
    - [ ] Applied changes per tx; conflicts/rejections.
    - [ ] Snapshot creations and chunk emissions.
    - [ ] PIT fast-path vs fallback use.
    - [ ] WS deliveries (sent/dropped/acked) — when subscription refactor lands.

- [x] SQL/schema
  - [x] Verify and document required indexes (added in `004_perf_indexes.sql`):
    - [x] `am_change_index` on `(branch_id, actor_id, seq_no)`,
          `(branch_id, change_hash)`, `(doc_id, branch_id, seq_no)`.
    - [x] `am_chunks` on `(doc_id, branch_id, seq_no)` for PIT fast-path.
    - [x] `subscription_deliveries` on `(subscription_id, delivery_no)` and
          `(subscription_id, acked, delivery_no)`.
    - [x] `json_cache` PK/unique on `(doc_id, branch_id)`.

- [ ] Testing
  - [x] JSON cache tests: verify tip reads utilize cache, historical reads
        bypass, and cache updates on write.
  - [ ] WS resume/acks test: unskip and fix ordering issues; ensure deliveries
        resume from last ack.
  - [ ] Merge actor/seq tests for synthesized merges.
  - [x] PIT determinism tests.

- [x] Developer experience and documentation
  - [x] Update specs (`03-api.md`, `04-transactions.md`, `05-point-in-time.md`,
        `06-branching.md`) to reflect:
    - [x] All-or-nothing tx semantics and invariant hooks.
    - [x] Merge actor policy and deterministic PIT behavior.
  - [x] Refresh this plan to mark completed items and track remaining work.

### WS v2 Tasks (summary)

- [x] Define WS v2 protocol types (Invocation, Authorization, UCAN, TaskReturn,
      Deliver, Ack, Complete)
- [x] Implement WS v2 handler in `packages/storage` with `get`/`subscribe` and
      `complete` as task/return
- [x] Untie Deliver frames from RPC jobs; persist acks and resume
- [x] Wire `/storage/tx` over WS and return task/return receipt
- [x] Base64 encode/decode change bytes for WS tx
- [ ] Stream initial snapshot rows via Deliver before `complete`
- [x] Enforce UCAN at upgrade/first invocation (read capability on space)
- [ ] Verify per-tx signature + delegation chain
- [ ] Client helpers for UCAN-wrapped calls and ack batching
- [x] Integration tests: get-only complete; basic subscribe+deliver+ack; tx over
      WS
- [ ] Integration test (resume with acks): fix enqueue/pump ordering after
      reconnect; currently skipped. Re-enable once fixed.
- [ ] Remove/deprecate HTTP routes from docs and codepaths (retain PIT if
      needed)
- Add invariant hook points within submitTx pipeline and basic invariant
  examples.
- Consider sqlite/cas.ts wrapper for CAS beyond change blobs.
- Resolve deno test import-map issue or restrict default test set to avoid
  mirrored .conductor paths.

## Cleanup tasks

- [x] Links are wrong, they are json pointer but should be string[]
- [x] Rationalize seqId vs txId use
- [x] Remove InMemoryStorage in query/
  - [x] First remove the dependency on it in cycle_test.ts and others
- [ ] Can we use :memory; instead of temp directories?
- [x] Rename `Storage` class inside query to something more like ReadHelper
- [x] Rename `sqlite` directory into something more meaningful
