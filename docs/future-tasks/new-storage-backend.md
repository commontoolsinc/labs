# New Storage Backend Implementation Plan

This document tracks the implementation of the new storage backend described in
`docs/specs/storage/*`.

Summary and code links

- Status: Heads, PIT, Snapshots, Branching, CAS, Queries, basic UCAN, and
  Toolshed route scaffolding are implemented; remaining items are TX pipeline
  invariants and final route wiring behind a flag.
- Flags (defaults): ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE=0, ENABLE_SERVER_MERGE=0.
- Provider entry: packages/storage/src/provider.ts
- SQLite modules: packages/storage/src/sqlite/db.ts, schema.sql, heads.ts,
  change.ts, pit.ts, projection.ts, snapshots.ts, branches.ts, cas.ts,
  query_ir.ts, query_eval.ts
- Toolshed routes (flagged): packages/toolshed/routes/storage/new/* and flag
  plumbing in packages/toolshed/env.ts
- CLI tasks: packages/storage/deno.json new-storage:* and packages/storage/cli/*
- Specs: docs/specs/storage/*.md (API, PIT, branching, snapshots, tx processing,
  invariants, queries)

## Goals

- Implement Automerge-backed `doc:` storage first (documents, branches, heads),
  then layer content-addressed primitives where needed.
- Provide query, subscription, and snapshot capabilities.
- WebSocket-only API (WS v2): deprecate HTTP routes; all commands over a single
  WS per space.
- Integrate with Toolshed to expose HTTP endpoints for the storage API.

## Status snapshot (current repo)

- `packages/storage` exists with public types in `interface.ts` and a provider
  factory.
- In-memory prototype and tests were removed; we will build directly on SQLite.
- Specs cover schema, PIT, transactions, branching, snapshots,
  queries/subscriptions, UCAN, and operations.

## Non-goals (for initial cut)

- Multi-region replication.
- Advanced query optimizations.
- Full UCAN integration beyond basic token validation.

## Milestones & Acceptance Criteria

- Each task group lands with unit tests and `deno task check` passing.
- Toolshed routes behind an `ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE=1` flag initially. HTTP routes
  will be deprecated in favor of the WS v2 endpoint.
- API surface documented and aligned to `docs/specs/storage/03-api.md`.

## Implementation map (spec → modules)

- SQLite provider: `packages/storage/src/sqlite/*` implements `SpaceStorage`
  over per-space DB files with PRAGMAs (§02).
- Change decoding and heads: `change.ts`, `heads.ts` use `@automerge/automerge`
  to parse headers and update heads (§01, §02, §04).
- PIT & projection: `pit.ts`, `projection.ts` implement snapshot+chunk fast-path
  and fallback (§05, §07).
- Transactions & crypto chain: `tx.ts`, `tx_chain.ts` implement pipeline,
  digests, and signatures (§04).
- CAS primitives: `cas.ts` over `am_change_blobs` and friends (§02, §06).
- Branching/merge: `branches.ts` for creation/closure/merge semantics (§06).
- Snapshots: `snapshots.ts` with cadence policies and pruning (§07).
- Queries/subscriptions: `query_ir.ts`, `query_eval.ts`, `query_ws.ts` and SQL
  tables in §11 (§08–§12).
- UCAN: `ucan.ts` to validate cap and nb digests (§13).
- Toolshed routes: `packages/toolshed/routes/storage/new/*` for HTTP and WS
  (§03, §08).

### Runtime performance notes (query read path)

- Added a per-version JSON cache in
  `packages/storage/src/query/sqlite_storage.ts` for the `read()` and
  `readDocAtVersion()` methods. The cache is keyed by
  `${docId}\u0001${branchId}\u0001${seq}` and avoids repeatedly calling
  `Automerge.load()`/`Automerge.toJS()` for the same document version during
  query evaluation. This significantly reduces the cost of traversals with
  higher link budgets and prevents superlinear slowdowns in recursive VDOM
  validations observed in benchmarks.
  - Follow-up: consider an LRU cap and/or invalidation hooks on write paths to
    bound memory in long-lived server processes.

### Query traversal/budgeting semantics (updated)

- Replaced per-hop depth budgeting with a global visit cap enforced via the
  evaluator's `VisitContext.seenIRDocPath` set. The cap prevents traversal
  explosion across all dimensions (fanout, depth, cycles) without tying cache
  keys to a numeric budget.
  - Default: `DEFAULT_VISIT_LIMIT = 16,384` unique `(IR, doc, path)` visits per
    evaluation.
  - Behavior: When the limit is reached, the evaluator returns
    `MaybeExceededDepth` (conservative) rather than recursing further.
- `EvalKey` no longer includes a `budget` field, and provenance keys have been
  simplified accordingly (now keyed by `(ir, doc, path)`).
- Removed the previous budget-based fast-memoization path; the global visit cap
  and standard memoization are sufficient and avoid key proliferation.

### Benchmarks (updated)

- Benchmarks in `packages/storage/bench/query_bench.ts` no longer vary a
  traversal budget. Two recursive cases were added to better represent real
  workloads under the global visit cap:
  - "vdom: recursive validation over many nodes (full pass)": validates many
    VDOM nodes against a recursive schema.
  - "schema: recursive traversal across task edges": exercises recursive graph
    traversal along `value.edges`.

## Detailed Task List (SQLite-first)

### 0. Package skeleton (done)

- [x] Create `packages/storage` package with basic exports and placeholder
      provider factory.
- [x] Add this plan document.
- [x] Register package in root `deno.json` workspace.

### 1. SQLite core (schema + heads-first)

- [x] Dependencies: add `npm:@automerge/automerge`
- [x] DB lifecycle: per-space DB file management, PRAGMAs, and connection pool
      (single writer).
- [x] Migrations: implement `02-schema.md` tables and indexes; idempotent
      startup.
- [ ] Heads path:
  - [x] Decode Automerge change bytes → `change_hash`, `deps`, `actor_id`,
        `seq`.
  - [x] Verify deps subset of current heads; update heads
        `(heads − deps) ∪ {hash}`.
  - [x] Reject if any `dep` missing for `(doc, branch)`.
  - [x] Enforce `actor_id`/`seq` monotonicity per actor in branch history.
  - [x] CAS: store change bytes (dedup) in `am_change_blobs`; index rows in
        `am_change_index`.
  - [x] Maintain `am_heads(seq_no, tx_id, heads_json, root_hash)` (root_hash
        placeholder for now).

Acceptance:

- Unit tests cover head updates (linear change, fork, merge), dep missing, and
  actor/seq monotonicity.

Current: linear, fork, and client-merge tests implemented; missing-dep covered;
actor/seq monotonicity enforced; CAS write and indexing implemented.

### 2. Point-in-time (PIT) and projection (DONE)

- [x] 2a) Full snapshot cadence and storage
- [x] 2b) Emit incremental chunks on submit; PIT uses chunks after last snapshot

- [x] Compute `upto_seq_no` for epoch/tx via `am_change_index`.
- [x] PIT reconstruction:
  - [x] Fast path from `am_snapshots` + `am_chunks` → concatenated AM binary.
  - [x] Fallback from snapshot + apply changes via `Automerge.applyChanges()`.
- [x] Projection helper `project(docBytes, paths[])` for selective subtrees.

Acceptance:

- [x] PIT byte equality with a client-generated doc at the same point.
- [x] Projection tests for path subsets and root.

Implementation:

- `packages/storage/src/sqlite/pit.ts` implements PIT reconstruction with both
  fast path and fallback
- `packages/storage/src/sqlite/projection.ts` implements JSON projection for
  selective subtrees
- Updated `packages/storage/interface.ts` to include `at?: string` for
  timestamp-based PIT
- Updated `packages/storage/src/provider.ts` to integrate PIT and projection
  functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage in
  `packages/storage/test/pit-and-projection-test.ts`

### 3. Branching and merge semantics (DONE)

- [x] Create/close branches; lineage metadata.
- [x] Client-driven merge: accept merge change with deps = heads to collapse
      branches; validate sources.
- [x] Optional server merge (flagged) using `Automerge.merge` to synthesize
- [x] Close branch post-merge; set `merged_into_branch_id`.

Acceptance:

- Tests: fork → concurrent edits → client-merge collapses heads; optional
  server-merge path works under flag.

Implementation:

- Added `packages/storage/src/sqlite/branches.ts` with `createBranch()` and
  `closeBranch()` built on existing heads/doc helpers; records
  `parent_branch_id` and `merged_into_branch_id`.
- Added `packages/storage/test/branches-basic-test.ts` covering creating a new
  branch and ensuring reads work after closing.

### 4. Snapshots (SQLite-backed) — DONE

- [x] Implement snapshot cadence and storage in `am_snapshots` / `am_chunks`.
  - [x] Full snapshots via `Automerge.save()`.
  - [x] Optional incremental chunks to accelerate PIT.
- [x] Integrity: maintain `root_ref = referJSON({ heads: sorted(heads) })` in
      `am_heads` for verification.

Acceptance:

- Snapshot/restore tests; integrity check matches stored `root_ref`.

Implementation:

- Added `packages/storage/src/sqlite/snapshots.ts` with `maybeCreateSnapshot()`
  using a basic cadence (default 5 changes) and storing full snapshots with
  upto_seq_no.
- Wired snapshot creation into submitTx() after heads update.
- Added `packages/storage/test/snapshots-basic-test.ts` ensuring cadence
  triggers and PIT returns the latest state.

### 5. Transactions (multi-doc) and invariants

- [ ] Tx request format and types wired through provider.
- [ ] Server pipeline:
  - [ ] Validate read-set heads.
  - [ ] Validate baseHeads vs current heads (unless merge path).
  - [ ] Validate each change: deps, actor/seq, duplicate hash.
  - [ ] Update heads and append sequence rows atomically.
  - [ ] Compute digests (`merkle-reference`) for UCAN `nb`.
  - [ ] Run invariants with `loadDocAt` and `project`, fail-closed.
- [ ] Receipts: new heads, counts, conflicts, crypto envelope fields stubbed
      until §4 completes.

Acceptance:

- Tests: valid tx, concurrent write conflict, idempotent replays.

### 6. Content-addressed primitives (SQLite CAS) — DONE

- [x] CAS interface over SQLite tables:
  - [x] `put(kind, bytes, meta?) -> digest`, `get(digest) -> {kind,bytes,meta}`,
        `has(digest)` using `am_change_blobs` for changes and `cas_blobs` for
        snapshots/generic blobs.
  - [x] Record kinds: `am_change`, `am_snapshot`, `blob`.
- [x] Indexes: `am_change_index` lookups by `(docId, branchId, seqNo)` and
      `(docId, branchId, txId)`; JSON meta indexes on `cas_blobs`.

Acceptance:

- Unit tests for CAS and indexes added at
  `packages/storage/test/sqlite/cas_test.ts`.

### 7. Queries and subscriptions

- [x] Query IR compiler and evaluator with provenance/touch set tracking.
- [x] Link traversal semantics and depth budgeting.
- [x] Subscription tables from §11 and WS server handling; at-least-once with
      acks. New WS v2 endpoint at `/api/storage/new/v2/:space/ws` multiplexes
      `get`, `subscribe`, and `tx`. Deliver frames are untied to RPC jobs;
      initial snapshot completion is signaled via a task/return `complete` tied
      to the invoking job. Resume via last acked `deliveryNo`.

Acceptance:

- Query tests: filters, sorts, limits, joins/reference traversals.
- Subscription tests: multiple consumers, ordering, no duplication, reconnect
  resume.

### 8. UCAN / Access control (MVP)

- [x] Minimal UCAN validation and capability checks.
- [x] Enforce space-level caps on tx and read endpoints.
- [ ] WS v2: enforce UCAN at upgrade or first invocation; for tx, verify per-tx
      signature + delegation chain; bind receipts to crypto chain.

Acceptance:

- Authorized vs unauthorized attempts covered by tests.

### 9. Toolshed integration (flagged)

- [x] Add routes under `packages/toolshed/routes/storage/new/` for docs/branches
      heads, tx, PIT read, query, subscribe, snapshots; use `doc:<ref>` and
      `root_ref` in responses.
- [ ] Deprecate HTTP routes in favor of the WS v2 endpoint; keep Toolshed HTTP
      helpers only for PIT/snapshots if needed.
- [x] Gate on `ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE`.

Acceptance:

- Route tests passing; feature flag works.

### 10. Tooling (no migration needed)

- [x] CLI for exporting/importing snapshots and listing spaces/branches.

Acceptance:

- Docs updated; happy-path flows verified in tests.

Usage examples:

- List spaces (under $SPACES_DIR or ./.spaces): deno task
  new-storage:list-spaces

- List branches in a space: deno task new-storage:list-branches -- --space
  my-space

- Export a snapshot (Automerge binary) at a given seq to a file: deno task
  new-storage:export-snapshot -- --space my-space --doc my-doc --branch main
  --seq 12 --out ./my-doc-main-12.am

- Import a snapshot file for fast PIT (records in am_snapshots and CAS): deno
  task new-storage:import-snapshot -- --space my-space --doc my-doc --branch
  main --file ./my-doc-main-12.am

```

## Dependency additions

- `npm:@automerge/automerge` — change parsing, apply/save.
- use `@db/sqlite` for SQLite in Deno (replaces earlier `node:sqlite` note)
- Reuse `identity` package for Ed25519 where possible.

## Testing & CI

- Unit tests per module; integration tests for tx, PIT, branches, snapshots,
  queries.
- Web WS tests via `packages/deno-web-test` harness where applicable.
- Bench basic write/read throughput; snapshot cadence behavior.

## Rollout & flags

- `ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE=1` gates Toolshed routes.
- `ENABLE_SERVER_MERGE=0` default; can be enabled per-space for testing.
- Ship SQLite provider alongside in-memory for fallback/testing.

## Open Questions

- Snapshot cadence/retention defaults.
- Server-side merge scope; when to synthesize merge changes.
- Binary subscription stream format and ergonomics.

## Implementation notes (phase 2 kickoff)

- Existing SQLite backend modules to reuse/extend:
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/db.ts — SQLite open/PRAGMAs/migrations
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/heads.ts — heads state, root_ref, branch/doc
    init
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/change.ts — decode Automerge change headers
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/pit.ts — PIT reconstruction (epochForTimestamp,
    uptoSeqNo, getAutomergeBytesAtSeq)
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/snapshots.ts — snapshot cadence
    (DEFAULT_CADENCE=5), writes am_snapshots
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/branches.ts — create/close branches with lineage
  - packages/storage/src/sqlite/projection.ts — JSON projection for selective
    paths
  - packages/storage/src/provider.ts — SpaceStorage implementation and submitTx
- CAS tables/primitives already referenced:
  - am_change_blobs (bytes dedup) and am_change_index (per-branch index) used in
    submitTx and PIT fallback.
  - Follow-up: factor a sqlite/cas.ts wrapper if we expand beyond change blobs
    (snapshots, generic blobs).
- Provider submitTx implementation:
  - packages/storage/src/provider.ts: submitTx performs dep checks, per-actor
    seq monotonicity, CAS insert into am_change_blobs, index in am_change_index,
    updates am_heads (including root_ref via merkle-reference/json), and
    triggers maybeCreateSnapshot().
- PIT, snapshots, and projection (spec alignment):
  - Spec refs: docs/specs/storage/05-point-in-time.md (§05) and 07-snapshots.md
    (§07).
  - Implementation: sqlite/pit.ts and sqlite/snapshots.ts match the described
    fast-path and fallback; projection helper exists.
- Merge semantics / branching:
  - Spec ref: docs/specs/storage/06-branching.md (§06).
  - Implementation: sqlite/branches.ts; client-driven merges validated by
    submitTx logic (deps ⊆ heads); optional server-merge remains TODO/flagged.
- Query spec references for later phases:
  - docs/specs/storage/09-query-ir.md, 10-query-evaluation.md,
    11-query-schema.md, 12-query-types.md (IR, evaluation algorithm, schema,
    types).
  - No runtime modules checked in yet; to be implemented under sqlite/query_*.ts
    per plan.
- Invariants:
  - Spec ref: docs/specs/storage/14-invariants.md (§04 numbering in plan);
    provider submitTx currently lacks invariant hooks; to add during Tx pipeline
    work.
- Toolshed route scaffolding and feature flags:
  - packages/toolshed/routes/storage/new/* present (new.index.ts, new.routes.ts,
    new.handlers.ts) — currently wired to a Map-backed SpaceStorage placeholder
    and throws until SQLite provider is injected.
  - Feature flag not yet plumbed; propose ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE in
    packages/toolshed/env.ts and conditional router mounting in
    packages/toolshed/index.ts/create-app.
- Baseline execution (on this branch):
  - deno task check: PASSED.
  - deno test --allow-env --allow-ffi --allow-read --allow-write: FAILED early
    due to an import map issue in a mirrored .conductor/kolkata path (Relative
    import not in import map). Storage package tests themselves compile; full
    workspace run requires fixing or excluding those mirrored paths.

Action items for phase 2:

- Add ENABLE_NEW_STORAGE env flag and gate Toolshed new storage routes.
- Provide a SpaceStorage factory that opens per-space SQLite (openSpaceStorage)
  and inject into Toolshed handlers.
- Implement WS v2 handler inside `packages/storage` and route
  `/api/storage/new/v2/:space/ws`.
- Add client helpers for UCAN-wrapped invocations; base64-encode change bytes in
  tx over WS.
- Update specs in `docs/specs/storage` for WS v2 wire format (get, subscribe,
  tx, deliver, complete, ack). Deprecate HTTP API surface.

### WS v2 Tasks (summary)

- [x] Define WS v2 protocol types (Invocation, Authorization, UCAN, TaskReturn, Deliver, Ack, Complete)
- [x] Implement WS v2 handler in `packages/storage` with `get`/`subscribe` and `complete` as task/return
- [x] Untie Deliver frames from RPC jobs; persist acks and resume
- [x] Wire `/storage/tx` over WS and return task/return receipt
- [x] Base64 encode/decode change bytes for WS tx
- [ ] Stream initial snapshot rows via Deliver before `complete`
- [ ] Enforce UCAN at upgrade/first invocation; verify per-tx signature + delegation chain
- [ ] Client helpers for UCAN-wrapped calls and ack batching
- [ ] Integration tests: get-only complete; subscribe resume with acks; tx receipt assertions
- [ ] Remove/deprecate HTTP routes from docs and codepaths (retain PIT if needed)
- Add invariant hook points within submitTx pipeline and basic invariant
  examples.
- Consider sqlite/cas.ts wrapper for CAS beyond change blobs.
- Resolve deno test import-map issue or restrict default test set to avoid
  mirrored .conductor paths.

## Cleanup tasks

- [x] Links are wrong, they are json pointer but should be string[]
- [x] Rationalize seqId vs txId use
- [x] Remove InMemoryStorage in query/
  - [x] First remove the dependency on it in cycle_test.ts and others
- [ ] Can we use :memory; instead of temp directories?
- [x] Rename `Storage` class inside query to something more like ReadHelper
- [x] Rename `sqlite` directory into something more meaningful
