reason: "Record of the measurement #7439 reports, run again at e1bbc1d549 on main after #7480: each figure against #7439's, the demand without boardNames, and a prototype pivot row holding topic identities as strings."

# A topic's demand over its board, measured again on main

#7439 reports what one topic's declared demand over its Topics board reaches:
the documents the memory server's graph query returns when it is rooted at that
topic's argument document under the schema recorded on the topic's argument
link. This record runs that measurement again at `e1bbc1d549` on `main`, whose
history includes #7480, and compares each figure with the figure #7439's body
and comments report for the same input and member count. It also measures the
demand with `boardNames` removed from it, which storing a member's name on the
member allows, and one prototype of the row shape #7439 names as its fix: a
pivot row carrying identity as a value rather than as a reference.

The work is on the local branch `experiment/7439-remeasure`. Its base, the
presence of #7480 in that base, and the branch's commits up to the one holding
the last output quoted here:

```

A block shows what a command printed or what a file contains. It cannot show
when something was done, or that something was not done, so statements of those
kinds rest on the author's account. Among them: that the archived script is the
one #7439's figures came from; that the runs were made on 2026-09-15; that
storing a member's name on the member was decided on 2026-09-15; that no
deployed space or toolshed was contacted, read-only calls included; that nothing
was pushed; and every statement that something was not measured, compared or
tried.

Each block of output is quoted as printed, with two kinds of trim, named where
each is used: terminal color codes removed, and a `sed` or `grep` in the quoted
command that kept only some lines. Commands ran at the root of the worktree
unless the section says otherwise.

## The answers

- **The counts #7439 reports are the same; the byte figures are not.** On the
  board as it stands, the `boardCrossrefs` and `boardNames` roots each reach N −
  1 other topics at N = 4, 10, 20 and 40, and the `mentionable` root reaches
  none, as #7439 reports. Every byte figure is lower than #7439's, and an
  other-topic document is 37,784 to 37,785 bytes here against 63,284 to 63,285
  there (§ Comparison with #7439).
- **With `boardNames` removed, the demand still reaches N − 1 other topics** on
  the board as it stands, at every N and density measured (§ With `boardNames`
  removed).
- **The prototype row brings `boardCrossrefs` to no other topic** at every N and
  density measured, while `boardNames` reaches N − 1 in the same store (§ The
  prototype's figures). `mentionable` reaches no other topic on either board,
  and the prototype does not change it. On the prototype board with `boardNames`
  also removed, the whole argument walk reaches a number of other topics equal
  to the density: none at density 0, and 2 at density 2 at every N (§ With
  `boardNames` removed).

## Setup

The command that produced `02-ladder.stdout.txt` and `02-ladder.stderr.txt` is
named in the message of the commit that holds them:

```
$ git log -1 --format=%B 451886f918
experiment(topics): demand of one topic over its board, both boards

Output of `deno run -A packages/patterns/topics/measure-topic-demand.ts
4:2 10:2 20:2 40:2 10:0 10:1 10:3 10:6`, run at 8a029b7dab, exit 0.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_01Kp8NcNXPougGPyJCEyYtob
```

That this command produced those two files, and exited 0, rests on the author's
account: no committed file records the invocation. The run also prints the
commit it ran at, the worktree's status, its arguments, the store, and the
experimental options, both those read from the environment and those the first
board's runtime resolved:

```
$ sed -n 1,10p packages/patterns/topics/demand-runs/02-ladder.stdout.txt
# git rev-parse HEAD: 8a029b7dab92615f6d4a26bc72176a6e12ba26fa
# git status --short at start:

# deno 2.9.4
# arguments: ["4:2","10:2","20:2","40:2","10:0","10:1","10:3","10:6"]
# arms: current=main.tsx rows=main-rows.tsx

# experimental options read from the environment: {}
# runtime.experimental (resolved, first board): {"modernCellRep":false,"commitPreconditions":true,"plainResultReceipts":true,"computedCellIds":true,"lazyMaterialization":true,"serverExecution":false,"contentAddressedSchemas":true,"readerSchemaPrecedence":true}
```

Each argument is `<N>:<density>`: #7439's member counts N = 4, 10, 20 and 40 at
density 2, and N = 10 at densities 0, 1, 3 and 6. Each argument builds two
boards, each in its own store: `current`, which is `main.tsx` as it stands, and
`rows`, which is `main-rows.tsx` (§ The prototype files). The rig files N topics
through `addTopic`, and then each topic sends `mention` for the next `density`
topics, wrapping, so topic 0 is mentioned by `density` topics:

```
$ git show 8a029b7dab:packages/patterns/topics/measure-topic-demand.ts | sed -n '/const addTopic = result.key("addTopic");/,/await runtime.storageManager.synced();/p'
  const addTopic = result.key("addTopic");
  for (let n = 1; n <= size; n++) {
    await addTopic.pull();
    await runtime.editWithRetry((tx) =>
      addTopic.withTx(tx).send({
        title: `Topic ${n}`,
        body: `Body of topic ${n}. ${"x".repeat(400)}`,
        agentName: "probe",
      })
    );
  }
  await runtime.idle();

  const topics = result.key("topics");
  await topics.pull();
  const listed = topics.get() ?? [];
  if (listed.length !== size) {
    throw new Error(`expected ${size} topics, board holds ${listed.length}`);
  }

  stage(arm, size, density, "mention");
  const topicCells: Json[] = [];
  for (let index = 0; index < size; index++) {
    topicCells.push(topics.key(index).resolveAsCell());
  }
  for (let from = 0; from < size; from++) {
    for (let step = 1; step <= density; step++) {
      const to = (from + step) % size;
      if (to === from) continue;
      const stream = topicCells[from].key("mention");
      await stream.pull();
      await runtime.editWithRetry((tx) =>
        stream.withTx(tx).send({ topic: topicCells[to] })
      );
    }
  }
  await runtime.idle();
  await runtime.storageManager.synced();
```

```

The lines the measurement rests on are the same in the archived rig, committed
unchanged as `5a3b020f43`, and in the rig that ran, `8a029b7dab`: the store, the
loopback session, the query, the whole-walk selector at `path: []`, the
per-input selector, and the byte count:

```
$ for ref in 5a3b020f43 8a029b7dab; do echo "=== $ref"; git show "$ref:packages/patterns/topics/measure-topic-demand.ts" | grep -n -E 'const bytesOf|new TextEncoder\(\)\.encode\(JSON\.stringify|StorageManager\.emulate\(|loopback\(|client\.mount\(space, \{\}, testSessionOpenAuthFactory\)|session\.queryGraph\(\{ roots \}\)|selector: \{ path: \[\], schema|path: \[\.\.\.\(link\.path|schema: withoutAsCell\(deref\(propertySchema\)\)'; done
=== 5a3b020f43
40:const bytesOf = (value: unknown) =>
41:  new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(value)).length;
60:  const storageManager = StorageManager.emulate({ as: signer });
170:        path: [...(link.path ?? []) as string[]],
171:        schema: withoutAsCell(deref(propertySchema)),
180:    transport: MemoryV2Client.loopback(candidate.server()!),
182:  const session = await client.mount(space, {}, testSessionOpenAuthFactory);
204:    const frame = await session.queryGraph({ roots });
216:    selector: { path: [], schema: argumentLink.schema },
=== 8a029b7dab
67:const bytesOf = (value: unknown) =>
68:  new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(value)).length;
121:  const storageManager = StorageManager.emulate({ as: signer });
268:        path: [...(link.path ?? []) as string[]],
269:        schema: withoutAsCell(deref(propertySchema)),
278:    transport: MemoryV2Client.loopback(candidate.server!()),
280:  const session = await client.mount(space, {}, testSessionOpenAuthFactory);
317:    const frame = await session.queryGraph({ roots });
368:    query([{ id: argumentLink.id, selector: { path: [], schema } }]);
```

The whole walk is rooted at topic 0's argument document under the schema
recorded on its argument link (`as recorded`). A per-input query is rooted at
the document one input's stored link names, under that input's property schema
with the top-level `asCell` and `asStream` markers removed. Bytes are the UTF-8
length of the returned documents serialized as JSON, which is not a byte count
on the wire; an empty result is `[]`, 2 bytes. Each figure is one query, not a
resume.

A returned document counts as another topic's by two rules. The rail rule, the
`others`, `topics`, `otherBytes` and `share` columns of the run's figures table
and the `oth` columns of the comparison, counts a document whose id is the
result document, or the argument or pattern rail document, of a topic other than
topic 0. The family rule, the `famDoc` to `famShr` columns, also counts a
document whose chain of `result` backlinks reaches such a topic's result
document:

```
$ git show 8a029b7dab:packages/patterns/topics/measure-topic-demand.ts | sed -n '/Whose document is whose, by id/,/const others = entities.filter/p'
  // Whose document is whose, by id: the result document and the argument and
  // pattern rail documents of the board and of each topic. An id two of them
  // name is recorded as `shared` and counted as nobody's.
  const owner = new Map<string, string>();
  const note = (id: string, who: string) => {
    const known = owner.get(id);
    owner.set(id, known === undefined || known === who ? who : "shared");
  };
  const railsNoted: Record<string, number> = {};
  const noteFamily = (cell: Json, who: string) => {
    note(cell.getAsNormalizedFullLink().id, who);
    railsNoted.result = (railsNoted.result ?? 0) + 1;
    for (const rail of ["argument", "pattern"] as const) {
      const link = getMetaLink(cell, rail);
      if (link === undefined) continue;
      note(link.id, who);
      railsNoted[rail] = (railsNoted[rail] ?? 0) + 1;
    }
  };
  noteFamily(resultCell, "board");
  topicCells.forEach((cell, index) =>
    noteFamily(cell, index === 0 ? "self" : `other${index}`)
  );
  const topicResultIds = new Map<string, string>(
    topicCells.map((cell, index) => [
      cell.getAsNormalizedFullLink().id,
      index === 0 ? "self" : `other${index}`,
    ]),
  );
  const boardResultId = resultCell.getAsNormalizedFullLink().id;

  const shareOf = (part: number, whole: number, count: number) =>
    count === 0 ? "0.0%" : `${(100 * part / whole).toFixed(1)}%`;

  const query = async (roots: Json[]): Promise<Figures> => {
    const frame = await session.queryGraph({ roots });
    const entities = frame.entities as Json[];
    // Each returned document's `result` backlink, where it carries one.
    const backlink = new Map<string, string>();
    for (const entity of entities) {
      const raw = entity.document?.result;
      if (raw === undefined) continue;
      const link = parseLink(raw, { ...argumentLink, id: entity.id, path: [] });
      if (link?.id !== undefined) backlink.set(entity.id, link.id);
    }
    const familyOf = (id: string): string | undefined => {
      const seen = new Set<string>();
      let current: string | undefined = id;
      while (current !== undefined && !seen.has(current)) {
        const byId = owner.get(current);
        if (byId !== undefined) return byId;
        seen.add(current);
        const parent = backlink.get(current);
        if (parent === undefined) return undefined;
        const topic = topicResultIds.get(parent);
        if (topic !== undefined) return topic;
        if (parent === boardResultId) return "board";
        current = parent;
      }
      return undefined;
    };
    const others = entities.filter((entity) =>
```

## What changed in the rig

The archived rig ran at `cbdf66c3cf`. Commits `a7ac8e4317` to `8a029b7dab`
changed it as follows.

- Two boards per argument, as § Setup describes.
- The `comparable` marker variants are removed; that marker is not re-tried
  here.
- The family rule, and a `shared` label for an id two topics' rails both name,
  which counts as nobody's.
- The whole walk is measured four ways: as recorded; as an inline copy of the
  recorded schema, which returns the same figures as the recorded schema in
  every row quoted in § The prototype's figures; without `boardNames`; and
  without `boardNames` and `boardCrossrefs`.
- A `mentionable` control naming the row's `piece` reference.
- Checks per board: the pivot's row count, topic 0's own row, and topic 0's
  `referencedBy`.
- The header above, and stage markers on standard error.
- `"internal"` is dropped from the rails the rail rule records.

The archived rig passed `"internal"` to `getMetaLink`. At `cbdf66c3cf`,
`META_LINK_FIELDS` already did not contain it, and no commit from there to the
base changed the number of occurrences of `"internal"` in that file, which is
what `git log -S` counts:

```
$ git show 5a3b020f43:packages/patterns/topics/measure-topic-demand.ts | grep -n 'for (const rail of'
188:    for (const rail of ["argument", "internal", "pattern"] as const) {
```

```
$ git show cbdf66c3cf:packages/runner/src/meta-seam.ts | sed -n 3,9p
export const META_LINK_FIELDS = Object.freeze(
  [
    "pattern",
    "argument",
    "result",
  ] as const,
);
$ git log --oneline -S'"internal"' cbdf66c3cf..e1bbc1d549 -- packages/runner/src/meta-seam.ts | wc -l
       0
```

So the message of commit `a7ac8e4317`, which says `internal` "is no longer a
meta link field", is wrong: it was not one at `cbdf66c3cf` either. What the
archived rig's call returned at `cbdf66c3cf` is not established.

A `schema: true` control on both tables was tried and dropped. The run printed
its header and no measurement line, and the last stage marker before the
rejection is the `schema true` query on the `boardCrossrefs` root. Color codes
removed:

```

`resolveScopeKey` in `packages/memory/v2.ts` raises that message for a
session-scoped read made with no principal, and the rig mounts its session
through `testSessionOpenAuthFactory`:

```
$ sed -n 140,160p packages/memory/v2.ts
export const resolveScopeKey = (
  scope: CellScope | undefined,
  identity: ScopeKeyIdentity,
): ScopeKey => {
  switch (scope ?? "space") {
    case "space":
      return "space";
    case "user":
      if (!identity.principal) {
        throw new ProtocolError(
          "user scoped memory operations require a principal",
        );
      }
      return `user:${encodeScopeKeyPart(identity.principal)}`;
    case "session":
      if (!identity.principal) {
        throw new ProtocolError(

        );
      }

280:  const session = await client.mount(space, {}, testSessionOpenAuthFactory);

A pivot row holds the identity of the topic it is about and the identities of
the topics that mention it, as the strings `identityOf` returns, and holds no
cell reference. `backlinksOf` compares strings, and `referencedBy` is those
strings. The pattern check printed no diagnostic. Color codes removed:

```

Task cf deno run --allow-run --allow-env --allow-read ./packages/cli/launcher.ts 'check' 'packages/patterns/topics/main-rows.tsx'

```

The recorded `boardCrossrefs` selector names a different item schema document on
the two boards, and the `mentionable` and `boardNames` selectors name the same
one on both:

```

Checks per board. `ownRowMentionedBy` is the length of topic 0's own row's
`mentionedBy`, `referencedBy` the length of topic 0's `referencedBy`, and
`rowIdsEqualTopicIds` compares the prototype's row identities with the topics'
ids:

On every board the pivot holds N rows, topic 0's own row is found, and both
lengths equal the density. On every prototype board the row identities equal the
topic ids. No id is labeled `shared`, no runtime error was recorded, and no
`pattern` rail link resolved on any board.

## Comparison with #7439

The figures in this section come from the run § Setup describes. Its command,
and the commit, arguments, store and runtime options the run printed:

```
$ git log -1 --format=%B 451886f918
experiment(topics): demand of one topic over its board, both boards

Output of `deno run -A packages/patterns/topics/measure-topic-demand.ts

The sections below are quoted from `03-compare-7439.txt`, printed by a script
that reads the run's measurement lines and holds #7439's figures typed in, each
labeled with where the issue states it. The commit that holds the output names
its command, and running that command again prints the committed file:

```
$ git log -1 --format=%B a06fd0ea66 | sed -n '1,/^$/d; /^Co-Authored-By/,$d; p'
The run's output also holds its selector schemas as JSON lines without
`checks`, so compare-7439.ts threw after table 0 and the output committed
in b7ac194790 stops there. The output here is the whole of
`deno run --allow-read packages/patterns/topics/demand-runs/compare-7439.ts`,
exit 0.

- `boardNames` and `boardCrossrefs` return the same other-topic documents and
  bytes on every board of the board as it stands. #7439 says the two reach the
  same documents "at the same byte counts"; here their other-topic bytes are
  equal and their frame bytes differ at every N (§ With `boardNames` removed).
- `mentionable` reaches no other topic on any board.
- `topic only` and `mentionedBy only` return the same documents and bytes at N =
  10 and 20 at density 2, where #7439 reports them the same, and at every
  density from 1. At density 0 they differ, which #7439 has no figure for:
  `topic only` reaches 9 other topics and `mentionedBy only` none (§ The
  prototype's figures, the density-0 block).
- #7439 says the only demand that avoids the follow does not name the property.
  Here `nothing named` on the `boardCrossrefs` root reaches no other topic, and
  naming `topic` or `mentionedBy` reaches 39 at N = 40 (§ The prototype's
  figures).
- The whole walk without `boardNames` reaches N − 1 other topics at every N, as
  #7439's statement that removing one of the two fixes nothing says.

### Needs and receives at N = 40

```
$ sed -n '/^## 5\./,/^$/p' packages/patterns/topics/demand-runs/03-compare-7439.txt
## 5. #7439 body: at N = 40 with inbound degree 2, needs 2 documents (~126,570 bytes), receives 39 (2,468,115 bytes); arm `current` now, whole as recorded
now: 2 documents ~75,570 bytes; receives 39 (1,473,615 bytes) | receives bytes -994,500
```

- #7439: a topic needs 2 documents, about 126,570 bytes, and receives 39,
  2,468,115 bytes. Here: 2 documents are about 75,570 bytes, and the topic
  receives 39, 1,473,615 bytes, 994,500 fewer.
- #7439's first comment: 39 documents and 2.47 MB on a 40-topic board, 90.5% of
  the frame. Here 39 documents and 1,473,615 bytes, 88.6% of the whole walk and
  90.4% of the `boardCrossrefs` root (§ The body table). The same comment's 9
  documents at N = 10 whether density is 0 or 6 is 9 here (§ Density at N = 10).

## With `boardNames` removed

The figures in this section come from the run § Setup describes. Its command,
and the commit, arguments, store and runtime options the run printed:

```
$ git log -1 --format=%B 451886f918

On the board as it stands, `current`:

- With `boardNames` removed, the whole walk still reaches 3, 9, 19 and 39 other
  topics at N = 4, 10, 20 and 40 at density 2, and 9 at N = 10 at every density.

On the prototype board, `rows`:

- With `boardNames` in the demand, the whole walk reaches N − 1 other topics, as
  the `boardNames` root alone does.
- With `boardNames` removed, the whole walk reaches 2 other topics at density 2
  at every N, from 86 documents and 156,999 bytes at N = 4 to 122 documents and
  181,149 bytes at N = 40, and 0, 1, 3 and 6 at N = 10 at densities 0, 1, 3 and
  6. At density 0 that is no other topic, 46 documents and 51,790 bytes, while
  the same board's whole walk as recorded reaches 9.

The per-input roots do not show which input the remaining other-topic documents
come from. In the two blocks of § The prototype's figures, the whole walk
without both `boardNames` and `boardCrossrefs` reaches the same count on both
boards: 2 at N = 40 at density 2, and none at N = 10 at density 0.

## The prototype's figures

The figures in this section come from the run § Setup describes. Its command,
and the commit, arguments, store and runtime options the run printed:

```
$ git log -1 --format=%B 451886f918
experiment(topics): demand of one topic over its board, both boards

Output of `deno run -A packages/patterns/topics/measure-topic-demand.ts

`boardCrossrefs` on the prototype board reaches no other topic at any N or
density: 18, 24, 34 and 54 documents and 16,886, 19,551, 23,991 and 32,912 bytes
at N = 4, 10, 20 and 40 (§ With `boardNames` removed). On the board as it
stands, the same root reaches N − 1.

The rows for N = 40 at density 2 and for N = 10 at density 0, from the run's
figures table. `row` and `refBy` are topic 0's own row and `referencedBy`:

- On the prototype board, the four demands on the `boardCrossrefs` root, from
  naming nothing to the recorded schema, return the same figures, and none
  reaches another topic. In the same store, the `boardNames` root reaches 39 and
  9 other topics, and `mentionable: piece named` 39 and 9.
- `mentionable` as declared reaches no other topic on either board, and
  `mentionable: piece named`, the same document under a demand naming the row's
  reference, reaches N − 1 on both. The prototype does not change `mentionable`
  (§ The prototype files), whose selector names the same schema document on both
  boards. The `mentionable` root's bytes differ between the two boards at every
  N (§ With `boardNames` removed).
- In every row of these two blocks, the family columns equal the rail columns.

The run wrote 274 lines to standard error: 224 stage markers, 15
`sync-load-failure` lines ending `memory client closed`, 32
`Can't load
profile-create.tsx` lines, and 3 `slow-traverse` warnings. No line
is a rejection. When the `sync-load-failure` lines were written relative to the
queries is not established.

## The comments #7439 names

#7439 cites `topic.tsx:1231`, `topic.tsx:476`, `naming.ts:96` and
`naming.ts:340`. At the base, the lines holding the text it quotes, and the
declarations that follow each:

```
$ grep -n -e 'surveying the whole table expands no topic at all' -e 'is that missing annotation' packages/patterns/topics/topic.tsx
493: * `ComparableCell` is that missing annotation. It does not change what an entry
1707: * so surveying the whole table expands no topic at all.
$ grep -n -e '^export interface TopicMentionSource' -e '^const backlinksOf' packages/patterns/topics/topic.tsx
497:export interface TopicMentionSource {
1714:const backlinksOf = lift((
$ grep -n -e 'expands no member it did not follow' -e 'surveying the whole table expands no member' packages/patterns/collection-naming/naming.ts
96: * one entry — expands no member it did not follow.
340: * and nothing more, so surveying the whole table expands no member.
$ grep -n -e '^export type NamesMap' -e '^export const ownName' packages/patterns/collection-naming/naming.ts
109:export type NamesMap = Record<string, unknown>;
342:export const ownName = lift(

## Stated limitations

- **A query, not a resume.** Each figure is one graph query rooted at one
  document. The runtime's own sync requests were not reproduced.
- **Bytes are not wire bytes.** A byte figure is the UTF-8 length of the
  returned documents as JSON.
- **Differences are named, not attributed.** No run at `cbdf66c3cf` is part of
  this record, so no difference from #7439's figures is attributed to a change
  between the two commits.
- **#7439's frame column names no root.** § The body table compares it with both
  candidates.
- **Other-topic documents are the ones two rules attribute.** A document a
  followed topic brings into the frame that neither rule attributes counts in
  `docs` and `bytes` and not in the other-topic columns, so a share is of
  attributed bytes. No `pattern` rail link resolved (§ The prototype files), and
  in the quoted rows the family rule attributes nothing the rail rule does not.
- **The archived rig's `internal` rail.** What the archived rig attributed at
  `cbdf66c3cf` through `"internal"` is not established (§ What changed in the
  rig).
- **The prototype is for measuring.** Its identity is an entity id, which
  identifies a topic only among topics of one space and scope. Its "Referenced
  by" list renders identities, not links. `identityOf` calls `resolveAsCell()`
  on each list entry inside the board's pivot, and what that adds to the pivot's
  reads was not measured. Its comments outside the regions that differ describe
  the originals. `cf check` of `main-rows.tsx` is the only check run on it; no
  pattern test was run against it.
- **The widest control is a demand naming a reference.** The `schema: true`
  control was refused (§ What changed in the rig).
- **One store per board.** Figures from different boards are compared as counts,
  and the returned documents' contents were not compared.
- **The density of #7439's table.** #7439's body states inbound degree 2 at N =
  40, and its first comment writes "2 at d=2". This record compares the table
  with density 2 at every N.
- **`comparable` was not re-tried.** #7447 states the result in the plan text it
  merged, `docs/plans/collection-naming-topics.md`, "What remains" item 2: "the
  `comparable` marker was measured to leave the document and byte counts
  unchanged". #7439's body reports the figures, at N = 20 (§ `as declared` at N
  = 20). The plan text at #7447's merge commit:

```
$ git log -1 --format='%h %s' 6d1bb61495
6d1bb61495 docs(collection-naming): the plan says what remains, and records the measurement it cites (#7447)
$ git show 6d1bb61495:docs/plans/collection-naming-topics.md | sed -n 43,52p
2. **A table handed to every member delivers every member's document whole**
   (#7439). Measured on Topics: a member's declared demand over `boardCrossrefs`
   or `boardNames` reaches every other member, 90.5% of the frame on a
   40-member board; the share grew with member count from 4 to 40, and at 10
   members the document and byte counts were unchanged across the mention
   densities measured. `unknown` bounds the walk's descent, not its delivery,
   and comments in `naming.ts` and `topic.tsx` say otherwise. The fix is a
   row-shape change: the `comparable` marker was measured to leave the document
   and byte counts unchanged. It touches the same inputs decision 14 touches,
   so the two belong in one pass.
