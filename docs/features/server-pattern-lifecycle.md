# Pattern lifecycle verbs on the serving runtime

Under server execution, the three verbs that give a space a pattern — upload
a program, instantiate a piece from it, and replace a piece's source — run
on the space's serving runtime. The client's part is to resolve the program
from disk and request; the serving side compiles, materializes or replaces,
and commits. This document is the contract for that: the route a client
calls, the authority it needs, where the verb runs, what comes back, and
what still happens on the client.

A source update carries module-update authority, which
[`module-loading.md`](../specs/module-loading.md) requires to be published
from an owned setup transaction that commits to storage itself. A serving
wave's acceptance is withdrawable until the wave commits, so the served
`setsrc` verb does not seal its setup transaction into the wave: the
transaction commits directly to the store, as one of the serving loop's own
commits made outside the wave ([Direct commits](#direct-commits) below), and
the update's authority registers from that verdict. `cf piece setsrc`
requests the verb; `cf piece setsrc --check` stays in the client's process,
since it writes nothing.

The verbs run only when `EXPERIMENTAL_SERVER_EXECUTION` selects the ON arm
([`EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS.md`](../development/EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS.md#serverexecution)).
Off the flag a deployment has no serving loop, the route answers 503, and
`cf` performs each verb in its own process as it always has. `cf test` runs
a whole stack in memory and is untouched either way.

## The route

Three POST endpoints under `/api/pattern-lifecycle`, mounted by
`packages/toolshed/routes/pattern-lifecycle/`. Every body carries `space`,
the DID of the space acted in. A verb that takes a pattern takes it one of
two ways, and exactly one: `program` — the program as the client resolved
it, every file by name, with `main`, an optional `mainExport`, optional
`sourceRoots`, and optional `dataFiles` — or `pattern`, a
`{ identity, symbol }` pointer to a closure the space already holds. A body
naming both or neither fails validation.

| verb          | body                                                                                              | receipt                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `upload`      | `program`                                                                                         | `{ pattern }` — the pointer the space now holds the program under                  |
| `instantiate` | `program` or `pattern`; optional `argument`, `repository`, `slug`, `force`, `register`, `start`   | `{ pieceId, pattern, slug? }`                                                      |
| `setsrc`      | `piece`; `program` or `pattern`; optional `repository`, `dangerouslyAllowIncompatibleSchema`, `expectedPattern`, `start` | `{ pieceId, pattern, revisionId, seq, detachedOrigin }` — the accepted setup transaction's receipt, `seq` its position in the space's commit log |

A refusal is a JSON body `{ error, code }`. `code` is stable and is what a
client branches on; `error` is prose for a person.

| status | code                                   | meaning                                                                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 401    | `unauthorized`                         | no valid first-party request proof                                           |
| 403    | `forbidden`                            | the caller is not a writer of the space, or there is no such space           |
| 404    | `pattern-not-found`, `piece-not-found` | the named pattern, or the named piece, is not in the space                   |
| 409    | `slug-taken`, `source-moved`           | the slug names something and `force` was not set; the piece is not on the pattern the update was proved against |
| 413    | `payload-too-large`                    | the body exceeds the limit, checked before authentication                    |
| 422    | `compile-failed`, `setup-failed`, `no-space-root`, `incompatible` | the program did not compile; setup refused the pattern or the argument; nothing to register the piece with; the candidate cannot run over the piece's retained state and the override was not set |
| 429    | `rate-limited`                         | the caller's request budget is spent, checked before authentication         |
| 500    | `internal`                             | the serving side failed for a reason it does not name                        |
| 503    | `server-execution-off`, `space-not-served` | no serving loop on this deployment; the space's lease is held elsewhere |

Body validation runs after authentication and answers 422 with the
validator's own body — a body naming both `program` and `pattern`, or
neither, fails there — so a client that sends what the schema describes never
sees it.

## Authority

Every call carries the CF1 first-party request proof
([`toolshed-access-control.md`](../specs/toolshed-access-control.md)), signed
with the caller's own identity key; `cf` signs with the identity it connects
as. The route then requires that DID to hold WRITE or OWNER on the space's
ACL, resolved the way the memory server resolves an authored commit — the
wildcard grant and the service principals count — so a caller the memory
server would admit writing directly is admitted here, and no other. A
deployment with ACL enforcement off admits every authenticated caller, as its
memory server does. One denial covers a malformed DID, a space the deployment
does not host, an absent ACL, and a caller without a grant, so the route is
not an existence oracle over the deployment's spaces.

The verb's own writes are the serving loop's, under the space's lease. The
instantiation transaction carries the requester's CFC trust snapshot, so a
label setup mints attributes to the requester rather than to the serving
identity.

## Where a verb runs

`ExecutorHost.runLifecycleVerb` hands a verb to the space's `SpaceServer`,
activating the space if it is parked. A verb request is an activation trigger
of its own: the requester holds no session on the space, so the criteria the
session-open and admission hooks consult do not apply. The `SpaceServer`
queues the verb and runs it as a step of its next wave cycle, after the
root ensure and ahead of the event drain, awaited in full, so every
transaction the verb seals joins that cycle's wave. The request settles once
the wave has committed and the verb's `confirm` step — a read of the durable
state the verb was to leave — has passed. A seal's acceptance is not
durability, since the wave commit can withdraw a contribution, and this is
what keeps a receipt from naming a piece that is not there. A space that
parks before a queued verb runs rejects it, and the host queues the verb
once more on the successor tenure.

A verb that stages a piece names the piece's root as its demand
(`LifecycleVerb.demandRoots`), and the loop takes every document the verb's
transactions wrote — the root, its argument, and the documents its computed
values live in — as warm demand for the tenure: the identity-less root key
the explicit warm request uses, which is what gets a piece derived that no
session demands. The verb's commit is the loop's own and never its input,
so once the wave has committed the loop re-announces those documents to
itself as a warm-marked notice, the carrier provisioning uses for the setup
it stages in another space; the next cycle takes it as input, its demand
pass loads the piece from the now-committed store, and the piece's first
runs seal into that cycle's wave.

The receipt does not wait for that derivation. It returns once the verb's
own wave has committed and `confirm` has read the piece back, which is the
point at which the piece is durable and can be resumed; the loop owes its
first run and serves it in the cycle after. A reader that needs the derived
value pulls it, which is demand the loop serves, rather than expecting a
creation to have run the graph.

The served creation takes the whole creation act into one transaction:
with `register`, the piece joins the space root's registry, and with `slug`
it is named — a name already pointing somewhere refuses the creation
outright unless `force` is set, so a refused creation leaves nothing
behind. `cf piece new` asks for both.

That seat rules out two things the client-side operations do. A transaction
the runtime seals into a wave cannot mint a durability receipt of its own, so
the runtime refuses `runSyncedWithCommit` while a seal destination is
installed unless the caller asks for a direct commit; and the storage
manager's full `synced()` waits on the wave commit the verb is inside of and
would deadlock. The served operations in
`packages/piece/src/ops/served-lifecycle.ts` therefore compose the lower
runner calls — `compileAndSavePattern`, and `setup` with a transaction the
verb stamps — and mint their receipts from what they wrote; the source
update is the exception, below.

### Direct commits

A transaction the serving runtime stamps `directCommit` (a `bookkeeping`
run's, `ServerRunInfo` in `packages/runner/src/runtime.ts`) does not seal
into the wave. The `SpaceServer` commits it to the store on its own, as a
derived-class commit under the space's lease, serialized with the wave's
seals; the transaction's `commit()` then resolves with the store's verdict,
and the receipt and authority the runner mints from that verdict claim
nothing a withdrawal can undo. The store validates the transaction's own
read set as it does a client commit's: every read is held to the seq this
replica had for the document, so a commit the store took but the replica
had not applied when the transaction read is a conflict, and every document
the transaction writes is held to the store seq the transaction was stamped
at. A read of state sealed into the open wave names
the durable basis beneath it. The replica takes the writes only once the
store has accepted them, so no run reads them as pending state a refusal
could roll back.

A wave open when the direct commit lands learns of it once the replica has
applied it. Its commit step treats a document the direct commit wrote,
sitting at exactly that commit's seq, as observed rather than conflicting
for a contribution sealed after the commit that read the document with the
commit applied and read none of the commit's documents before it, and holds
the store to that exact head when it commits. A contribution sealed before,
or one with no such read to show it saw the commit, keeps the ordinary
conflict, since its write may rest on state the commit replaced; one that
read a document as it stood before the commit is refused at its own commit
by the replica's claim check and never seals, and the wave holds such a read
to the same rule should one reach it. This is what lets a piece the update moved
re-derive in the same cycle, whether the loop's pointer watcher swaps a
piece it runs or the demand pass loads one the verb staged.

The served `setsrc` verb builds its update on that. It takes a pattern the
space already holds: a program sent with the request is compiled as an
`upload` verb of its own, so the closure is durable at that verb's wave
commit before the update's setup transaction reads and extends it, and the
update runs in the cycle after. The transaction is the client-side update's
— the pin against the pattern the update was proved on, the compatibility
assertions, the retained-argument validators, the source revision, and the
delegation the successor inherits — carrying the requester's trust snapshot
as a creation's does, committed directly, with the piece not started
here. A piece the loop runs is swapped by its pointer watcher; a
piece nothing runs waits for demand, and unless `start` is `false` the verb
names the piece's root as its demand so the cycle after derives it.

The `servingLoop.lifecycleVerbs` block of `/api/health/stats` counts verbs
whose run completed (`runs`) and verbs whose run threw or whose durable
confirmation failed (`failures`).

## What the client still does

The seed this implements records the direction as "client speculative-local,
server-state wins", and for `cf` there is nothing to speculate: the CLI
resolves the program locally — reading the files, pinning fabric imports —
and sends it. What `cf piece new` still does in its own process after the
receipt is what any client does when it opens a piece: it starts the piece,
which under the flag runs the graph as speculation while the serving loop
serves the derived values. `--no-start` skips that and sends `start: false`,
which leaves the piece set up and undemanded on the serving side too: the
loop derives it when something first demands it, not in the cycle after
the creation. The registry entry and the slug are part of the served
creation, and so is the space root the registry lives in: the serving loop
ensures the root on activation, ahead of the verb, so the client no longer
initializes it in its own process; a creation that finds no root is refused
with `no-space-root`. The request is awaited without a wall-clock bound,
since a creation the server is still committing lands whether or not the
client waits; the bound the client keeps is on its own start.

`cf piece setsrc` resolves the program the same way and sends it with the
piece's id; the receipt is the accepted setup transaction's. What the command
then does in its own process is what a client-side update does after its
commit: it starts the piece it holds, which under the flag runs the graph as
speculation while the serving loop serves the derived values, and reports
that refresh's outcome beside the receipt — a failed refresh is a non-zero
exit over a durable commit. A piece addressed at a scope keeps
the client-side path, since the verb takes the piece's id alone.

Other clients of the piece controller — the browser shell, the background
piece service — keep the client-side shape. Moving each is its own change;
the served operations and the route are what they move onto.

## Tests

- `packages/runner/test/executor-lifecycle-verbs.test.ts` — the queue: a verb
  activates a sessionless space and resolves once its write is durable, a
  failed run or a failed confirmation rejects and is counted, queued verbs run
  in order, and an inactive server refuses; and a direct commit is durable
  when its `commit()` resolves, refuses a document that moved past its
  stamp, and lets a piece it stages derive.
- `packages/runner/test/runner.test.ts` — `runSyncedWithCommit` issues a
  receipt while sealing when asked for a direct commit, and leaves the piece
  unstarted when told to.
- `packages/piece/test/served-lifecycle.test.ts` — the served operations
  against a real memory server and serving host, read back through a client
  runtime opened afterwards; for `setsrc`, the successor's authority over the
  predecessor registered on the serving runtime and stored in the closure a
  later runtime reads.
- `packages/toolshed/routes/pattern-lifecycle/` — the writer check against
  a real ACL document, the status each refusal maps to, and the middleware
  order in front of the handler.
- `packages/cli/test/pattern-lifecycle.test.ts` — the client's signing and
  refusal handling against a stubbed fetch; `packages/cli/test/piece-integration.test.ts`
  and `packages/cli/integration/integration.sh` drive the real verbs against
  a toolshed in both CI arms.
