# Collaborative fields

Collaborative fields let multiple editors change one stored value without
turning the owning Cell into a last-writer-wins document. Memory orders and
integrates versioned codec operations, stores their durable history, and writes
the resulting value through the ordinary entity revision path. CodeMirror text
collaboration is the first product consumer; the runtime contract itself is
codec-neutral.

## What remains ordinary

The Cell's materialized value remains a string for CodeMirror. Graph queries,
reactive computations, snapshots, point-in-time reads, and non-collaborative UI
consume that ordinary value. They do not read or reconstruct the operation log.

`cf-code-editor` enables this path only when its `collaborative` property is set,
its value is a string Cell handle, and the Memory server advertises
`codemirror-changeset@1`. Plain strings, non-collaborative Cell bindings, and
existing debounce behavior keep their existing whole-value write path.

## Authority and lifecycle

Memory is the only integration authority. A client submits an `apply-op` with a
versioned codec id, durable submission id, field cursor, and codec payload. The
same transaction stores the submitted projection, appends canonical integrated
operations, advances the field cursor, and writes the ordinary materialized
revision.

One collaborative epoch owns a field until it is explicitly released or its
entity is deleted. An ordinary write may change other paths, but it cannot
change an active collaborative path. Deliberate release plus replacement may be
one ordered commit. Reopening the field creates a new epoch.

The current implementation supports only the default branch. Collaborative
queries, applies, and releases on child branches fail explicitly.

## Checkpoints, reconnect, and reset

The operation cursor is `{ epoch, version }`. Memory creates storage-owned
checkpoints at a configured operation interval. When a later checkpoint is
created, integrated rows through the preceding checkpoint are pruned, while
submitted rows remain available for idempotency and audit.

A connected or reconnecting client at the retained floor receives the complete
contiguous suffix. A client behind the floor receives `reset: true` and the
current canonical materialized value. CodeMirror reinstalls from that value
when it has no pending edits. If it has unconfirmed local edits, the editor
preserves them, becomes read-only, and emits an explicit reconciliation event
containing both local and canonical values. A stale write fails with
`OpHistoryUnavailableError`; Memory never transforms it across missing history.

## Operational inspection

`deno task cf inspect operations <space> [entity-id] --json` reads the durable
store offline. It reports field addresses, epochs, cursors, retained floors,
submitted and integrated histories, checkpoints, pagination markers, and
consistency checks against the ordinary materialized value. `cf inspect` is
read-only; explicit pruning is a Memory engine maintenance operation.

OpenTelemetry instruments use the `ct.memory.operation.*` prefix for accepted
apply count, transform suffix length, submitted payload bytes, integration
duration, reset count, codec failures, and observed active-watch count.
