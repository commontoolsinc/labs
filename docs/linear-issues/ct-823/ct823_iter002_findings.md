# CT-823 Iteration 002 - Key Findings from Logs

## Key Learnings from CT-823 Test Logs

### 1. **The Bug is NOT Where We Thought**
- **Handlers work perfectly**: Even after conflicts, `[CT823-HANDLER]` logs show handlers execute and push messages successfully
- **user.get() returns valid data**: Always returns `{name: "User1"}` or `{name: "User2"}` - never undefined
- **Push operations succeed**: All 20 messages push successfully each time

### 2. **Critical Discovery: Silent Sync Failure**
- Messages stop syncing between tabs BEFORE any ConflictErrors appear
- Tab 2 silently failed to receive "tab1msg2" messages while Tab 1 continued working fine
- This suggests the WebSocket connection or subscription mechanism fails silently

### 3. **The Reload Death Spiral**
After reload, Tab 2 experienced:
- **100+ ConflictErrors**: `Transaction failed ConflictError: The application/json of of:baedreih...`
- **100+ TypeErrors**: `Unknown type undefined at Object.toTree10`
- **Complete UI breakdown**: ALL messages disappeared, showing empty chat

### 4. **The Real Problem: Reactive Binding Corruption**
The errors suggest:
- Reactive Cell references stored in arrays become corrupted after conflicts
- The UI tries to render these corrupted references, gets `undefined`, throws TypeErrors
- The rendering system (`toTree10`) can't handle the corrupted state

### 5. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
- `WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8000/...' failed: Close received after close`
- Connection failures correlate with sync breakdowns
- BroadcastChannel for cross-tab communication may be failing

### 6. **Recipe Architecture Flaw**
The recipe stores reactive Cell references (`user.get()`) in arrays. During conflict resolution:
- These reactive bindings get severed
- The UI can't render undefined/corrupted references
- The recipe becomes permanently broken until page refresh

## Timeline of Failure

1. **Initial State**: Both tabs working, syncing properly
2. **Silent Failure**: Tab 2 stops receiving new messages (no errors yet)
3. **User Reloads**: Attempting to fix sync issue
4. **Conflict Cascade**: 100+ ConflictErrors on data reconciliation
5. **Type Errors**: 100+ TypeErrors as UI tries to render corrupted data
6. **Complete Breakdown**: Recipe non-functional, empty UI

## What This Proves

### ✅ Working Components:
- Handler execution
- Cell.push() operations
- user.get() value retrieval
- Local state updates

### ❌ Broken Components:
- Cross-tab message synchronization
- WebSocket connection stability
- Reactive binding preservation through conflicts
- Error recovery mechanisms
- UI rendering of corrupted state

## Next Steps Should Focus On:

1. **Fix the sync mechanism** - Why do messages stop syncing before conflicts?
2. **Handle reactive references properly** - Preserve bindings through conflict resolution
3. **Add error recovery** - Don't let TypeErrors cascade and break the entire UI
4. **Improve WebSocket resilience** - Handle connection failures gracefully

## Critical Insight

The logs prove this isn't a simple conflict handling issue - it's a fundamental problem with how CommonTools handles reactive Cell references in arrays during multi-tab synchronization. The system breaks in three stages:

1. **Sync Failure** (silent)
2. **Conflict Generation** (on reload)
3. **UI Corruption** (permanent until refresh)

Each stage compounds the previous failure, creating an unrecoverable state.
