# Imports

A file's `import` declarations are the list of what that file depends on.
Reading the top of a file tells you what it pulls in, what the build has to
resolve, and what a reader has to know about before reading further. Two
constructs break that: a type written as `import("./mod.ts").Thing`, and a
module loaded by an `import("./mod.ts")` expression in the middle of a
function. Both are called an inline import here.

Two lint rules keep them out. They live in
[`tasks/lint-inline-imports.ts`](../../tasks/lint-inline-imports.ts) and are
registered under `lint.plugins` in the root `deno.jsonc`, so `deno lint` runs
them over the whole repository.

## `cf-imports/no-inline-type-import`

Reports every type written as `import("...")`, with no exceptions.

```ts
import type { VNode } from "commonfabric";

// Wrong: the dependency is written into the type that uses it.
interface WrongPatternOutput {
  tile: import("commonfabric").VNode;
}

// Right: the dependency is in the import list.
interface RightPatternOutput {
  tile: VNode;
}
```

Nothing is lost by moving the declaration to the top. TypeScript erases an
`import type` entirely, so it adds no runtime dependency, no load-order
effect, and no bundle weight — which is the whole of what the inline form was
buying. The inline form exists so a `.d.ts` can name a type without a
declaration of its own; ordinary source has a declaration list, and the type
belongs in it.

Two shapes are worth naming:

- A class or other value used in a type query. `import type { Thing }` still
  works: a type-only binding is legal in a `typeof` position.

  ```ts
  import type { FabricLink } from "@commonfabric/data-model/fabric-instances";

  interface Api {
    FabricLink: typeof FabricLink;
  }
  ```

- A whole module, written `typeof import("./mod.ts")`. Import the namespace
  type and take `typeof` of it.

  ```ts
  // Shown for illustration only.
  import type * as cellCache from "../src/compilation-cache/cell-cache.ts";

  type CellCacheModule = typeof cellCache;
  ```

When the local name is already taken — a test that declares its own `UI` to
stand in for an ambient one, say — import under an alias
(`import type { UI as UI_TYPE }`).

One shape has no top-of-file form: an ambient declaration file with no
imports of its own, whose `declare` statements are global precisely because
the file is not a module. Adding an import there makes it a module and the
globals stop being global. No file in this repository is in that position
today; one that ends up there takes a `deno-lint-ignore` saying so.

## `cf-imports/no-inline-module-import`

Reports an `import("...")` expression that names its module with a plain
string. A computed specifier is not reported: a module named by a template
literal, a variable, or a URL built while the program runs has no
top-of-file equivalent at all.

```ts
// Reported: the module could be imported at the top.
const { listPieces } = await import("../piece.ts");

// Not reported: no import declaration can name this.
const isolated = await import(`./benchmark.ts?scope=${crypto.randomUUID()}`);
```

Unlike the type rule, this one has real exceptions. A deferred load earns its
place when:

- **The module cannot load here.** `node:async_hooks` exists under Deno and
  Node and nowhere else; the FUSE bindings for one platform cannot load on
  another.
- **Loading it costs something the caller may not want to pay.** Importing
  `@commonfabric/runner/storage/cache.deno` opens SQLite's native library, so
  it needs `--allow-ffi` from every consumer that so much as mentions the
  module. The OpenTelemetry SDK probes its environment as it loads. A `cf`
  completion request runs between two keystrokes and should load only what
  its own candidates need.
- **The load has to happen at a chosen moment.** A test that installs browser
  globals, replaces a global, or sets an environment variable that a module
  reads as it loads has to do that first. A test that wants a module
  evaluated afresh loads it again through a query string.
- **The load is the thing under test.** A test asserting that evaluating an
  entry point does not run it as `main` has to evaluate it.

Keep the deferred load and say which of these it is:

```ts
// The Deno storage cache opens SQLite as it loads, and a caller that never
// builds a runtime should not pay for that.
// deno-lint-ignore cf-imports/no-inline-module-import
const { StorageManager } = await import("@commonfabric/runner/storage/cache.deno");
```

A Deno ignore directive applies to the line directly after it, so the
directive is always the last line of the comment block and the explanation
goes above it.

When a whole file is about loading modules at run time — the shell's view
tests, the A/B harness that loads one module graph from two checkouts — one
directive at the top carries the reason for all of its sites:

```ts
// deno-lint-ignore-file cf-imports/no-inline-module-import -- the view's module
// graph reaches @commonfabric/ui, whose components extend a bare HTMLElement as
// they load, so it can only load once the test has installed one.
```

A file-level directive covers sites added later too, so prefer the per-site
form unless the file really is uniformly about deferred loading. A file gets
only one such directive — Deno reads the first and ignores any that follow —
so a file that already carries one names both rules on that line:

```text
// deno-lint-ignore-file no-explicit-any cf-imports/no-inline-module-import --
```

## Node built-ins

A static `import ... from "node:crypto"` is rejected by Deno's
`no-external-import` rule, which the repository switches on. Reaching for a
dynamic `import("node:crypto")` to get around that trades one problem for
another. Alias the specifier in the package's own `deno.jsonc` instead, which
is what `no-external-import` means by "use import maps":

```jsonc
"imports": {
  "@node/crypto": "node:crypto"
}
```

```ts
// Shown for illustration only.
import * as nodeCrypto from "@node/crypto";
```

`packages/cli`, `packages/data-model`, and `packages/toolshed` each carry one
of these aliases. A module that genuinely cannot depend on a Node built-in —
because it also loads in a browser — is a different case, and belongs under
`cf-imports/no-inline-module-import` with its reason written down.
