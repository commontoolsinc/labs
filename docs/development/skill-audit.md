# Skill Fact Audit

A skill's map — canonical homes, exact symbols, file paths — is its
highest-value and highest-rot content (see
[`skill-authoring.md`](./skill-authoring.md), "facts rot — make them testable").
Two mechanisms keep it honest, and they are complementary, not alternatives:

- **Tripwire (deterministic floor).** `deno task check-skill-facts`
  (`tasks/check-skill-facts.ts`) — a cheap, instant, zero-token CI gate over
  every markdown file under `skills/`, which fails if an import specifier or repo
  path a skill cites stops _resolving_: a bare import of a package with no root
  export, a missing subpath, or a vanished path. Runs on every PR (the `check`
  job). Catches resolvability rot only, and deliberately hardcodes no fact list —
  every fact it checks is derived from the skill text itself, so a skill gains
  coverage by being written, not by being registered anywhere.
- **Audit (LLM ceiling).** A periodic / on-change pass that reads a skill against
  the current tree and judges the _semantic_ rot the tripwire cannot see: a
  canonical home that moved or was renamed, advice that is now wrong, a new home
  the skill should mention, framing that has drifted from how the system actually
  works. This half **appreciates** as models improve — at the limit it is the
  more useful of the two.

The auditor is **cf-review itself** — do not build a parallel reviewer. cf-review
already verifies a skill's facts against the tree (it did so unprompted when it
reviewed its own PR). The audit is just cf-review pointed at a skill.

## What the tripwire treats as a citation

Skills use backticks for far more than paths, so the tripwire only checks an
inline backticked token when it is shaped like a path and is rooted at a
directory that really exists — either at the repo root or inside the citing
skill's own directory. Both rootings are in use: `skills/cf` names
`scripts/check-local-dev.sh` at the repo root, while `skills/agent-browser` names
`scripts/form-automation.sh`, which lives in `skills/agent-browser/scripts/`.

Everything else is left alone. A token with whitespace is a command line rather
than a path. A token with no directory separator has nothing to root it. Prose
(`async/await`), flags (`-s/--space`), module specifiers
(`lit/directives/class-map.js`) and paths inside a mounted filesystem
(`input/contacts.json`) do not start with a real directory, so they are skipped.
Fenced code blocks are not scanned at all.

The rooting requirement cuts both ways: a real path written in an abbreviated
form that omits the directory rooting it is skipped as well, so it rots unseen.
Write paths from the repo root to get them checked.

Membership comes from git rather than from the filesystem, so the question is
"is this path part of the repo" rather than "does this path exist on this
machine". Ignored build output never makes a citation resolve, so the check does
not depend on whether you happen to have built, and a wrong-case citation is
caught on a case-insensitive filesystem instead of surviving until CI. A path the
index still holds but the working tree has lost does not count either, so a
citation breaks as soon as its target moves away rather than lingering until the
deletion is staged.

To cite a path as an illustration rather than a real location, write it as a
placeholder — `packages/<pkg>/mod.ts`, `cf-{name}/cf-{name}.figma.ts`,
`packages/**`. The tripwire skips those by design, and that is the intended
opt-out; there is no allowlist, and none of the skills has needed one.

## Triggers

- **On change** — when a PR touches `skills/**`, give it a cf-review pass. (A
  norm today; can become a CI job that runs cf-review on the skill diff once
  agent-in-CI infra is settled.)
- **Periodic** — on a schedule (e.g. monthly), run the prompt below over each
  `skills/**/SKILL.md` and open an issue or fix-PR per drift found. Wire it
  through the repo's scheduled-agent / routine capability.

## Audit prompt

> Read `<skill>/SKILL.md` and audit every load-bearing fact against the current
> tree. For each canonical home, symbol, path, package export, and behavioral
> claim it asserts: is it still true? Has a home moved, been renamed, or been
> removed? Is any "do not" advice stale? Is there a _new_ canonical home or
> footgun the skill should name but doesn't? Does the framing still match how the
> system actually works, and is it still coherent with
> `docs/development/skill-authoring.md`? Verify against the tree (read the code /
> exports) — don't speculate. Report drift as: location · the claim · what is
> actually true now · the one-line fix. If everything resolves, say so and stop.

## Why this isn't all in the tripwire

Deterministic extraction of "is this fact still _true_" from prose is brittle, so
the tripwire asks only the narrow question it can answer exactly: does this name
still resolve? The rot that matters most is invisible to it. The worst case — the
home moved, but both the old and the new name still exist — resolves perfectly
well and is still wrong. So is advice that has quietly become bad, and so is a
new canonical home or footgun the skill should name but doesn't. The tripwire
stays narrow on purpose; the audit carries the judgment.

One row it cannot cover by construction: the cf-review anti-dup table's
cell↔link entry names a **bare internal symbol** (`convertCellsToLinks` in
`packages/runner/src/cell.ts`) — an internal runner function with no package
export, so there's nothing for the resolvability check to resolve. That symbol's
accuracy is the audit's job, not the tripwire's. (Noted from @mpsalisbury's
review of #3829.)
