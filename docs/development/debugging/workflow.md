# Debugging Workflow

## 5-Step Debugging Process

### 1. Check TypeScript Errors

```bash
deno task cf check pattern.tsx --no-run
```

Fix all type errors before deploying. Most issues are caught here.

### 2. Match Error to Doc

- **Type errors** - [@writeable](../../common/concepts/types-and-schemas/writable.md)
- **Reactivity issues** - [@reactivity](../../common/concepts/reactivity.md)
- **Component questions** - [@COMPONENTS](../../common/components/COMPONENTS.md)
- **Pattern examples** - [@index](../../../packages/patterns/index.md)

### 3. Inspect Cell Values

Use `<cf-cell-context>` for on-demand value inspection:

```tsx
<cf-cell-context $cell={result} label="Result">
  <div>{result.value}</div>
</cf-cell-context>
```

Hold **Alt** and hover to access debugging toolbar (val, id, watch/unwatch).

### 4. Inspect Deployed Piece

```bash
deno task cf piece inspect --identity key.json --api-url URL --space SPACE --piece ID
```

### 5. Simplify Until It Works

1. Comment out code until you have a minimal working pattern
2. Add back features one at a time
3. Test after each addition

## Quick Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Can't call `.set()` | Add `Writable<T>` to type signature |
| Filter not updating | Use `computed(() => items.filter(...))` |
| Checkbox not syncing | Use `$checked` not `checked` |
| Style not applying | Check element type (object vs string syntax) |
| LLM in handler | Move `generateText` to pattern body |
| UI blocking | Use `fetchData` instead of `await` in handlers |

## 6. Check Runtime Logs and Stats

The runtime has structured loggers across all modules (`runner`, `runtime-client`,
etc.). Most are disabled by default to keep the console clean. Enabling them
produces tagged output in the browser console, which is useful for tracing what
the runtime is doing under the hood.

```javascript
// Enable a logger and set it to debug level — this produces console output
commonfabric.logger["runner"].disabled = false
commonfabric.logger["runner"].level = "debug"

// Turn it back off when done to reduce noise
commonfabric.logger["runner"].disabled = true
```

Even when loggers are disabled, call counts and timing stats are still tracked.
You can inspect these without turning on console output:

```javascript
// See which loggers exist and their call counts
commonfabric.getLoggerCountsBreakdown()

// Check timing stats (IPC latency, cell operations, etc.)
commonfabric.getTimingStatsBreakdown()

// Check for actions with invalid inputs (schema mismatches)
commonfabric.getLoggerFlagsBreakdown()
```

See [console-commands](./console-commands.md) for the full reference.
