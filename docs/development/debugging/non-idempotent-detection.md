# Detecting Non-Idempotent Computations

Patterns define reactive computations (`computed`, `lift`) that must
be **idempotent**: given the same inputs, they must produce the same outputs.
When they don't, the scheduler re-runs them repeatedly because each run produces
new writes that trigger further runs. This manifests as the UI churning, high
CPU usage, and the system never reaching a stable state.

Common causes:

- A `computed()` that calls `.set()` on a `Writable<>` with a value derived
  from a non-deterministic source such as `crypto.randomUUID()` (the ambient
  clock and entropy — `Date.now()`, `Math.random()` — no longer reach this
  failure mode: they throw a `TimeCapabilityError` inside a `computed()`/`lift()`
  rather than churning)
- Converting a `Set` to an array where iteration order varies between runs
- Appending to an array on each execution instead of replacing it
- Two actions forming a cycle: A writes cell X which triggers B, B writes
  cell Y which triggers A
- A mapped render body that invokes a stream or writes to state immediately,
  such as `onClick={stream.send(index)}` inside `.map(...)`, instead of passing
  a handler to run when the event fires. This often appears as
  `non-idempotent raw:map` or
  `Reactive graph did not settle ... Actions: raw:map`; see
  [Immediate Event Invocation](gotchas/immediate-event-invocation.md).

Scheduler-v2 reports a bounded non-convergence episode as a warning instead of
throwing an action error. The warning names the deferred actions and the
scheduler continues retrying them behind an escalating backoff, so use the
diagnosis below to distinguish a true cycle from a slow convergence wave.

`cf check` compiles the pattern and evaluates its factory graph, but it does
not instantiate a piece or drive the runtime scheduler to idle. Scheduler
non-convergence therefore appears only when the piece actually runs (or in a
`cf test` that instantiates it), not during a compile-only `cf check`.

## Quick Start (Browser Console)

The fastest way to check for non-idempotent actions:

```javascript
// Shown inside a pattern body.
// Run diagnosis for 5 seconds (default)
await commonfabric.detectNonIdempotent()

// Run for a custom duration
await commonfabric.detectNonIdempotent(10000) // 10 seconds
```

This prints a table of non-idempotent actions and any cycles found, then returns
the full result object.

The result also includes a timed diagnosis window:

- `duration`: total wall-clock length of the window
- `busyTime`: how much of that window the scheduler spent executing work

If `busyTime / duration` is high but `nonIdempotent` and `cycles` are empty,
you are likely looking at broad fan-out or slow convergence rather than a true
non-idempotent loop.

How to interpret the output: an action is reported **non-idempotent** when its
reads were identical across runs but its writes differed — `differingWriteKeys`
names the offending cell paths, and `runs` holds the actual read/write values.
A **cycle** means two or more actions trigger each other in a loop (A writes a
cell that triggers B, B writes a cell that triggers A); even individually
idempotent actions can never settle inside a cycle.

### 4. Inline Recheck (`cf test`)

`cf test` enables an inline mode (`runtime.enableIdempotencyCheck()`): every
computation run is immediately followed by a second synchronous run against
post-commit state, and differing writes fail the test at the end
(`✗ N non-idempotent computation(s)`, listing each action and its differing
write keys). A test pattern can opt out by returning
`expectNonIdempotent: true` — note this *tolerates* violations, it does not
assert one is found.

Because the second run executes against the latest state, a concurrent write
landing between the first run and the recheck (another transaction's
commit/rollback, or a cross-runtime sync apply in multi-user tests) would make
a pure computation look non-idempotent. The recheck guards against this: when
writes differ, it compares both runs' read invariants and skips the report if
an input the action did not itself write moved between the runs. Self-caused
input moves (reading what it writes — the accumulator anti-pattern) and
equal-input nondeterminism (timestamps, random ordering) are still reported.

## Using the Console API

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Shown inside a pattern body.
// Default: 5-second diagnosis window
const result = await commonfabric.detectNonIdempotent()
```

Output looks like:

```
┌─────────┬──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
│ (index) │ action               │ differingWrites           │
├─────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ 0       │ "action:myPattern:3" │ "space/entity/items"      │
└─────────┴──────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
Cycles: []
```

### Result Shape

The returned object has the complete diagnosis:

```typescript
interface SchedulerDiagnosisResult {
  nonIdempotent: NonIdempotentReport[];
  cycles: CycleReport[];
  duration: number;   // total wall-clock time of diagnosis window (ms)
  busyTime: number;   // time scheduler spent executing actions (ms)
}

interface NonIdempotentReport {
  actionId: string;
  actionInfo?: { patternName?: string; moduleName?: string };
  runs: {
    timestamp: number;
    reads: Record<string, unknown>;   // cell path -> value
    writes: Record<string, unknown>;  // cell path -> value
  }[];
  differingWriteKeys: string[];       // which write paths differed
}

interface CycleReport {
  cycle: { actionId: string; writesCell: string }[];
  timestamp: number;
}
```

A cycle chain reads as `A --[cell X]--> B --[cell Y]--> A`: each entry's
`writesCell` is the cell that triggered the next action in the loop.

## Other Entry Points

- **Debugger UI**: open the debugger panel (bug icon in the shell header), go
  to the **Diagnosis** tab, select a duration, click **Run Diagnosis**. Shows
  the same non-idempotent actions (expandable to read/write values per run)
  and causal cycle chains.
- **RuntimeClient** (tests or tooling):

```typescript
// Shown at module scope.
import { RuntimeClient } from "@commonfabric/runtime-client";

const result = await runtimeClient.detectNonIdempotent(5000);
if (result.nonIdempotent.length > 0) {
  console.warn("Non-idempotent actions detected:", result.nonIdempotent);
}
```

An empty result with a high `busyTime` means the system is doing significant
work that is *not* explained by non-idempotent actions or cycles — switch to
the fan-out workflow in [Debugging Settle Waves](./settle-wave-investigation.md).

## Common Patterns That Cause Non-Idempotency

### Set-to-Array Ordering

```typescript
// Shown as alternative snippets.
// BAD: Set iteration order can vary between identical inputs
const uniqueTags = computed(() => {
  const set = new Set(items.map(i => i.tag));
  tags.set([...set]); // order may differ each run
});

// GOOD: Sort after converting
const uniqueTags = computed(() => {
  const set = new Set(items.map(i => i.tag));
  tags.set([...set].sort());
});
```

### Timestamps or Random Values in computed()

```typescript
// Shown inside a pattern body.
// BAD: Date.now() in a computed() throws a TimeCapabilityError (rather than
// churning) — the ambient clock is denied to reactive contexts
const enriched = computed(() => {
  return items.map(i => ({ ...i, updatedAt: Date.now() }));
});

// GOOD: read the clock only in handlers (allowed there, coarsened to one
// second), or read the reactive #now wish for a value that updates on its own
const updateItem = handler<{}, { item: Item }>((_, { item }) => {
  item.updatedAt.set(Date.now());
});
```

### Appending Instead of Replacing

```typescript
// Shown inside a pattern body.
// BAD: Grows on every re-run
const log = computed(() => {
  entries.set([...entries.get(), newEntry]);
});

// GOOD: Derive the full value, don't append
const allEntries = computed(() => {
  return [...baseEntries, derivedEntry];
});
```

### Writing to a Writable Inside computed()

```typescript
// Shown as alternative snippets.
// BAD: Side-effecting computed — if the write triggers re-reads, it cycles
const derived = computed(() => {
  const value = expensiveCalculation(input);
  output.set(value); // triggers subscribers, which may re-trigger this
  return value;
});

// GOOD: Return the value; let the system propagate it
const derived = computed(() => {
  return expensiveCalculation(input);
});
```

## For AI Agents

When debugging a pattern that appears to be churning or causing high CPU:

1. Start local dev servers (`deno task dev-local` from repo root)
2. Open the browser console
3. Run `await commonfabric.detectNonIdempotent(5000)`
4. Check `result.nonIdempotent` — the `differingWriteKeys` tell you which cell
   paths are producing different values on re-runs
5. Check `result.cycles` — if present, two or more actions are triggering each
   other in a loop
6. Look at the `runs` array on each report to compare the actual read/write
   values and understand *why* the output differs
7. Fix the pattern: sort non-deterministic collections, avoid timestamps in
   `computed()`, don't `.set()` into a `Writable<>` from inside `computed()`
   unless the value is guaranteed stable
