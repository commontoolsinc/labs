# Shuttle — runtime integration

Satellite of [`README.md`](README.md), grounding decision 9 (one
in-process connection, `cf` verbs through shared library seams, a `!cf`
subprocess escape). This records what the runtime and `packages/cli` offer
today, the discipline a long-lived process must add, and the seam work in
`cli` that is prerequisite to building anything.

## The connection

One persistent `PiecesController` serves a place. `PiecesController.initialize`
(`packages/piece/src/ops/pieces-controller.ts`) is the lean constructor: it
opens the session and its storage manager, builds the `remoteClient` runtime
over the deployment's experimental options, health-checks the server before
reading any of the space, and settles the space session. `loadPieces`
(`packages/cli/lib/piece.ts`) wraps that same sequence for the CLI, adding a
version check against the server's git sha, embedded-space validation, and the
error-log, navigate, and JSON-console wiring a one-shot verb wants. A shell
pays the sequence once at connect; `cf` pays it per invocation.

The ambient record maps onto the config shapes those functions already
take: `SpaceConfig` (`apiUrl`, `space`, `identity`, …) and `PieceConfig`
(adding `piece`, `pieceScope`, `piecePath`, `pieceInput`) in
`packages/cli/lib/piece.ts`. `cf` builds them from flags through
`parseSpaceOptions`, `parsePieceOptions`, and `readTargetPositionals`
(`packages/cli/commands/piece.ts`); shuttle constructs them from the
ambient record directly and skips the flag parsing.

The connection pushes. The `remoteClient` runtime preset opens a persistent
`WebSocketTransport` (`packages/runner/src/storage/v2-remote-session.ts`), so
a write landing on the server from anywhere reaches this process's cells and
re-fires their sinks. `watch` needs no polling.

Two existing long-lived holders show the lifecycle discipline:

- `packages/cf-harness`: `createHarnessFabricSessionFactory` builds one
  controller and `cacheHarnessFabricSessionFactory` memoizes it so every
  invocation of a run shares it. Its cache clears on a **rejected
  construction** and nothing else — the `session === attempt` test guards
  against evicting a newer attempt, and is not a health probe — so it
  covers the connection that never opened, not one that later drops.
- `packages/fuse`: `CellBridge` takes an injectable `PiecesLoader` plus a
  separate `reconnectPiecesLoader` for recovery.

`initialize` health-checks the server before it returns, so the first
connection is proven live on the way up. What a long-lived process gives up is
the repetition: `loadPieces` re-proves liveness on every verb, and a shell
asks once.

## Recovery already exists

An established connection heals below shuttle, in the memory client
(`packages/memory/v2/client.ts`) rather than the storage layer above it:

- `Client.#onClose` marks the client disconnected, calls
  `handleDisconnect()` on every `SpaceSession`, rejects in-flight requests
  as `ConnectionError`, and starts `Client.#reconnect()` — a
  single-flighted loop that re-runs `#hello()` and then `restore()`s each
  session, backing off through `reconnectDelayMs` (25 ms base, 30 s cap,
  jittered).
- Standing watches survive it. `SpaceSession` remembers its selectors in
  `#watchSpecs`; `restore()` applies the server's `sync` when the server
  resumed the session and re-arms through `watchSetSync(#watchSpecs, …)`
  when it did not. Both paths reuse the same `WatchView` instance, which is
  what keeps `SpaceReplica.#consumeWatchView`'s standing loop delivering.
  Outstanding commits replay through `#outstandingCommits`.
- `SpaceReplica` deliberately does nothing on a drop, and says so:
  `#consumeOwedSessionRemount` records that a transport drop is already
  healed by the client's own `reconnect()`/`restore()` and must be left
  alone.

One near-miss worth pinning: `Provider.#syncRequests` and `#replaySync`
(`packages/runner/src/storage/v2.ts`) look like this replay but fire only
on route replacement — the reconnect replay is `SpaceSession`'s, above.

Two gaps around it. **Initial** construction is not retried —
`SpaceReplica.#memoizedSessionHandle()` clears its memo on failure and re-attempts
only when a caller next asks for a session, which is the case cf-harness's
cache exists for. And a **permanent** failure stops the loop rather than
retrying: `isPermanentConnectionFailure` (a protocol-flag mismatch) sets
`Client.#fatalError`, while `isPermanentAuthorizationError` routes a
non-retriable denial to `#terminateSession` for that one space, leaving the
client's other spaces alive.

Shuttle therefore adds no recovery of its own. The repo's rule against retry
loops applies with particular force here: the loop that belongs in this
system already exists one layer down, and a second one would fight it.

## Observing connection state

What shuttle does need is unavailable today. The prompt's live marker and
the views' reconnecting marker both want connection state, and nothing in
the storage layer reports it:

- `Client.isConnected()` exists but reaches no consumer — `SpaceReplica`
  holds the client in a private field and surfaces nothing from it.
- The notification channel carries no connection variant.
  `IStorageNotificationCapability.subscribe` delivers commit, revert, load,
  pull, integrate, and reset notifications only.
- `IStorageManager.authorizationError(space)` is the one connection-adjacent
  state a consumer can read, and it is a per-space poll for permanent
  denial. Its own documentation records a hole: a denial that arrives during
  reconnect is visible only as the session's `closeError`.
- The memory client reports its own connection state.
  `Client.connectionState` names which state it is in, and
  `Client.whenStateChanged()` resolves the next time the client settles it,
  so a consumer of the client waits rather than polling. That surface
  stops where `isConnected()` does: the storage layer reads neither member,
  so a consumer above it still cannot tell quiet because nothing changed
  from quiet because the socket is down and backoff has reached its
  thirty-second cap.

So the liveness work is a **relay**: carrying the state the memory client
already reports up through the storage layer to a consumer, as live,
reconnecting, and permanently failed. That is what B1 owes, and those three
are what the prompt and the view markers render. The client's own vocabulary
is wider — it separates a closed client from a failed one — so the relay
decides what to collapse.

## Watch mechanics

`Cell.sink(callback, options)` (`IAnyCell.sink`,
`packages/runner/src/cell.ts`) is the substrate: it fires immediately with
the current value and re-fires on every committed change, and it works
outside a browser — `packages/fuse/cell-bridge.ts`,
`packages/cli/lib/callable.ts`, and the agents connector all sink from Deno
processes. (`packages/runtime-client` is not a candidate: its only transport
is browser-main-thread-to-Web-Worker.)

Two disciplines every existing sink consumer rediscovered:

- **Settling.** One logical change fires several sink callbacks before the
  reactive graph quiets. FUSE debounces on a timer; `renderVDomToHtml`
  (`packages/cli/lib/piece-render.ts`) uses a reentrancy guard plus
  `runtime.idle()` so several batches produce exactly one report per quiet
  runtime. The guard-plus-`idle()` form is the one to adopt — no timer.
- **Freshness requires running.** A piece that is not started serves stored
  state; computed values are only fresh when the pattern runs in this
  process. That is what `cf cell get --step` does per invocation
  (`getCellValue` in `packages/cli/lib/piece.ts`: get with `runIt`, then
  pull, `idle`, `synced`). In a persistent shell that dance collapses to a
  one-time start per piece. When shuttle starts a piece is a policy question
  the main document carries.

`renderPiece(config, { watch, onUpdate })` in
`packages/cli/lib/piece-render.ts` is the closest prior art: it returns a
cancel function and drives `onUpdate` per settled change. Its command action
keeps the process alive with a SIGINT listener and a never-resolving promise
— the shape a shell must not copy.

## Seam inventory in `packages/cli`

The CLI already factors many command actions as named exports with
dependency seams — the `*FromCommand` family in
`packages/cli/commands/piece.ts` (`getCellValueFromCommand`,
`setCellValueFromCommand`, `listPiecesFromCommand`,
`describePieceFromCommand`, the survey/repair/retarget/rollback/restore set,
and more), each shaped `(options, ...positionals, deps)`. `cf wish` goes
further: `wishAction` over `readWish` (`packages/cli/lib/wish.ts`), which
abstracts its connection behind `WishRuntimeHost` — the cleanest seam and
the model to generalize.

Connection injection is uneven. `PieceResolutionDeps.loadPieces` is the
injection point that lets a lib function reuse a held controller:

- **Accept it:** `getCellValue`, `listPieces`, `listSpaceSlugs`,
  `searchPieces`, `inspectPiece`, `executePieceCallable` (via
  `PieceCallableDependencies`), `readWish`, `runExec`, all of
  `lib/bulk.ts` — and the write path: `stepPiece`, `setCellValue`,
  `removePiece`, `linkPieces`, `renderPiece`, `callPieceHandler`,
  `getPieceView`, and the `lib/acl.ts` loaders. `stepPiece` gained the seam
  with its write receipt (#6556), and its unit test is the template the
  rest of the list follows. A supplied connection is the caller's to close,
  so `withAcl` disposes only a runtime it opened itself.
- **Hardcode `loadPieces`:** `setPieceSlug`, `savePiecePattern`,
  `applyPieceInput`, `linkSqliteDiskSource`, `resetHomePattern`, and
  `commands/deps.ts`. Each opens a fresh runtime and WebSocket per call. No
  shuttle-v1 verb reaches one, so each is a conversion for the milestone
  that first calls it.

`call` has the family's shape too, in `callFromCommand`
(`commands/piece.ts`). Cliffy splits an invocation into the two arrays it
holds on the command object bound as an action's `this` — this command's
own arguments, the line past `cf piece call` (`getRawArgs`), which a
grammar
refusal reprints after prepending that prefix itself, and the words past
`--` (`getLiteralArgs`), which the read step parses — so both are
parameters of the named export, beside the mount's spelling, and the action
is the two reads that hand them on. The constituents underneath are
exported and library-grade (`executePieceCallable`, `pieceCallRawArgs`,
`pieceCallInvocation`, `resolveInvocationIdentity`,
`pieceCallPhaseObserver`, `resolveWaitControl`, `parsePieceCallSelection`,
`boundedSettlement`, `renderPieceCallOutcome`). Its deps bag holds
collaborators only — the `render`/`hint` sinks and the dispatch itself —
so a caller holding a connection passes an `executePieceCallable` bound to
it rather than opening one per call.

Not every v1 verb lands on a `*FromCommand` action, and which ones do not
is what decides whether a bare `Deno.exit` in some Cliffy action is
shuttle's problem. One does: **`call` goes through `callFromCommand`**.
`wish` goes through `readWish`, which takes a `WishReadConfig` — a
`SpaceConfig` with the query beside it — accepts `deps.loadPieces`, and
returns the resolution as a value. The rest are composed from the library:

- **`link` calls `linkPieces` (`lib/piece.ts`) directly**, which is the seam
  A2 gave it and which raises `LinkValidationError` as a value, so the
  inline action behind `cf piece link` — exit and all — is not on shuttle's
  path.
- **`verbs` composes `listPieceCallables` (`lib/piece.ts`) with the exported
  `verbListingLines` / `verbListingJson` / `verbListingNotes` and
  `partitionVerbListing`**, rendering the rows itself rather than running that
  command's inline action.
- **`ls` composes `listSpaceSlugs` and `listPieces` (`lib/piece.ts`) with
  `listCellKeys` (`lib/cell-listing.ts`)**, handing each the held connection as
  `deps.loadPieces`.
- **`get` calls `getCellValue` and `set` calls `setCellValue`**
  (`lib/piece.ts`), each over a `PieceConfig` built from the place and each
  handed the connection as `deps.loadPieces`. A read that fails on a data
  condition is `pieceGetDataErrorReport` beside `exitWithDataError`, both
  exported, so a caller composing the read keeps the report `cf cell get`
  prints.
- **`describe` composes `describePiece` (`lib/piece.ts`) with the exported
  `pieceDescribeLines` and `pieceDescribeJson`**, choosing the page shape
  itself.

What rules the wrappers out is one fact repeated across five of them, and it
is not that any refuses a connection or a sink. Each takes its read, its
dispatch and its outputs as injectable deps, so a caller can bind every one
of those to a connection it holds and to a screen it draws. It is what is
left after that. Each parses a Cliffy options object into the config it then
hands on — `listSlugsFromCommand` and `listPiecesFromCommand` through
`parseSpaceOptions` and a `--json` flag, `describePieceFromCommand` through
`parsePieceOptions`, `getCellValueFromCommand` and `setCellValueFromCommand`
through `readTargetPositionals`, `parsePieceOptions` and `mergePiecePath`
— and shuttle holds a place rather than a `--cell` string: a piece, a path
already in segments, and a scope. Reaching any of those wrappers would mean
rendering the place to an address, hanging it on an options object nobody
typed, and letting the intake parse it back, the path through `parseCellPath`
included. Each also calls its own default read with no `deps` argument, so
threading a connection means substituting that read, which leaves the intake
as the whole of what the wrapper still contributes. Two further facts hold of
the cell pair and of `describePieceFromCommand`: each writes the process's
hint posture on the way in (`setQuietMode`, which the connection limit in
item 6 covers rather than forbids), and `getCellValueFromCommand` returns
nothing — the value it read reaches `deps.render` and no caller, where
shuttle renders the value itself.

`callFromCommand` is the one that survives that test, because what it
contributes is not intake. The step-10 read section, the invocation identity
and the wait control, the phase observer, the settlement bound, the outcome
rendering, and the three exits A4 threaded are all its own, and its two argv
arrays are ordinary parameters rather than something read off a bound
command. Its `deps` bag holds collaborators only, so a caller holding a
connection passes an `executePieceCallable` bound to it and drives the rest
as written.

## Prerequisite work in `packages/cli`

Each of these is small and lands on its own; together they are what decision
9's "factor the seam in `cli`, not reimplement in shuttle" means concretely.

1. **Export entries.** Done. `@commonfabric/cli` carries an entry for each
   lib module a sibling calls, beside `.` → `mod.ts`, whose import runs CLI
   startup.
2. **Thread `deps.loadPieces` through the functions that still hardcode
   it.** Everything a shuttle-v1 verb reaches takes it; what is left is the
   set the inventory above names, each converting for the milestone that
   first calls it.
3. **`callFromCommand`.** Done. `buildCallCommand`'s action reads the two
   argv arrays off the command bound to it and hands them on; everything
   below that line is the named export, which needs no binding.
4. **Exit discipline.** Done. `exitWithDataError` and `exitPieceCallFailure`
   default to `Deno.exit(1)` (typed `never`) and take a `deps` override in
   its place, which the seams that report through one forward:
   `getCellValueFromCommand` on a data error, and `callFromCommand` at each
   of its three exits. `callFromCommand` is the one of those two a v1 verb
   lands on; a `get` composed from `getCellValue` reaches `exitWithDataError`
   only where it builds the report itself, and the override is what lets it
   do that without ending the process. Shuttle's shim therefore throws
   rather than returns — what an `exit` typed `never` requires — and shuttle
   catches it beside the `ValidationError` that `exitPieceCallFailure`
   rethrows for Cliffy's usage rendering. `callFromCommand` reports its
   payload rejection from inside the dispatch's promise chain, so it records
   that an exit ran and rethrows rather than describing the shim's own throw
   as a second failure.
5. **Output capture.** What a caller captures is the seam's own output:
   for every seam a v1 verb reaches, the value or page goes to `render`,
   the next steps to `hint`, a failure's report to `printError`, and the
   lines a call publishes while it is in flight — the invocation pair as
   the dispatch happens, and the spans under `--verbose` — to `announce`.
   What the seam prints, the caller decides where.

   `announce` is one sink rather than several because its three streams —
   the pair, the spans, and the per-phase lines
   `CF_TEST_ANNOUNCE_INVOCATION_PHASES` adds — interleave in one temporal
   stream, and splitting them would leave a caller rendering them as
   ordered events reassembling an order it was handed already sorted. It
   is separate from `printError` because all three are published whether
   or not the call goes on to fail. Raw stderr, which a caller supplying
   nothing still gets, suits a command that owns the terminal for one
   invocation; a caller drawing its own screen is corrupted by a line
   written behind the frame, so the views the pager substrate carries
   need these as events they can place.

   Two kinds of writing still reach the process, and they are different
   problems. The first is a **designed output with no sink**: the write
   receipt, `noteWroteTo` (`lib/write-receipt.ts`), which `set`, `link`
   and `call` all reach. It wants a sink of its own rather than the hint
   stream, because `--quiet` deliberately does not silence it, and a memo
   per connection rather than per process — its `receipted` set, which
   item 6 names among the state one process's callers share.

   The second is **lib-internal warnings no seam reaches**, all in
   `lib/piece.ts`, and the sweep is of every `console.*` there rather
   than the error ones alone:

   - `loadPieceForCallables` warns on `console.warn` when it cannot
     ensure the default pattern. `call` reaches it through
     `resolvePieceCallable`, `verbs` through `listPieceCallables`, and
     `describe` through `describePiece` — three v1 verbs, and the last of
     them a seam that takes `render`/`hint` and cannot route this.
   - `withRuntimeCleanupOnFailure` warns twice on `console.warn` when
     disposal itself fails after a failed connect, and `loadPieces` wraps
     its whole body in it, so any v1 verb can reach both.
   - The navigate callback inside `loadPieces` writes three lines, and
     one of them goes to **`console.log` — raw stdout** — whenever
     `jsonOutput` is false, which is every `cf piece call` without `--json`.
     Behind a full-screen frame that corrupts the drawing, and it lands
     in the machine surface besides. It is the one on this list to fix
     first.

   The rest of that file is off a v1 verb's path: the pin-rewrite report
   belongs to `piece new` and to `setsrc` either side of `--check`, the
   `savePiecePattern` warning to `setsrc`, the `searchPieces` warning to
   a `search` verb v1 defers, and the inspect warning to `piece map`. The
   phase trace wraps operations throughout the module, `linkPieces` among
   them, but writes nothing unless `CF_CLI_TRACE_TIMINGS=1` asks it to.

   Sweep each as views need it captured.
6. **Module-global state.** Done, as the recorded limit rather than as
   scoping: **shuttle v1 holds one connection per process**, revisited
   when multiple places arrive ([`futures.md`](futures.md) candidate 3).
   Three kinds of state are the process's rather than a connection's, and
   the first kind is what a connection writes for itself — the endpoint
   `setLLMUrl` holds, written by `loadPieces` and by
   `PiecesController.initialize` in another package; the base URL
   `getPatternEnvironment()` hands a pattern's relative `fetch`, which the
   `remoteClient` preset pins from `apiUrl`; and the ambient experimental
   flags a `Runtime` applies as it is built (`modernCellRep`,
   `contentAddressedSchemas`, `readerSchemaPrecedence`), which for a CLI
   connection come from the deployment itself. The second is the posture a
   caller sets: `quietMode`, which each `FromCommand` entry writes and
   which therefore stands as the last caller left it. The third is a memo
   of work already done: `receipted` (`lib/write-receipt.ts`), so a shell
   holding a connection names a space once and stays silent for every
   write after, and the version-skew note `deferSkewNoteUntilFailureExit`
   holds for a failure exit, which is one note about one server and prints
   at process end.

   What a check can reach is narrower than the limit, and the two are not
   the same claim. `claimProcessDeployment` (`lib/process-deployment.ts`)
   refuses a connection to a second *deployment*: `loadPieces` claims the
   one it opens against, and a connection to a different one throws
   naming both rather than rewriting the first's settings. That is the
   bound where those settings actually fight, and it is weaker than the
   limit in two directions. A second connection to the *same* deployment
   passes — it writes the same settings, and it is what a verb reaching an
   un-injected library function already does — so the posture and the two
   memos rest on the limit alone. And a connection opened through
   `PiecesController.initialize` directly, as `packages/fuse` and
   `packages/cf-harness` open one, passes no claim at all.

   Three declarations name it, all of them in `packages/cli`: `quietMode`
   and `receipted` say what holds of them under it, and `loadPieces` says
   what it refuses and where the reasoning is kept. The globals in
   `packages/llm` and `packages/runner` belong to other packages and say
   nothing about it, so this inventory is the only record of them — and
   the part of it that goes stale first if nobody reads it back against
   those files. What `packages/cli/README.md` records is the deployment
   rule, on `cf`'s own terms: one connection per process is false of `cf`,
   where a single verb opens several, so the connection limit is recorded
   here, and a shuttle process is what holds to it.
7. **Disposal.** `withRuntimeCleanupOnFailure` disposes only on throw; the
   success path relies on process exit. In a long-lived shell every
   un-injected call leaks a runtime, a storage manager, and a WebSocket —
   injection is correctness, not merely speed. `groupSessions` in
   `lib/bulk.ts` (open, `synced`, `dispose` per group) names the cost.
8. **Invocation session.** `newSessionId`'s contract is one per agent run,
   shared by every call of the run. A shuttle instance is a run: mint one at
   startup and pass it explicitly into every `call` (decision 6 forbids
   env-var mutation; `resolveInvocationIdentity` throws on `--invocation`
   without a session). Replay via `--invocation` then works within a
   shuttle session for free.
