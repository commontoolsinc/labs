# Agent requests — implementation plan

Sequences the build of
[Agent requests from a pattern, and the queue that runs them](agent-requests-and-work-queue.md).
Read that document for the reasoning; this one names the files, the tests,
and the order. Each stage is one pull request or a small stack, lands green
on its own, and is testable without a model provider. Checkboxes are ticked
as work lands; when the last stage of the first take (stage 6) lands, both
documents are archived to `docs/history/plans/`.

**Status:** not started. Written 2026-09-18 against `37b1acd3dd`.

## Ground rules for every stage

- Read `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT.md` and
  `docs/development/code-comment-style.md` before the first edit; new tests
  follow `docs/development/unit-test-coding-style.md` and wait on events per
  `docs/development/waiting-in-tests.md`.
- Red before green: the stage's acceptance tests are written first and shown
  failing.
- Before pushing: `deno fmt --check`, `deno lint`, `deno task check`,
  `deno task test` in every touched package, and the repo-wide gates a stage
  names below. Merge `origin/main` before testing and pushing.
- Every stage updates the live documents it changes in the same change; the
  list at the end of the design document is the checklist.
- No new provider, no new sandbox technology, no Loom write path.

## Stage 1 — Loom retrieval tools in the harness

**Package:** `packages/cf-harness`. **Depends on:** nothing.

The retrieval tools mirror the three authoring tools end to end: a host-side
configuration the model cannot see, a command transport it cannot change,
structured stdin, typed outputs, and admission through the tool-descriptor
availability tables.

- [ ] `src/loom-retrieval.ts` — sibling of `src/loom-authoring.ts`:
      `HarnessLoomRetrievalConfig { cliPath, transport, readCeilingFile?, facets? }`
      reusing `HarnessLoomAuthoringTransport`; `LoomRetrievalCommand` union
      (`search`, `page.discover`, `page.inspect`, `page.read`, `people`,
      `calendar.list`, `context`, `profile`); a `runLoomRetrievalCommand`
      that builds argv from a typed input, always passes `--json` where the
      command takes it and `--concise` where `page` takes it, runs through
      `createClearedHostProcessEnv`, and parses stdout as JSON with a
      `schemaVersion` check for `search`.
- [ ] Confirm each of `people`, `calendar list`, `context`, `profile` against
      the pinned loom checkout (`~/looms/primary/src/bin/loom`): read-only,
      JSON output, argument list. Drop from the union any that is not; record
      the dropped ones and why in `packages/cf-harness/docs/LOOM_RETRIEVAL.md`.
- [ ] `src/tools/loom-retrieval.ts` — one `HarnessToolDefinition` per tool
      (`loom_search`, `loom_page_discover`, `loom_page_inspect`,
      `loom_page_read`, `loom_people`, `loom_calendar_list`, `loom_context`,
      `loom_profile`), each `effectClass: "read"`, each returning a bounded
      output with the untrusted-content notice the prompt loop attaches to
      `web_fetch` results (`src/prompt-loop.ts`, the search notice), and each
      recording the rows' `ifc` labels as observations through the existing
      `HarnessCfcModelContext` accumulation.
- [ ] Label measurement: before a row enters model context, its label is
      measured against the run's observation ceiling with the same predicate
      `run_pattern` uses (`describeSinkReleaseRefusal` where a transaction is
      available, `atomsOutsideCeiling` over the disclosed label otherwise); a
      row above the ceiling is replaced by a typed opaque entry; a row with no
      readable label is reported as `CFC_LABEL_READ_FAILED_ATOM`, never as
      public.
- [ ] Ceiling forwarding: the run's ceiling is written to a host temp file and
      passed as `--read-ceiling-file`; facets from the config ride the
      transport the way the authoring transport carries `actor`.
- [ ] `src/contracts/tool-descriptor.ts` — the eight ids in `BuiltinToolId`;
      `LOOM_RETRIEVAL_TOOL_IDS`; an `loomRetrievalAvailable` availability flag
      beside `loomAuthoringAvailable` in both the withheld and the offered
      lists.
- [ ] `src/engine.ts` — input and output map entries; `src/tools/registry.ts`
      — registration; `src/config.ts` and `src/session-assembly.ts` —
      `loomRetrieval?: HarnessLoomRetrievalConfig`, validated like
      `loomAuthoring`; `src/cli.ts` — `--loom-retrieval-config` and
      `CF_HARNESS_LOOM_RETRIEVAL_CONFIG`; `--describe-capabilities` lists the
      tools.
- [ ] Loom side (separate change in `~/looms/primary`): `schemaVersion: 1` on
      the `search --json` payload at `src/lib/connectors/search.py`, per the
      comment there.
- [ ] Tests, `test/loom-retrieval.test.ts` and `test/tools/loom-retrieval.test.ts`,
      with a fake `ProcessRunner` returning fixture JSON: argv construction per
      command; `--json`/`--concise` always present; config validation failures
      (relative path, empty transport); a `schemaVersion` mismatch refused; an
      unlabeled hit refused; a hit above the ceiling sealed; the notice
      attached; availability gating in the descriptor tables; capability
      description lists the tools only when configured.
- [ ] Documents: `packages/cf-harness/docs/LOOM_RETRIEVAL.md` (new, the
      sibling of `packages/cf-harness/docs/LOOM_AUTHORING.md`),
      `packages/cf-harness/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROFILE.md` tool list,
      `packages/cf-harness/docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` supported surfaces,
      `packages/cf-harness/README.md` where it lists
      Loom tools; `deno task check-skill-facts` if a skill cites a path.

*Exit:* a batch run with `--loom-retrieval-config` and a scripted model answers
a search and a people lookup from fixture output, the run report shows the
tool calls, and a run without the config offers none of the tools.

## Stage 2 — The result writer in the harness

**Package:** `packages/cf-harness` (host side), one small `packages/runner`
export. **Depends on:** nothing (stage 1 only supplies more referent kinds).

The writer is the harness routine of design §1.3. It runs on the trusted host
over the fabric session's runtime and is called by the runner of stage 4 after
a run reaches its structured result. It is not a model tool.

- [ ] `src/result-writer.ts` — `writeAgentResult({ session, handleTable,
      modelContext, structuredResult, resultSchema, observedHandles })`
      returning `{ link, joinLabel, mintedDocuments }`. Steps, in one
      transaction on `session.pieces.runtime`:
      1. `validateAndSanitizeStructuredResultValue` against `resultSchema`
         (existing, `src/structured-result.ts`).
      2. Walk the value; at every position holding a handle token or the
         canonical link string the inbound swap produces, resolve through
         `resolveHandleRef` against the run's table — unheld fails the write
         (AH-REF-2). A cell referent becomes its link. A non-cell referent
         (a Loom row the run observed, a SQLite row) becomes a new document
         written with the referent's disclosed label declared through the
         document schema's `ifc.confidentiality`, and its link.
      3. Read every observed cell (`observedHandles`) through the transaction
         so `collectConsumedLabel` sees them.
      4. `tx.setCfcImplementationIdentity({ kind: "builtin", builtinId: "agent" })`
         and write the result document with an `LlmDerived` stamp schema
         built the way `withLlmDerivedStamp` builds one for `generateObject`
         (`packages/runner/src/builtins/llm.ts`); export that helper from
         `@commonfabric/runner/cfc` or a sibling so the harness does not copy
         it.
      5. Commit; return the result link and the join the transaction derived.
- [ ] Refusal handling: a commit the boundary refuses surfaces as a typed
      writer failure carrying the refusal code and no label detail, the way
      `run_pattern` reports `cfc_release_withheld`; the runner maps it to
      `refused`.
- [ ] Tests, `test/result-writer.test.ts`, on an in-memory runtime with
      fixture cells of two labels and one observed Loom row: one result
      document, three links, targets keep their labels, inline text carries
      the join of both cell labels, the minted row document carries the row's
      label, the result carries `LlmDerived`; an unheld handle fails before
      any write; a handle at a non-`asCell` position still becomes a link; a
      value above a declared ceiling at an `asCell` position is sealed rather
      than written.
- [ ] Documents, under `packages/cf-harness/`: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROFILE.md`
      (the writer as a trusted host path, AH-TOOL-7), `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`.

*Exit:* the stage-2 test file passes and CFC inspection (`cf inspect`) of the
written space shows the labels the test asserts.

## Stage 3 — The `agent` builtin

**Packages:** `packages/api`, `packages/runner`, `packages/static`.
**Depends on:** nothing at compile time; stage 4 gives it a real executor.

- [ ] `packages/api/index.ts` — `BuiltInAgentParams { task, inputs, resultSchema,
      maxConfidentiality?, tools? }` and `BuiltInAgentState<T> { pending,
      result?, error?, requestHash?, run? }` beside `BuiltInGenerateObjectParams`;
      `packages/static/assets/types/commonfabric.d.ts` regenerated or edited
      the way that file is maintained for the other builtins.
- [ ] `packages/runner/src/builder/built-in.ts` — `export const agent =
      createNodeFactory({ type: "ref", implementation: "agent" })`;
      `builder/factory.ts` — export; `builder/builtin-replayability.ts` — row
      (non-replayable, effectful).
- [ ] `packages/runner/src/builtins/agent-schemas.ts` — params schema
      (`inputs` entries `asCell`, never values; `task` a string; `tools` an
      enum over the tool names the deployment publishes), result schema, and
      a reference to the shared `LlmDerived` stamp schema.
- [ ] `packages/runner/src/builtins/agent.ts` — the raw builtin, modeled on
      `generateObject` in `llm.ts`:
      - resolve inputs to links, snapshot the request with
        `createFrozenRequestSnapshot`, hash it;
      - memo: an existing `AgentRun` record for this `requestHash` in this
        instance means no new record and `pending`/`result` derive from it;
        a stored `requestHash` with no record and no result — the request
        committed and its effect did not run — is a new request and is staged
        again, the way `generateObject` treats a stored hash with neither
        result nor error;
      - stage the sink request under sink `agent` through
        `enqueueSinkRequestPostCommitEffect`, whose post-commit effect
        *creates the `AgentRun` record* (stage 4's schema) in the requesting
        space, `PerUser`, with the request fields — keyed by `requestHash`, so
        an effect that runs twice creates one record — and appends a `{link, host}`
        entry to the requester's home index through the `.inSpace` crossing;
      - derive `pending`, `result`, `error` from the record's `state`,
        `result`, `outcome`, and `errorCode` by reading the record reactively;
      - `onRejected`: settle `pending: false` with an opaque error, the way
        the llm builtins do.
- [ ] Tool check: a request whose `tools` names a tool absent from the
      requester's `agentRunner.tools` entry (stage 4) fails before staging
      with `INVALID_INPUT`; when no `agentRunner` entry exists the request
      stages and stays `queued`.
- [ ] `packages/runner/src/cfc/sink-inventory.ts` — `"agent"` in
      `InitialSinkName` and `KNOWN_SINKS`; a sink-class field beside the
      inventory so the gate mints `sinkClass: "agent"` for this sink and
      keeps `"network"` for the rest (`prepare.ts`, `verifySinkRequestCeilings`,
      replacing the hardcoded literal with a lookup).
- [ ] `packages/runner/src/runtime-presets.ts` — the `agent` row in
      `MAX_ENFORCEMENT_SINK_GOVERNANCE`: a ceiling equal to the request's
      observation ceiling, which means the row is computed per request. If
      the registry's type only admits a static clause list, the row declares
      `[]` and the builtin meets its request against `maxConfidentiality`
      itself before staging, with a comment saying which of the two arms
      holds; record the choice in the design document's D5.
- [ ] `packages/runner/src/builtins/index.ts` — registration with the result
      cell type.
- [ ] Tests in `packages/runner/test/`: `agent-builtin.test.ts` (inputs
      serialized as links, task text as value, memo hit creates no record,
      abandonment settles, `pending`/`result` derive from a record a fake
      runner mutates); `agent-sink-governance.test.ts` (the `agent` row is
      total, the class is `agent`, a request whose task carries `User(other)`
      is refused under max enforcement, a request passing cells fits); the
      CFC audit goldens that list sinks, regenerated with
      `deno task cfc-audit-fixtures` and reviewed; the existing pinned
      ungated-llm tests unchanged.
- [ ] Documents: `docs/specs/server-side-execution/builtins.md` §2 row;
      `sink-inventory.ts` JSDoc; `docs/development/EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS.md`
      if the builtin ships behind a flag (recommended: `agentBuiltin`, default
      off until stage 6); `docs/common/` a pattern-author page for `agent()`
      linked from `docs/common/README.md`; `docs/plans/cfc-llm-sink-admission.md`
      — note that the sink-class field now exists.

*Exit:* a pattern test in `packages/runner/test` builds a graph with `agent()`,
sees a `queued` record appear on commit, has a fake runner write `completed`
and a result link, and observes `pending: false` and `result` on the node.

## Stage 4 — Records, index, runner

**Packages:** `packages/patterns/system` (record and index schemas),
`packages/runner` (the `#agent_queue` wish target), `packages/cli` (the
runner). **Depends on:** stages 2 and 3.

- [ ] Record schema — `packages/patterns/system/agent-run.tsx` exporting the
      `AgentRun` type of design §2.3 as a pattern-facing schema with `PerUser`
      scope, the `cancel` stream, and the writer split documented in the
      type's comments: request fields server-written at creation, everything
      from `claim` on runner-written. `packages/runner/src/builtins/agent.ts`
      imports the schema rather than duplicating it.
- [ ] Split-writer check (assumption 9): a runner test that writes progress
      fields as an authored client into a record the server derived, under
      server execution enabled. If the single-deriver rule refuses the write,
      move the runner-written fields to `AgentRunProgress`, a sibling document
      the runner creates on claim and the record links to, and update design
      §2.3 in the same change.
- [ ] Home index — `packages/patterns/system/agent-queue.tsx`: a piece holding
      `entries: { run: link, host: string }[]` and the `agentRunner` entry
      `{ host, tools, registeredAt, lastClaimAt }` owner-protected the way
      `ProfileInboxPointer` is on `profile-home.tsx`; held by `home.tsx` in an
      `agentQueue` field of the home default pattern, beside `favorites` and
      `journal`, and discovered with
      `wish({ query: "#agent_queue", headless: true })`.
- [ ] `packages/runner/src/builtins/wish.ts` — `#agent_queue` as a well-known
      home-space target resolving to `defaultPattern.agentQueue` of the home
      space, beside `#journal` and `#learned`. A hashtag search under
      `scope: ["~"]` reads favorites only, so it would not find the piece.
      Tests beside the existing well-known-target tests; the target added to
      the well-known list in `docs/common/conventions/wish.md`.
- [ ] Runner — `packages/cli/commands/agent.ts` with subcommand `runner`,
      registered in `commands/main.ts`. Configuration: identity, cloud and
      local API URLs, `--loom-retrieval-config`, `--max-concurrent` (default
      1), `--tools` (defaults to what the Loom config makes available),
      harness provider settings from `CF_HARNESS_HOME`. Behavior:
      1. open client sessions to both toolsheds as the identity;
      2. write or refresh the `agentRunner` entry;
      3. subscribe to the index; on change, claim the oldest `queued` record
         under the concurrency cap by committing `state: claimed`, `claim`,
         and `attempts` incremented;
      4. build a `HarnessSessionConfig` — input handles from the record's
         request links, `cfc.maxConfidentiality` from the request, tools
         from `tools`, `loomRetrieval` from the config, prompt-slot role
         `context` for the task — and run `CfHarnessPromptLoop.runPrompt`
         through `harnessSessionEngineOptions`;
      5. renew `claim.leaseUntil` on every durable write the run makes (the
         transcript and event writes the harness already persists), never on
         a timer;
      6. on the structured result, call stage 2's writer; write terminal
         fields (`result`, `outcome`, `usage` from the run report's
         `totalUsage`, `usageCoverage`, `modelTurns`, `toolCalls`, `runRef`);
      7. on a typed harness failure write `failed` with the taxonomy code; on
         a writer refusal write `refused`; on `cancel` abort through the
         harness's `signal` and write `cancelled`;
      8. on start, and on each index change, take any `claimed` or `running`
         record whose `leaseUntil` has passed: re-queue it when its `attempts`
         is one, and fail it as `RUNNER_LOST` when its `attempts` is two.
- [ ] Error taxonomy — one module in `packages/runner` (or `packages/api`)
      exporting the codes `INVALID_INPUT`, `LIMIT_REACHED`, `PROVIDER_FAILURE`,
      `RUNNER_LOST`, `CANCELLED`, `REFUSED`, shared with the verb-refusal
      taxonomy the retention plan owes; the design document's §2.3 names it.
- [ ] Tests: `packages/cli/test/agent-runner.test.ts` with a fake executor
      (an injected `createPromptLoop` returning a scripted loop, the seam
      `packages/cf-harness/src/cli.ts` already exposes as
      `deps.createPromptLoop`) over two
      in-process test toolsheds (the multi-runtime harness, one memory server
      per toolshed): every state transition; the memo hit creates no record;
      two runners racing claim once; a killed runner's record, left `claimed`
      or left `running`, re-queues once then fails; `cancel` mid-run ends `cancelled`; the `agentRunner` entry
      appears and refreshes on claim; a cloud-hosted record is found from a
      local runner through a `{link, host}` entry. Pattern tests for
      `agent-queue.tsx` and `agent-run.tsx` under `packages/patterns/system`.
- [ ] Documents: `packages/cli/README.md` — `cf agent runner`;
      `docs/common/conventions/HOME_SPACE.md` — the `#agent_queue` piece and
      `agentRunner` entry beside favorites; `docs/development/LOCAL_DEV_SERVERS.md`
      — how to start a runner against `dev-local`.

*Exit:* the stage-4 runner test suite passes across two test toolsheds, and a
manual run against `dev-local` with a real harness and a scripted model moves
a record from `queued` to `completed` with a result link that resolves.

## Stage 5 — Inspection

**Packages:** `packages/cli`, `packages/patterns/system`. **Depends on:**
stage 4.

- [ ] `cf agent ls [--state <s>] [--json]`, `cf agent show <run> [--json]`,
      `cf agent cancel <run>` in `commands/agent.ts`, reading the index through
      the same wish the Home tab uses; `show` renders the usage block with
      `costUsd` and `estimatedCostUsd` kept apart and names the withheld
      reason when there is one.
- [ ] Completion candidates for `--state` and for `<run>` in the tables
      `tasks/check-completion-slots.ts` reads, or a recorded reason.
- [ ] Home tab "Agent runs" in `packages/patterns/system/home.tsx`: a fourth
      `cf-tab` rendering `agent-queue.tsx` — state, age, usage per record,
      a cancel action, and a "no runner registered" notice when `agentRunner`
      is absent.
- [ ] Tests: `packages/cli/test/agent-command.test.ts` (list, show, cancel
      against a seeded index); `home.test.tsx` gains the tab; a pattern test
      renders three records, one finished with usage, and the no-runner
      notice.
- [ ] Gates: `deno task check-command-docs`, `deno task check-completion-slots`,
      `deno task check-test-aliases` if any test is renamed.
- [ ] Documents: `packages/cli/README.md` — the three commands;
      `docs/common/conventions/HOME_SPACE.md` — the tab.

*Exit:* both gates pass and the tab shows a live record moving through states
against `dev-local`.

## Stage 6 — The demonstration

**Package:** `packages/patterns`. **Depends on:** stages 1–5.

- [ ] `packages/patterns/book-recommendations/` — a pattern holding a
      reader's finished books (`PerUser`, each book its own cell) and favorite
      authors, calling `agent()` with `tools: ["loom_search", "loom_page_read"]`
      and a result schema of five `{ book: asCell link, why: string }`
      entries, rendering pending state, the result, and the run's usage.
- [ ] A Loom fixture: a `ProcessRunner` fake or a fixture Loom instance
      returning two search hits and one page read with `ifc` labels.
- [ ] `cf test` for the pattern with a scripted model; an integration test
      under `packages/patterns/integration/` running the real harness with
      the scripted model against `dev-local`, asserting through `cf inspect`
      that the result document carries the join and `LlmDerived`, the five
      links resolve to the book cells with their own labels, and the minted
      Loom-row document carries the row's label.
- [ ] Flip the `agentBuiltin` flag default on, or record why it stays off.
- [ ] Archive `agent-requests-and-work-queue.md` and this document to
      `docs/history/plans/` per `docs/README.md`, add the `INDEX.md` lines,
      and run `deno task check-docs-history-index` and
      `deno task docs-links --orphan`.

*Exit:* the owner's example runs end to end and its CFC inspection reads as
the design says.

## Stage 7 — Ceilings that hold

**Packages:** `packages/runner`, `packages/cf-harness`. **Depends on:**
stage 6 for the demonstration to re-run against; otherwise independent and
may start earlier.

- [ ] Deviation 9: carry `cfcReadMaxConfidentiality` into the cell read path
      so a labeled cell outside the ceiling reads as withheld
      (`packages/runner/src/cfc/read-ceiling.ts` and the transaction read
      path); retire the session-scope requirement `run_pattern`'s description
      states; update `packages/cf-harness/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROFILE.md`
      deviation 9 and `packages/cf-harness/README.md` §ceiling.
- [ ] Deviation 8 / CT-2217: `delegate_task` carries the parent's observation
      ceiling into the child profile and rejects an inherited handle whose
      resolved value exceeds it (AH-CFC-12a); retire the AUD-23 known-defect
      row in `packages/cf-harness/audit/checks/known-defects.ts` and
      `packages/cf-harness/audit/conformance-manifest.ts`.
- [ ] Group ceilings: a runner test with `maxConfidentiality:
      [{anyOf:[User(A),User(B)]}]` over cells labeled `User(A)`, `User(B)`,
      and `[User(A),User(B)]`, asserting which enter model context.
- [ ] Documents: the deviation list, `docs/specs/agent-harness/03-conformance.md`
      conformance statement if a class flips.

*Exit:* the stage-6 integration test passes with the ceiling enforced by the
runtime read path rather than by the tools alone, and the two deviations are
retired from the profile.

## Stacking and parallelism

Stages 1, 2, and 3 have no dependency on each other and can be built in
parallel by three agents in three worktrees. Stage 4 needs all three. Stages 5
and 6 follow 4 in order. Stage 7 can start any time after stage 2 and lands
after 6.

Each stage is its own pull request, catch-up merged from `origin/main` before
each push, shepherded to green with the repository's gates and Cubic's review
read through `gh api --paginate repos/commonfabric/labs/pulls/<n>/comments`.

## What is deliberately not in this plan

Ranking (`priority` stays reserved). A durable per-user ledger and quota
enforcement. Page and calendar mutation tools. A shared runner with delegated
identity. Folding hosted pattern authoring into an agent request. Each is
named in the design document under "Later, not sequenced" and gets its own
plan when it is picked up.
