# Shaped reads and verb results — implementation plan

Sequences the read layer and the calls layered on it, as designed in
[Reading Fabric data](fabric-read-model.md) and
[Shaped reads and verb results](shaped-reads-and-verb-results.md). Read the
design first; this document assumes it and does not restate it.

The command surface — the third concern in that umbrella,
[CLI surface shape](cli-surface-shape.md) — is out of scope here and moves on
its own timeline. One piece of it is unavoidable: the concise selection syntax
needs its own flag before it can grow address notation, so `--select` lands in
the first stage rather than waiting.

## Governing decisions

**One read step, several arrivals.** `cf piece get`, `cf piece call`, and
`cf wish` are different operations that end in the same place: a cell, and a
caller who wants structured output. That terminal step is factored out once and
shared. No arrival grows its own output handling.

**A selection is a schema.** Schemas are queries here; what a reader supplies is
a schema like any other, differing in authority rather than in kind. The
concise syntax is a shorthand that desugars into one.

**Addresses are marked, not inferred.** A `$link` marker beside `properties`
says "give me the address at this position rather than its contents". Nothing is
derived from what a selection omitted.

**Treatment keywords stay the source's.** `asCell`, `default`, `scope` and `ifc`
are never a reader's to supply, in either syntax, and this work adds no
carve-out.

**The address change lands before addresses are published.** Scoping invocation
ids to a session changes where a receipt lives. Doing that before anything hands
a caller a receipt address means no caller ever holds one that later moves.

## What is settled

Both questions this work once waited on are decided, and the design records
them.

**Receipts carry a descriptive schema**, distinct from the declared result
schema that waits for the Fabric-types stream design. The compatibility gate
compares only a pattern's argument and result schemas across versions, so it
never reaches a receipt and no permanence obligation attaches.

**Invocation ids are scoped to a session**, not a principal. An identity
separates nothing when agents work under their human user's key, and a minted
session is unguessable where a DID is public.

**An id you chose needs a session you kept.** Three cases:

| Supplied | Result |
| --- | --- |
| neither | both are minted — a random id, and a one-time session for this request |
| `--invocation` only | error |
| `--invocation-session` only | the id is minted, scoped to the session named |
| both | replayable, and scoped to that session |

Naming an invocation asks for an outcome to be addressable and replayable, and a
session minted per request guarantees the id will not mean the same receipt next
time — so the request cannot be honored as asked, and saying so is better than
appearing to work while a later replay quietly re-executes.

Minting both when neither is given costs nothing and buys uniformity. An
auto-minted id is already random, so it cannot collide and cannot be guessed;
scoping it to a session it will never reuse changes no behavior. What it avoids
is a second derivation shape — the address is always
`hash{id, session, stream link}`, so nothing downstream carries a branch for
whether a session was involved.

## Backlog

**Emit a verb's declared result schema onto `module.resultSchema`.** The field
exists, `lift()` already populates it, and the runner already consumes it; what
is missing is the transformer emitting one for `handler()` and the runtime
signature accepting it. It would give discovery — a caller could learn a result's
shape before calling — and turn C1's description into a declaration.

The permanence objection that withdrew result-schema emission in July does not
reach it: that put a `result` keyword *inside* a schema, sibling to `asCell`,
landing in `Pattern.resultSchema`, which the compatibility gate compares across
versions and would then refuse to let go. `module.resultSchema` is a separate
field on a node, and `assertPatternSchemasBackwardCompatible` only ever compares
a pattern's two top-level schemas. Baselines would gain content, which the
append-only gate permits — it forbids deleting baselines, not enriching new ones.

Worth its own conversation with the owner who made that call, since it is
adjacent work even though the objection misses.

## Non-goals

Collection windowing, recovery of an outcome whose address was lost, batching,
a canonical locator, and the command-surface renames. Each is recorded as
deferred in the design documents, with the condition that would reopen it.

## Stage 1 — foundation

F1 is invisible to a caller; F2 and F3 are the flag surface the rest of this
plan is written against.

**F1. Factor the read step out.** *(M)* One implementation turning a cell and a
selection into structured output, with `piece get` as its first caller.

Its shape is the thing to get right, because three more callers arrive later. It
takes a **cell**, not a piece address — resolving an address to a cell belongs to
the caller, which is what lets `piece call` hand it a receipt and `wish` hand it
a resolved target. It takes the selection already parsed, so each arrival owns
its own flag surface. It returns the structured value, leaving rendering to the
caller. The existing transform in `packages/cli/lib/piece-get-transform.ts` is
the body of it; this is an extraction, not a rewrite.

Three decisions inside F1. The `PieceGetTransform` type is renamed — it is the
caller's **selection**, and its current name asserts a piece where none is
required, which is the misnaming the CLI surface document objects to elsewhere.
`runtime` and `space` stay explicit parameters rather than being derived from
the cell: `runtime` is not on the public `Cell` interface, and the caller's
space is not always the cell's, so deriving would silently relocate where the
transform pattern runs. And the verb-read refusal stays with `piece get` rather
than moving into the shared step, which keeps the step free of policy and leaves
open whether call results should inherit it.

*Exit:* `piece get` reads through the factored step and
`packages/cli/test/piece-get-transform.test.ts` passes **untouched** — not one
expectation added, moved, or removed. That is the whole test of a refactor, and
it is worth stating alone because the two items below deliberately change what
the flags accept. A moved expectation here means the extraction changed
behavior and is wrong.

**F2. `--select` for the concise syntax.** *(S)* The concise path list moves to
its own flag; `--schema` keeps full schemas and `@file`. Concise input on
`--schema` continues to work, without a warning — there is no removal date yet,
and warning on every invocation would be noise in the skills that teach it.

*Exit:* both flags work, a concise list on `--schema` still works and warns
about nothing, and naming both on one command is refused.

**F3. A projection schema is checked against an allowlist.** *(M)* Today two
denylists are consulted and every key in neither is accepted and ignored. So a
typo (`propertys`) selects nothing and says nothing, and any keyword given a
meaning later changes behavior for schemas that already carry it, with no error
ever having been raised.

Three tiers replace the two lists. **Honored**: the keys projection acts on.
**Tolerated**: the annotation and validation keywords, ignored but not refused —
this tier has to exist, because a caller is told to lift a source schema and
prune it, and a lifted schema is full of them. **Anything else**: refused by
name.

Deciding the second tier's membership is the work; the check itself is small.
The reason it is worth the work is that a projection which quietly returns `{}`
is the same failure this plan has already had to fix twice — a missing `type`
and an untyped `items` root each returned nothing and reported nothing.

*Exit:* an unrecognized key is refused and the message names it; a tolerated
keyword is accepted and ignored; an honored keyword is unaffected.

This one does change behavior, and the change is the point. No key that is
honored or legitimately carried changes meaning. But a command that ran only
because a key was silently dropped now fails loudly — `--select` is unaffected,
while `--schema '{"propertys":{…}}'` exits zero with `{}` today and is refused
after. Counting that as a regression would be counting the fix as the defect.

## Stage 2 — addresses in results

**A1. `$link` in a selection.** *(M)* The projection-only keyword becomes
meaningful: a marked position returns its address rather than its contents,
rendered as the declared link shape and not the runtime envelope.

Note what it becomes meaningful *from*. `$link` is in neither key set today, so
it is carried through and ignored rather than refused — a schema already
containing it changes behavior with no error having warned. The population at
risk is empty in practice, since `$link` is not a source-schema keyword and
lifting one cannot produce it. F3 is what stops the next key from having this
story.

**A2. Compose the rejecting selector.** *(M)* A marked position contributes a
rejecting selector to the path union the projection already builds, so its
target is never loaded. This is what makes a marked collection cost one document
rather than one per element.

**A3. `@` in `--select`.** *(S)* The suffix desugars to `{"$link": true}` at the
leaf, in place. `topic@,topic.title` unions into a marker plus a projection and
renders as one result carrying both. `@` is special only as the final character
of a path segment, and `\@` escapes it, so a field genuinely named `user@home`
stays reachable.

**A4. `--piece` accepts the entity URI.** *(S)* `entityIdFrom` takes an `of:`
scheme and refuses `computed:` rather than stripping it. Independent of
everything else here, and everything that composes an emitted address into a
following command waits on it.

**A5. An object that asks for nothing is not read.** *(S)* `projectionMask`
reduces an *array* whose items reject to `false`, because array traversal
follows each element's link before it consults the item schema — a rejection one
level down arrives after the load it was meant to prevent. An **object** whose
every property rejects gets no such reduction, so it stays a non-rejecting
selector.

The two compose badly. Marking a field *below* a link — `notes.title@` — gives
each element the mask `{properties: {title: false}}`, which is not `false`, so
the array's `items` is not `false`, so the array does not reduce, so traversal
loads every element document. The addresses are correct and cost nothing extra
to render; the read is simply not free the way a marker on the link itself is.
Measured at four document reads where one would do.

The fix is the symmetric reduction, which then cascades: an all-rejecting object
becomes `false`, the array's `items` becomes `false`, the array reduces, and the
fetch is suppressed at the top. What wants care is that `false` at a position
changes what the projector receives there, not just what the selector asks for.

*Exit:* a created child's address survives a read, composes into the next
command without reshaping, and a marked collection is measurably one document —
including when the marker sits below a link rather than on it.

## Stage 3 — session identity

Ahead of anything that publishes a receipt address, so no caller holds one that
later moves.

**S1. Mint and plumb a session.** *(M)* `cf invocation-session new` emits a
bare random string on stdout — no file format, since unlike `cf id new` there is
no key material and a keyfile shape would only be cargo-culted.
`--invocation-session` and `CF_INVOCATION_SESSION` carry it, following
`CF_IDENTITY` and `CF_API_URL`. Accepted and threaded through, but **not yet
joined to the hash** — nothing observable changes, and the mechanism can be
exercised before it matters.

*The name is qualified deliberately, command and flag alike.* `cf inspect`
already takes `--session`, meaning a storage session — a different thing
entirely, in the same binary. One word for two concepts is what this arc spent
its first document untangling elsewhere, so it is not worth introducing here.
Qualifying the new surface is free today because nothing uses it yet;
`cf inspect`'s could become `--storage-session` later, which is a change to a
forensics tool with its own callers and is not part of this work.

*It is closer to a secret than to a setting.* Its unguessability is what keeps
an outcome's address out of reach of anyone who can guess a piece, a verb, and a
conventional id. A flag value is visible in process listings where an
environment variable is not, so the environment form is the one to teach and the
flag is the override.

**S2. Join the session to the hash.** *(S)* The session enters the hash
`scopeCallerEventId` computes, so an id chosen in one agent's session and in
another's land on different receipts. `--invocation` without a session becomes
an error.

*What that breaks, measured.* Nothing relies on unscoped matching incidentally;
what relies on it is the tests of the property itself.
`packages/cli/integration/verbs-over-the-cli.sh` replays one id to assert
deduplication, and `packages/cli/integration/integration.sh` has four retry
scenarios (of six) doing the same across separate processes. All of them pass a session
after this, which is the change rather than a casualty of it.

This is the one address-changing commit in the plan. It carries nothing else,
lands in a single deploy, and does not roll out behind a flag that would leave
two addressing schemes live at once.

*Exit:* two sessions using the same invocation id against the same verb resolve
to different receipts; one session replaying an id resolves to the same one.

## Stage 4 — calls

**C1. Receipt cells carry a descriptive schema.** *(M)* Derived from the value
the runtime has just written and stored in the durable schema metadata, in the
same create-only transaction. Not the `getCell` schema argument, which seeds
link scope and the in-memory cell only. Structural — root container kind and
property names — since that is what narrowing needs, and recording link
positions would mean writing `asCell` onto a document nothing can be written
through. Lands before C2 so a selection over a receipt is bounded from the first
call that can express one.

*Plain results only, which leaves the flagship case out.* Deriving a shape needs
a settled value, and a result holding anything reactive has none when the
receipt is written — so a verb returning a child piece, which is what the
walkthrough fixture does, gets no schema. What that costs is narrower than it
sounds: a `$link` marker still renders an address and still suppresses the
fetch, because a rejecting selector short-circuits before a source schema is
consulted. What is lost is narrowing on field selection, and checking a
selection before the call. The backlog item above is what closes it.

*Why descriptive rather than declared.* A verb's declared result type does not
survive compilation: `handler()` takes an event schema and a state schema, its
`R` is type-level only, and the transformer emits nothing for it. The field it
would travel on — `module.resultSchema` — exists and is already populated by
`lift()`, so filling it for handlers is the better end state, and the receipt's
schema slot would then take a better-sourced value rather than a migration. That
work is on the backlog below, not here.

**C2. `piece call` gains the selection flags.** *(S)* `--select`, `--schema`,
`--filter`, all routed through F1. No second output path.

**C3. `receipt` as a top-level envelope field.** *(S)* Published from
`tx.handlingReceiptLink`, so a caller holds the address before the outcome
exists — including under `--no-wait`, which today returns none.

*Exit:* a verb's result and the same data read directly render identically under
the same selection, and the walkthrough's `jq | sed` address extraction is
replaced by reading the rendered address.

## Stage 5 — the remaining arrivals

`get` and `call` are two of four ways to arrive at a cell. The surface shape this
plan serves gives the same read options to every arrival that returns data, so a
caller learns one vocabulary rather than one per command. Two arrivals are left,
and leaving them out is worse than never having started: a vocabulary that works
from two starting points and silently does nothing from the other two teaches a
rule that is false half the time.

**W1. `cf wish` gains the read options.** *(S)* `--select`, `--schema`,
`--filter`, routed through the same step. A wish resolves to whatever satisfies
it rather than to an address, but it still terminates in a cell, and that is the
part being shaped.

*Ordering against handle-stripping.* `projectWishValue` walks the resolved value
and replaces every cell, stream and function with a marker, breaking cycles and
collapsing diamonds on the way — it is what makes the result renderable at all.
A `$link` marker needs a live cell to read an address from, so the selection runs
**before** that walk, on the value that still holds handles. Applying it after
would leave a marked position with nothing to render and no way to say so. The
two are not alternatives: the selection decides what is returned, the walk
decides how what remains is written down.

*A wish may match nothing, and may match many.* Both are ordinary outcomes, not
errors, and a selection must not turn either into one. Whether a selection
applies to each match or to the collection of them is the question this stage
settles; the answer follows whatever `--filter` already means against a wish
result, and should not be invented fresh.

**W2. `cf exec` gains the read options.** *(S)* Same three flags, same step.

*And the address it already prints.* `exec` reports its result cell on stderr as
`Tool result cell: <id> (space <space>, scope <scope>)` — prose, in a spelling
that is neither the rendered `$link` shape nor what `--show-links` emits, and
that a caller cannot pass to another command without reshaping it. This stage is
where that becomes the declared shape, because it is the one time the code is
open for this reason. Keeping the stderr line is fine; keeping a third spelling
of an address is not.

*Exit:* the same cell, reached by `get`, by `call`, by `wish` and by `exec`,
renders identically under the same selection, and an address emitted by any of
them is accepted by the next command unchanged.

## Dependencies

Stages are ordered, but not everything in them is blocked.

| Item | Blocked by | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | — | everything selection-shaped depends on it |
| F2 | — | independent of F1; grouped for one flag change |
| F3 | F1 | independent of F2; both are the flag surface |
| A1 | F1 | |
| A2 | A1 | |
| A3 | A1, F2 | needs both the marker and the flag |
| A4 | — | can land any time; grouped where its value shows |
| A5 | A2 | completes A2's property for a marker below a link; wanted before W1/W2, which inherit whatever a read costs |
| S1 | — | |
| S2 | S1 | must precede C3 |
| C1 | — | independent; ordered before C2 for the bound |
| C2 | F1, A1 | A1 for marked positions in call results |
| C3 | S2 | the ordering this plan exists to get right |
| W1 | F1, A1, C2 | C2 not for code, but so the second host sets the pattern the third follows |
| W2 | F1, A1, C2 | same, and independent of W1 |

## Test strategy

**F1 is a refactor, so its test is that nothing changes.**
`packages/cli/test/piece-get-transform.test.ts` passes untouched.

**A1–A3 extend the CLI integration walkthrough.**
`packages/cli/integration/pattern/verb-results.tsx` is already a fixture with a
returned child, and `verbs-over-the-cli.sh` already drives it; the walkthrough
gains steps rather than a new fixture. Three assertions worth pinning: a marked
position renders an address and not its contents; a marker beside a sibling
projection renders both; a marked collection issues one document read. The third
wants a unit test in `packages/cli/test/` rather than the shell walkthrough,
since counting reads is not observable from stdout.

**A4 is testable by identity**, as a unit test: the same piece resolves through a
bare hash and through its `of:` form, and `computed:` is refused by name rather
than coerced.

**A5 is a read count, and the existing counter already covers it.** The test
wrapping `storageManager.open(space).sync` asserts a marked collection syncs one
document; the case A5 fixes is the same assertion with the marker one level
lower. Worth pinning both, since they fail for different reasons: the marker on
the link tests that the selector rejects, and the marker below it tests that a
rejection propagates upward through the containers that hold it.

**S2 wants two sessions and one verb** — an integration test, since it is about
addresses that differ across processes. The negative case matters as much: one
session replaying an id must still deduplicate.

**C2's test is symmetry.** The same note read through `piece get` and read out of
a `piece call` result produce the same rendering under the same selection.

**W1 and W2 extend that symmetry to the other two arrivals**, which is the whole
claim: one cell, four ways in, one rendering. Worth its own assertion rather than
folding into C2's, because the failure it catches is a command quietly ignoring
a flag it accepted. A wish additionally wants its two ordinary outcomes pinned —
no match, and many matches — since a selection must leave both intact.

**Waiting.** Anything that needs a receipt to exist subscribes rather than polls
(`docs/development/waiting-in-tests.md`).

## Risks

**F1 is a refactor over code with a live consumer.** `piece get`'s projection is
recently changed and load-bearing for the topics workflow. The mitigation is
that F1 adds no surface: if its test expectations move, it has gone wrong.

**S2 changes where receipts live.** The ordering removes most of this — nothing
has published an address yet, so no caller holds one that moves. What remains is
in-flight retries across the deploy: an id issued before the change and replayed
after resolves somewhere new and re-executes rather than deduplicating. Bounded
to that window, and the reason S2 lands alone.

**Session scoping puts one more thing in the caller's keeping.** After S2 an
address depends on the session it was created under, so a caller who loses that
session id cannot recompute where its outcome went. That is the recovery case
already deferred in the design, now with a second input to retain alongside the
piece, verb and id. It argues for the session identity being something a harness
persists rather than something a human types.

**`$link` is a wire contract from A1 onward.** Its field defaults are specified
in the design; changing them after callers read them is the breakage the
declared shape exists to prevent.

**A partially-shaped surface is worse than an unshaped one.** Between C2 and
Stage 5 the read options work from two arrivals and not the other two, and
nothing in the CLI says which. That window is the argument for treating Stage 5
as part of this plan rather than as follow-up work: the cost of stopping after
C3 is not a missing feature, it is a rule that a caller learns and then finds
false. Sequencing it last is fine; dropping it is not.

## Documentation owed

Each step carries its own, rather than a sweep at the end.

| Step | Owed |
| --- | --- |
| F2 | `packages/cli/README.md` output conventions: two flags, which syntax each takes |
| A1, A3 | The marker and the suffix, same file; [Verbs over the CLI](../common/verbs-over-the-cli.md), already stale |
| A4 | Address forms wherever `--piece` is taught — the CLI README and the tutorial's workflow chapter |
| S1, S2 | `cf invocation-session new`, `CF_INVOCATION_SESSION`, and what an absent session means; the CLI README and the agent-facing skills that teach invocation ids |
| C1 | What a receipt declares, in the design document's open-question slot |
| C2, C3 | `piece call`'s section, and the envelope's fields |
| W1, W2 | `wish` and `exec` in `packages/cli/README.md`, and the read options stated once where all four arrivals can point at them rather than four times |
