# Reading Fabric data: one model, several arrivals

This is the umbrella for three concerns that share a model: **the read layer**,
**calls** layered on it, and **the command surface**. Two documents cover them,
since the first two are closely coupled and the third moves on its own timeline.

- [Shaped reads and verb results](shaped-reads-and-verb-results.md) — **the read
  layer, and calls.** How a read decides what to return, and what calling a verb
  adds on top.
- [CLI surface shape](cli-surface-shape.md) — **the command surface.** What it
  should look like, and how to get there without breaking callers.

Call-specific investigation detail — what produces a receipt and what its
existence proves, how its address is derived, the entity-URI change to
`--piece`, error conventions and sequencing — is collected in
[Verb calls: working notes](verb-result-selection.md). Sketches to draw from,
not a settled contract.

It assumes no prior familiarity with the runtime. If you want the full
background rather than the working vocabulary below,
[the tutorial](../tutorial/README.md) covers cells in chapter 2, what a cell
really is in chapter 8, and storage in chapter 9.

## Orientation

| Term | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **Space** | A store of data, named by a cryptographic identifier. Everything lives in exactly one space. |
| **Cell** | The unit of state — reactive, durable, and addressable. Behind each is a stored JSON document. |
| **Address** | Where a cell lives: a space, an entity id such as `of:fid1:abc…`, and optionally a path inside the document. |
| **Link** | A pointer from one cell to another, stored inline in a document. Following links is how one cell reaches another. |
| **Pattern** | A user-authored program declaring state and, optionally, callable operations. Components run once to wire up reactive state, in the style of Solid.js. |
| **Piece** | A running instance of a pattern in a space. What you address, read, and call. |
| **Verb** | A piece's callable operation, invoked with `cf piece call`. |
| **Receipt** | The cell the runtime writes when a verb finishes, holding whatever the verb returned. |
| **Schema** | A description of data's shape. Schemas are queries here: the runtime reads one to decide which documents to load and how to treat each value. |
| **Shape** | The schema supplied for one particular read — what this caller wants back. Written concisely or in full. |

Two ideas that carry most of the weight:

**A cell is a point in a graph, not a self-contained record.** Its document
holds values *and links to other cells*. Reading one without saying where to
stop follows those links onward, and onward again, so an innocuous-looking read
can return an enormous amount of unrelated data. That is the whole problem this
work exists to solve.

**Schemas are queries, not type annotations.** This is the schema-on-read
principle the rest of the system runs on: you describe the shape of the data you
want, and that description decides what gets loaded. Reactivity is a
subscription to a query whose selector is a schema, and a read works the same
way — the schema supplied becomes the set of paths fetched, so links outside it
are never followed.

A cell carries a schema and a reader supplies one. They are the same kind of
artifact; what differs is **authority**, not direction. The cell's schema is
authoritative for how a value is treated — whether it comes back as a handle,
what it defaults to, which partition it reads, who may see it. The reader's
selects among what is there.

## The model

**Everything addressable is a cell.** A piece is a cell — the function that
"gets a piece's result" returns the piece itself, and nothing in the read path
checks whether the thing you addressed is a piece at all. A receipt is a cell.
A piece's arguments are a cell, reached by following a link stored in its
document. There is no separate "piece object" behind the address you hold.

**Arrival is plural; reading is singular.** There are several genuinely
different ways to end up holding a cell:

| Arrival | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `cf piece get --piece <addr>` | addresses a cell directly |
| `cf piece call --piece <addr> <verb>` | runs a verb, then reads the receipt it wrote |
| `cf wish <query>` | resolves a query to whatever satisfies it |
| `cf exec <mountedFile>` | reaches a verb through a filesystem mount and runs it |

None of these should absorb the others — a query is not an address, and running
a verb is not reading. But all four end in the same place: you now hold a cell,
and you want structured data out of it.

That last step — **given a cell and a description of what you want, produce
structured output** — is one operation. The description says which positions
come back as values and which come back as addresses you can use later.

## Why this matters

The last step is not shared today, and the same note renders two different ways
depending on how you reached it. Read it from the board that holds it:

```json
{ "title": "Notes", "body": "…" }
```

Create it with a verb and read it out of the call's result, and its `append`
operation comes along as a raw internal pointer:

```json
{ "note": { "title": "Notes", "body": "…",
            "append": { "/": { "link@1": { "id": "of:fid1:…", … } } } } }
```

Neither behavior was designed. Each command grew its own output handling and
they drifted.

## What the model settles

Three questions dissolve rather than needing answers.

**How deep should a read follow links?** It does not traverse by depth at all. A
read selects by path, so paths outside the selection are never followed however
many hops away they sit.

**What format should a verb's result use?** The one a read already uses. Inside
the result, it *is* a read, on a different cell.

**What makes a receipt special?** Nothing. It is an ordinary cell, distinguished
only by being created without a schema — which is a defect rather than a
property.

## The three concerns

**The read layer.** Given a cell and a description of what you want, return
structured data. What is missing is a way for that description to say "give me
an address here, a value there" — which is what preserves a created thing's
identity instead of flattening it into a copy of its contents. Covered in
[Shaped reads and verb results](shaped-reads-and-verb-results.md).

**Calls, layered on it.** Running a verb writes a receipt; reading that receipt
is an ordinary read. What belongs to the call is the surrounding envelope, safe
retries, collecting a result later, and recovering an address when a response is
lost. Same document as the read layer.

**The command surface.** `piece` currently carries four unrelated jobs, two
commands are named `inspect`, two are named `view`, `--piece` names a cell
rather than a piece, and `--input` is an address disguised as a mode flag.
Covered in [CLI surface shape](cli-surface-shape.md).

## What follows from the split

Reads and calls stop blocking each other. The read layer can be settled against
`cf piece get`, which is where the load already is, and calls inherit it rather
than specifying a parallel format.

The command surface stops being a prerequisite. Sharing the read layer between
commands requires no renaming, so the naming and structure questions can be
argued on their own timeline instead of gating functional work.
