# Plans

Implementation plans that have not been fully executed. A pending plan is
live documentation: keep it accurate as the work proceeds (check off stages,
record scope changes).

When a plan has been executed or abandoned, it stops being a plan and becomes
a record: archive it to `docs/history/plans/` following the procedure in
[`../README.md`](../README.md).

## Current plans

- [Acquiring skills from the open internet](external-skill-acquisition.md)
  splits discovery from acquisition against a public skill registry: the
  registry answers what exists, a digest-verified `.well-known` entry or a git
  commit SHA answers for the bytes, the text loads by handle into a child the
  chooser never reads, and a split-mint provenance mark records where it came
  from without declassifying anything.
- [Collection naming: the first customer](collection-naming-topics.md)
  builds [Naming in collections](../specs/collection-naming.md) on a parallel
  exemplar board — a naming library, a member namespace the CLI and the shell
  resolve as `top/42`, and `#42` in the editor — proven against the Topics
  shape by a test-only board, and grafted onto Topics once, at the end.
- [`cf view` language and syntax coverage](cf-view-language-coverage.md)
  orders the remaining language, data, build, and configuration formats needed
  for honest coverage of the active organization repositories.
- [cf-harness Codex subscription authentication](cf-harness-codex-subscription-auth.md)
  tracks the remaining shipping gates after the core implementation.
- [CFC exchange-rule authoring](cfc-exchange-rule-authoring.md) tracks the
  remaining owner decisions and blocked stages for exchange rules.
- [CFC llm-sink admission](cfc-llm-sink-admission.md) tracks the
  boundary-scoped admission mechanism the max-enforcement posture names as
  pending for its llm sinks: public-only ceilings paired with class-scoped
  exchange rules, the llm sink class those rules need, and the owner decisions
  on which authority and which caveat tiers admit content to a model.
- [CFC TypeScript authoring](cfc_typescript_authoring.md) sequences the
  TypeScript and JSX authoring surface for CFC metadata.
- [`cf-code-editor` co-presence](cf-code-editor-copresence.md) adds an
  ephemeral Cloudflare WebSocket plane for live participant names, carets, and
  selections while Memory remains the sole authority for document contents.
- [First-class serializable factories](first-class-serializable-factories.md)
  sequences the implementation of durable pattern, module, and handler
  factories.
- [Hosted pattern authoring](hosted-pattern-authoring.md) sequences the shared
  server operation and the piece menu, Home, and `cf` entry points for changing
  a piece or creating a space from a request.
- [Developer-tooling feedback for hosted authoring](hosted-pattern-authoring-tooling-feedback.md)
  adds a separate, non-blocking way for an authoring agent to report missing or
  defective development capabilities.
- [Ingest channels and the journal sink](ingest-channels-journal-sink.md)
  proposes a minted, bearer-authed inbound endpoint that accumulates what it
  receives as a provenance-marked, append-only log — the shared capability
  behind webhooks, beacons, and any source with no runtime of its own. It
  builds on the split-mint seam in
  [`../features/vouched-ingest-channel-mint.md`](../features/vouched-ingest-channel-mint.md).
- [Integration-test video demos](integration-test-video-demos.md) tracks
  optional CI adoption and further fixture hardening.
- [Lazy cell materialization](lazy-cell-materialization.md) sequences a
  schema-observing lazy view over a cell, a transaction mode that hands one back
  from every read, and the runner disposition for a reader that touches data the
  schema no longer describes.
- [Choosing which tests a pull request runs](pull-request-test-selection.md)
  replaces the sixty-seven pull-request jobs with five, each running a subset
  chosen from what the record store knows about which tests have caught real
  regressions, and packed to finish inside five minutes. It carries the
  repository-side topology that lets a new test surface be registered once
  and picked up by both the full run and the selection, the scoring, flake
  and packing rules, and the two things a subset breaks and this replaces:
  coverage becomes a trend rather than a gate, and a regression that only
  `main` catches is reported back to the change that introduced it.
- [Memory `apply-op`](memory-apply-op.md) sequences the editor-neutral
  collaborative-field substrate, the first CodeMirror codec and editor
  integration, and the checkpoints and review gates required before a future
  WordGard codec.
- [Seed: pattern verbs as server calls](server-pattern-verbs-seed.md)
  records the ruled 2026-08-24 serverize direction — upload-pattern /
  instantiate / setsrc as server calls, client speculative-local with
  server-state winning, and the thin-CLI end-state — for the arc that picks
  it up.
- [Seed: codeless graph rebuild](codeless-graph-rebuild-seed.md) records,
  for a parked arc, the facts that make a running piece's graph durably
  reconstructible from scheduler state and module-addressed code — the
  recovery class the 2026-08-27 keyless close-out ruled out of contract.
- [Server-primary execution v2](server-execution-v2.md) sequences the
  greenfield rebuild that executes the server-side-execution v2 spec, with
  per-phase task and success-criteria checkboxes. Its
  [stage-C design](server-execution-v2/stage-c-design.md) is the
  reconciled design + build work order for the design build stage
  (demand as the memory server's tracked-ids closure with the demand
  walk deleted — the structural walk demoted to fallback — the client
  intent listener, the ruled double-dispatch implementation, the
  acceptance and the owner ruling set); it archives beside the stage-C
  closeout when that build lands.
- [Scheduled work in the server](scheduled-work-in-the-server.md) proposes the
  simpler form D12 said bgUpdater would come back as: a pattern declares the
  cadence it wants to wake on, and the space's own serving runtime honors it,
  so background work stops needing a separate process anyone has to run and
  keep online. Waking a piece on a timer with nobody watching is the one thing
  the background piece service does that the executor does not, and the ruling
  accepts that capability lapsing in the meantime — nothing depends on it, so
  nothing is broken while it is gone. Three separable parts: the replacement,
  the already-ruled deletion, which waits for nothing here and has a worked v1
  inventory to read, and compute accounting, which neither of the others
  depends on. The replacement rests on a further ruling, because a
  scheduled wake would be the second issuer of warm demand where the spec pins
  the count at one.
- [Revision-keyed schema memo](revision-keyed-schema-memo.md) designs a
  cross-evaluation, per-document memo of schema-walk computation on the
  memory server, keyed by each document's revision so validity needs no
  invalidation machinery, sitting under the query evaluation cache to make
  post-commit and cross-shape evaluations cost what changed instead of the
  whole corpus. Carries the measured baseline and the staged path to a
  per-revision snapshot cache.
- [Retention and CFC execution provenance](retention-and-provenance.md)
  sequences how long an invocation record is kept and what the runtime knows
  about who caused it — the `AgentActor` mint, trusted ingress, and metadata
  confidentiality. Gated on a CFC review that has not happened.
- [CFC runner implementation](runner_cfc_implementation.md) defines the
  commit-boundary enforcement workstreams and rollout.
- [Finishing the piece source lifecycle](piece-source-lifecycle-completion.md)
  compares the lifecycle spec against the repository and orders the remainder
  as five pull requests in two tracks — what a revision records, and where a
  space lives.
- [Bulk piece operations](piece-bulk-operations.md) designs retargeting,
  repairing, and rolling back many pieces as one reviewable, resumable
  operation over a shared plan — with batching as an execution strategy
  underneath rather than the subject.
- [The Topics verb surface](topics-verb-surface.md) sequences how the Topics
  board and topic grow their verbs without breaking the pieces already holding
  data: the shape the board demands of a stored topic, the one rehearsed break
  that narrowing it needs, and the items waiting on platform work.
- [`cf space clone` rehearsal](space-clone-rehearsal.md) records the design for
  rehearsal-grade copies of populated spaces. The tooling has shipped (`cf
  space`, `cf inspect churn`); the operating procedure lives in
  [`../development/space-clone-rehearsal.md`](../development/space-clone-rehearsal.md).
  The plan stays live until the practice has been exercised on a real
  migration.
- [Reading Fabric data](fabric-read-model.md) is the umbrella for one model
  across three concerns: everything addressable is a cell, so a verb's result
  and a direct read are the same operation on different cells. It carries the
  vocabulary and points at
  [shaped reads and verb results](shaped-reads-and-verb-results.md) — the shared
  read layer, how a shape says "an address here, a value there", and what
  calling a verb adds — and at
  [CLI surface shape](cli-surface-shape.md) for the command surface and an
  additive path to it. Start here rather than at either part.
- [References as arguments](references-as-arguments.md) proposes lifting
  address resolution out of the LLM dialog builtin, which already does it, and
  into the boundary every external caller crosses. An LLM and the CLI can
  hand a pattern a reference — the CLI in both spellings, converting the
  emitted address against the declared contract at its dispatch gate — while
  the webhook and ingest paths still forward a payload unresolved. It carries
  the measurement, the size, and the gate-by-gate evidence that the remaining
  refusal is drift rather than policy. The ruling it was once gated on is
  executed and archived:
  [the verb input contract](../history/plans/verb-input-contract.md).
- [Designing verbs so they can change](verb-evolution.md) records how verbs are
  declared so that adding to and changing them later is possible: verbs are
  promises and their names are stable by default — an owner may break their
  own pattern deliberately, so what a caller holds is a commitment rather than
  a guarantee — a holder declares only what it uses, an optional member's
  maybe is resolved once at binding, and an output change gets a new verb
  name. It states what the update gate enforces today, what
  the transformer and authoring tools should carry so a one-off author never
  has to learn a rule, and the open stream — named versioned interfaces,
  per-piece upgrade policy, migrations that run code — that everything else
  stands as the interim for. Written to be followable by anyone on the team,
  not only by pattern authors.
- [Verb calls: working notes](verb-result-selection.md) holds the call-specific
  investigation those documents do not carry: what produces a receipt and what
  its existence proves, how a receipt's address is derived, and the error and
  exit-status conventions. Sketches to draw from, not a settled contract.
- [Verbs — implementation plan](verbs-implementation.md) sequences the remaining
  work on verbs across both arcs that produced it: what a verb declares, what a
  caller may ask for, and what comes back. Read it for order; read the designs
  it points at for reasoning.
- [Shuttle — a place-aware fabric shell](shuttle/README.md) is the working design
  state for an interactive terminal tool: a REPL whose prompt carries a
  mutable current place — the context that fills in the omitted levels of the
  fabric's right-anchored references — plus full-screen live views, for
  inspecting and editing space and piece state. Decisions so far and open
  questions; construction is under way, in the order its
  [build sequence](shuttle/build-sequence.md) sets out.
- [Shell completion coverage](cli-completion-coverage.md) sequences the work
  that makes `cf completion` answer correctly across the surface it claims and
  reach the verb surface it does not: the slots that offer a wrong candidate,
  the verb flags and result shapes that offer none, the source `--space` needs
  before any of it is reachable by name, and the gate that keeps completion
  from falling behind the command tree again.
