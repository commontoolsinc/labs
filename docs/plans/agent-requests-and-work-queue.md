# Agent requests from a pattern, and the queue that runs them

**Status:** design, ruled on 2026-09-18;
[the implementation plan](agent-requests-implementation.md) tracks what is
built. Written against `c89aef10a3`. The Decisions table records the rulings
and the Assumptions section the assumptions the first take rests on.

## What this is

Two related capabilities, designed together because the second is what makes
the first operable:

1. **An agent request from a pattern.** A pattern asks the `cf-harness` agent
   runtime to do a piece of work — "which books has this user read that
   someone who likes A, B, C, D would also like, as this JSON shape" — where
   the inputs may be plain text or references to labeled cells, the agent may
   use Loom retrieval (`loom search`, `loom page …`, `loom people …`) to find
   and read the data, and the answer comes back as a structured value whose
   Contextual Flow Control (CFC) labels are intact. `PerUser<>` instances and
   confidentiality labels are respected, and a caller can lower what the run
   may observe with a confidentiality ceiling.
2. **A per-user work queue** of those requests. It bounds load, is rankable
   later, and every run's state and terminal outcome — including model cost —
   is readable from inside the platform: from patterns, from the shell, and
   from `cf`.

The first take is deliberately narrow: one new builtin, read-only Loom tools,
one queue record shape, one runner, one inspection surface. Everything that
can be added without changing a stored shape is deferred and named.

## Vocabulary

- **Agent request** — what a pattern submits: a task, its inputs, and the
  schema of the answer. One reactive node in the pattern's graph.
- **Agent run** — one execution of an agent request, and the durable record
  of it. The record is written as `AgentRun` and holds the run from `queued`
  to its terminal state; the terminal fields — outcome, timing, model usage
  and cost — live on the same record rather than in a separate receipt. The
  word matches the harness's own vocabulary (AH-LIFE-1) and its run report.
  "Receipt" is not used here, because it already names a verb's result
  readback cell in [`verb-result-selection.md`](verb-result-selection.md).
- **Ceiling** — a set of confidentiality clauses a flow must fit
  (`atomsOutsideCeiling`, `packages/runner/src/cfc/observation.ts`). The
  design uses two: the **request ceiling** at the sink and the **observation
  ceiling** on what the run may show its model.

## What exists, and what this builds on

The design is a composition of parts that are in the tree. Each is named once
here with where to read it, so that the rest of the document can refer to them
by name.

**The harness runs a bounded model and tool loop over handles, not values.**
A cell passed in by reference (`--input-cell`, `packages/cf-harness/src/input-cells.ts`)
reaches the model as an opaque token; `describe_handle` reports the referent's
shape and the atom *types* of its labels
(`packages/cf-harness/src/cfc-label-disclosure.ts`); reading anything behind a
token means running a pattern over it with `run_pattern`, whose answer values
are measured against an empty ceiling by `describeSinkReleaseRefusal` before
they enter model context (`packages/cf-harness/src/tools/run-pattern.ts`, the
comment above `RUN_PATTERN_ANSWER_CEILING`). A run carries a read ceiling
(`--max-confidentiality`, met into the fabric session's `cfcReadMaxConfidentiality`),
accumulates the labels of everything the model observed as influence
(`HarnessCfcModelContext`), validates and sanitizes a structured result against a
caller schema (`--structured-result-schema`, `src/structured-result.ts`), and
records per-attempt model usage with reported and estimated cost kept apart
(`HarnessModelUsage`, `src/model/client.ts`; AH-USAGE-1..6). Any new caller is
expected to produce a `HarnessSessionConfig` and hand it to
`harnessSessionEngineOptions` rather than assemble a session itself
(`src/session-assembly.ts`, its opening comment).

**The harness holds a host-side fabric session with a full runtime.** The
`run_pattern` tool compiles and instantiates patterns through a
`PiecesController` whose `runtime` is an ordinary client runtime acting as the
configured identity (`src/fabric-session.ts`). Nothing in the sandbox holds a
credential; every fabric write the harness makes today — a piece, a slug, a
source revision — is made by this host-side session. Writing a labeled
document is the same kind of write; the harness has no tool or host routine for
it yet.

**The harness already reaches Loom through a host-side command transport.**
`loom_compose`, `loom_inspect`, and `loom_authoring_context` run the operator's
Loom CLI with a cleared environment, structured arguments on stdin, and a
transport the model cannot change — a scoped broker queue or a pinned instance
(`packages/cf-harness/docs/LOOM_AUTHORING.md`). Those three tools are about
*looms* — durable ranked collections — not about retrieval. Loom itself
reaches the same sandboxes the other way round: its wish dispatcher sets
`LOOM_SEARCH_BROKER_QUEUE` and `LOOM_PAGE_RPC_QUEUE` and lets the agent run
`loom search` and `loom page` as shell commands through a file-queue broker
that injects the run's facet scope and read ceiling and grants only the routes
the run's capability profile allows (loom `src/lib/fabric_local_agent_rpc.py`).

**The runner has one shape for a request that leaves the graph.** An
effectful builtin (`llm`, `generateObject`, `fetch`, …) stages a sink request
inside the transaction; the commit boundary measures the transaction's
consumed labels against the sink's ceiling (`verifySinkRequestCeilings`,
`packages/runner/src/cfc/prepare.ts`); the request goes out only after the
commit is durable (`enqueueSinkRequestPostCommitEffect`); the result settles
into the node's result cell keyed by a request hash that doubles as the memo
key (`docs/specs/server-side-execution/builtins.md` §2). Every sink is a row
in `KNOWN_SINKS` and every posture decides every row
(`MAX_ENFORCEMENT_SINK_GOVERNANCE`, `packages/runner/src/runtime-presets.ts`);
a new sink is a compile error until it has one. Model output is stamped
`LlmDerived` at the write, attributed to the builtin through
`setCfcImplementationIdentity` so that a pattern cannot forge the stamp
(`packages/runner/src/builtins/llm.ts`, `attributeModelOutputWrite`). Trusted
host code can set the same identity; pattern code cannot.

**A document's label is the transaction's join, and a link is a boundary.**
`collectConsumedLabel` unions every read; `deriveFlowJoin` stamps that union on
every written path of every written document. A link names another document
without carrying it, so a value that *references* content of a different
label keeps the reference's label on the pointer and the content's label on
the target. Finer attribution inside one document is the unscheduled
[value-level provenance](../specs/cfc-value-level-provenance.md); attribution
by decomposing into documents is available today.

**`PerUser<>` keys instances, never authority.** A user-scoped cell is one
node with one value instance per principal
(`docs/specs/server-side-execution/scopes.md` §1). Who a run acts as is the
demanding identity, never the service identity; a run with no acting user
that touches user-scoped data is a runtime error, not a fallback. There is no
"list all users" primitive
([`shared-profile-rosters.md`](../specs/shared-profile-rosters.md)); a group is
expressed as a confidentiality clause `{anyOf:[User(A),User(B),User(C)]}`, and a
ceiling clause of that form admits only data every listed reader may see
(`atomsOutsideCeiling`, the quantifier note).

**Two designs already carry the queue's state machine and outcome shape.**
[Hosted pattern authoring](../specs/hosted-pattern-authoring.md) defines a
principal-scoped session with `queued → working → verifying → publishing →
succeeded | failed | cancelled`, an append-only event stream, idempotent
creation by caller-supplied operation id, admission limits without client
retry loops, and reads restricted to the creating principal plus a CFC check
on the record. [Scheduled work in the server](scheduled-work-in-the-server.md)
Part 3 states what compute accounting owes: durable state rather than
telemetry, attribution to an instance and an owner rather than a pattern name,
and enforcement at admission rather than mid-work. Neither is built, and this
design is likely to supersede hosted authoring: a coding session that revises a
piece is one agent request among others, and the harness's `pattern-author`
profile already does the authoring.

**Loom's own queue is prior art, not substrate.** Wishes are markdown blocks
with a lease, a lane lock, bounded stale-claim retries, per-class USD budgets,
and a rate-card cost computed from captured tokens because `cf-harness` reports
no provider cost (loom `src/lib/wish-store.ts`, `dispatch.ts`,
`weaver-accounting.ts`). Two of its decisions transfer: a queued item is never
painted as failed for being slow, and charged cost carries a provenance tag
(`actual | token-rate-card | estimated-budget-fallback`). Its storage does not.

**The deployment is two toolsheds.** Loom runs with a local toolshed on the
user's machine and a shared cloud toolshed; the user's home space lives on the
cloud one. A pattern may be hosted on either. The local host is reachable from
the cloud over the tailnet today, and the direction of travel is cloud first.
Section 1.7 designs around this rather than assuming one host.

## Part 1 — An agent request from a pattern

### 1.1 The pattern surface

Three shapes were considered.

**A. A new effectful builtin, `agent(...)`, in the same class as `llm`.**
The pattern writes one node; the runtime stages a sink request, gates it at
the commit boundary, hands it to the executor after commit, and settles the
result cell when the run finishes. Memoization by request hash is free;
abandonment settles the pending flag the way every class-2 builtin does; the
node re-runs when its inputs change and not otherwise.

**B. A verb on a system piece.** The pattern sends an event to a queue piece's
`submit` stream, naming a cell the runner should write into. No new builtin,
and the queue exists from the first line. But the sink check moves out of the
commit boundary into the service, the "write here" cell is a capability handed
across a space boundary, and the pattern has to build its own pending state.

**C. The existing `generateObject` with Loom tools.** The llm builtins already
call pattern and handler tools. But a tool the model calls from inside a
builtin runs in the runtime, and `loom search` is a host CLI behind a broker
the runtime does not hold. There is also no harness: no handles, no run
report, no sandbox, no structured-result sanitization.

**Ruled: A**, with the queue of Part 2 as *what the post-commit effect
enqueues into* rather than an immediate dispatch. That is the one change from
the `llm` shape, and it is why the two parts are designed together: the
builtin is the sink and the memo, the `AgentRun` record is the durable
handoff, the runner is the effect's other half.

The surface, as a pattern author sees it:

```text
// Shown for illustration only.
const recommendation = agent({
  task: "Which books this reader has finished would suit someone who " +
        "likes the four listed authors? Return up to five.",
  inputs: { finished: booksRead, likes: favoriteAuthors },
  resultSchema: RecommendationList,
  maxConfidentiality: undefined,   // default: the requester's own view
  tools: ["loom_search", "loom_page_read"],
});
// recommendation: { pending, result?, error?, requestHash, run }
```

`task` is context, not a direct command (AH-INV-3; the harness's prompt-slot
roles). `inputs` are cells, not values: the builtin passes their links, and
the model receives tokens. `resultSchema` is the harness's structured-result
schema. `tools` selects from an allowlist the deployment publishes; a name no
registered runner offers fails before the first model request (AH-INV-4).
`run` is a link to the `AgentRun` record of Part 2, so a pattern that wants to
show progress or cost reads it like any other cell.

Registration follows `generateObject`: a `raw()` module with no effect bit,
scheduled as a computation, effectful through the outbox. It takes a row in
[`builtins.md`](../specs/server-side-execution/builtins.md) §2 — server-only,
never speculated, memo key from the resolved request — and a row in the
replayability table beside its siblings.

### 1.2 Inputs are handles

The builtin serializes each input as a link, the way `--input-cell name=link`
does, and never as a value. This is the calling convention the harness is
built around: a prompt that never holds a literal cannot inline one by
accident, and cannot pass one on. What the request carries to the sink is
therefore *references plus the task text*, and only the task text is a value
the sink gate has to measure. A pattern that interpolates labeled data into
`task` has put a value into the request, and the sink gate will treat it as
one; the authoring guidance says to pass the cell instead.

Inside the run, the input names are the ones the pattern used (`finished`,
`likes`), constrained to the harness's `HANDLE_NAME_PATTERN`. The model asks
`describe_handle` what a token holds — shape and label atom types — and reads
values only through `run_pattern` over the handle or through the Loom tools,
both of which are mediated observations.

### 1.3 The harness writes the result

The harness is what knows what the model observed and what each handle in the
answer stands for, so the harness writes the result into the fabric itself,
from its host-side session, and hands back a link. Nothing downstream
re-labels, re-validates, or re-interprets it. The result therefore carries
labels at the granularity of the documents it is written as, and the rule for
how many documents that is follows.

**Validation.** The model's structured result is validated against
`resultSchema`. `asCell` in that schema keeps the meaning it has: it marks a
position that accepts an opaque reference — including one to content above the
run's ceiling — so such a position is exempt from value validation, and the
marker is a validation vocabulary rather than a placement rule for links. The
schema-opaque-link sanitizer's string-sealing pass is not run: it withholds
every free string a schema does not enumerate, which is the rule for a value
leaving the fabric toward a model and not for text a model authored on its way
in.

**Every handle the result references becomes a link.** Wherever the result
names a handle the run holds — as a token, as the canonical link string the
inbound swap produces, or as a `{"@link": …}` object, at an `asCell` position
or not — the host writes a link in its place. A handle to a cell becomes a
link to that cell, so the consumer's read resolves the cell's own label. A
handle to a referent that is not a cell — a Loom search hit, a Page read, a
SQLite row — becomes a new document holding that content, declared with the
referent's label as the tool reported it, and a link to that document. A
handle the run does not hold, anywhere in the result — a whole position, a
token inside prose, a property name — does not resolve, and the result fails
before anything is written rather than carrying an address the model composed
(AH-REF-2). A held handle in a property name stays the text it is, since a
name cannot hold a link. A handle whose cell lies outside the session's space is refused
too: the session's authority ends at its space. A recommendation list is then
five links to five book cells and a short model-authored rationale per link.

**A position's own ceiling.** Where the result schema declares
`ifc.maxConfidentiality` at a position, the writer measures the referent placed
there against it — every declaration reaching the position through `allOf`
met into one — and seals the position with an opaque link where the referent's
label does not fit. The declaration is then stripped from the schema the write
goes through, because the runtime applies a position's `maxConfidentiality` to
the whole transaction's join, which for this transaction is everything the run
observed.

**Two transactions.** The documents minted for non-cell referents are written
first, in a transaction that reads nothing, so each carries its declared label
alone. The result transaction then reads every one of them beside every cell
the run observed, and writes the result.

**What stays inline is labeled with the join.** Model-authored scalars — the
rationales, a summary — stay in the result document. Their confidentiality is
the join of what the model observed, and the writing transaction *derives*
that join rather than asserting it: before the write, the host reads every
cell the run observed (it holds their handles) and every document it minted,
so the transaction's consumed set is the real one and `deriveFlowJoin` stamps
it. The run's observation ceiling is declared on every node of the schema the
result is written through, as the result document's store policy — and on
every document a nested object splits into — so the commit boundary measures
the derived join against the ceiling and refuses a join it does not admit.
Nothing in this path hands the runtime a label it has to trust from outside a
transaction: the declaration is a ceiling the runtime checks, and the label the
document carries is the ceiling joined with what the transaction derived.

**`LlmDerived`.** The host sets the transaction's implementation identity to
the `agent` builtin before the write (`setCfcImplementationIdentity`), so the
result carries the runtime-minted integrity family a pattern cannot forge.
The host is trusted code; this is the same line the llm builtins stand on.

**Cost of this route.** The harness gains one host-side routine — a result
writer over its fabric session (`packages/cf-harness/src/result-writer.ts`,
`writeAgentResult`) that resolves handles to links, mints documents for
non-cell referents, reads observed cells, and writes under the builtin
identity — and no new model-facing tool. Against the alternative of
the builtin stamping a label the runner reported, this removes the one trusted
label input the earlier draft needed and gives per-referent labels for free.
It is the cheaper design once the harness is writing anyway, and the harness
already writes.

**What the builtin's result cell holds.** `result` is a link to the result
document the harness wrote; `pending` and `error` derive from the `AgentRun`
record's state (section 2.3). The builtin's own cell never holds a copy of the
answer, so the single-deriver rule is undisturbed: the server derives the
builtin cell from the record, and the harness's writes are authored writes to
documents it created.

### 1.4 Confidentiality: three gates and one ceiling

The design has three points where labels are measured, and one caller-facing
knob.

**Gate 1 — the request, at the commit boundary.** `agent` is a row in
`KNOWN_SINKS` with its own sink class (`agent`, not the hardcoded `network`
the other sinks mint; giving the llm sinks a class of their own is stage 2 of
[llm-sink admission](cfc-llm-sink-admission.md), and the class table this sink
introduced is where that happens). Its ceiling under the max-enforcement
posture is ruled to be *the request's observation ceiling* — this section's
knob — so that a task text may carry what the model is going to be allowed to
see and nothing more. The governance registry admits one static clause list
per sink and the gate reads nothing off the request, so what is built is a
static empty ceiling: the builtin measures its request against the pattern's
`maxConfidentiality` before staging, and the deployment's row bounds what the
staging transaction consumed. Two things follow. A request whose reads carry
no label fits, and a task text built from labeled data is refused. And a
reference is not free of label: a link position carries its target's label as
the pointer's own (`origin:"link"` entries, consumed by the `followRef` read
that resolves which reference sits at the slot), so a request passing a
labeled cell is refused with it under the static row, where the ruled ceiling
would admit a reference to the requester's own data. Reaching the ruling means
carrying the request's ceiling on the sink-request policy input, a registry
arm that declares the row per request, and every reader of
`SinkMaxConfidentiality` — the gate, `effectiveObservationCeiling`, the
posture report, the audit — taking that arm. The first take ships the static
row with the builtin-side check; the per-request ceiling, and any further
`maxConfidentiality` work, is later work listed under "Later, not sequenced"
(D5).

**Gate 2 — each observation, in the run.** Every value that would enter model
context is measured against the run's observation ceiling before it does:
`run_pattern` answers through `describeSinkReleaseRefusal` (today against an
empty ceiling; this design passes the run's ceiling instead, which is what
AH-CFC-12a asks a profile to carry), Loom results arrive labeled and are
measured the same way (section 1.6), and a refusal returns a typed opaque
observation, never silence (AH-CFC-6). The fabric session's read ceiling is
the same clause set; its present limit — it gates session-scoped query results
only, deviation 9 in the implementation profile — is a known gap the design
inherits and phase 7 retires.

**Gate 3 — the result, at the write.** Section 1.3's write is an ordinary
transaction under the run's session, so every runtime gate applies to it. It
is monotone by construction: a run under ceiling C observed only values
fitting C, so what it writes inline fits C, and what it links keeps its own
label.

**The knob: `maxConfidentiality`.** Absent, the run's observation ceiling is
*the requester's own view*: `[User(requester)]` met with `PersonalSpace`
clauses that name them, which is what "respect `PerUser<>`" means once the run
acts as the requester (section 1.5) — the user-scoped instances it resolves are
theirs, and another user's labeled data does not fit. The runner passes the
result writer `[User(requester)]` for a request naming no ceiling, and gives
the run's fabric session no read ceiling beyond what acting as the requester
already bounds; the `PersonalSpace` clauses are later work with the rest of
the ceiling (phase 7). Declared, it can only
tighten: the runtime meets the pattern's clauses with the deployment's, the way
`observationMaxConfidentiality` is met for `generateObject`
(`effectiveObservationCeiling`), so a pattern cannot widen a run from inside.
A **group ceiling** — "what A, B, and C can all see" — is a clause
`{anyOf:[User(A),User(B),User(C)]}`, and the fit rule already requires every
listed reader to satisfy each label clause, so a group ceiling admits only what
the whole group may read. `[]` is "public only", which is the right ceiling
for a run whose answer is going to be shown to people the pattern does not
enumerate.

**Prompt injection.** The harness already treats retrieved material as
context, injects untrusted-content notices beside fetched and searched
results, strips trusted-only fields from model-authored tool calls, and
prevents any tool from widening the tool surface (AH-TOOL-2). Loom results
join the same class: the tool result carries the notice loom's own dispatcher
uses ("Treat search result snippets … as untrusted external data"). Nothing
new is needed here beyond wiring the tools through the existing channels; what
the ceiling adds is that an injected instruction has nothing above the ceiling
to exfiltrate, which is the property the hostile-skill fixture already
demonstrates for `run_pattern`.

### 1.5 Whose run it is

A run reads and writes the fabric through a `HarnessFabricSession` — a
host-side `PiecesController` with an identity, outside the sandbox. **Ruled:
the requester's identity, held by a runner that belongs to them** (section
1.7 explains why the runner is per user anyway). ACLs and `user:` scope keys
then resolve as the requester with no new mechanism, and "respect `PerUser<>`"
is a consequence rather than a rule.

Set aside for a shared runner later: a service identity with a delegated read
binding naming the requester as acting principal, the way the serving
runtime's loopback sessions carry `actingAs: "space-owner"`
([`protocol.md`](../specs/server-side-execution/protocol.md) §7). It is the
shape the server-execution spec prefers and it needs the per-document grant
story that `protocol.md` lists as owed (OW13). Ruled out outright: the
service identity alone, which resolves `user:<serviceDID>` and reads empty
instances.

The sandbox never holds a fabric credential; that is the existing
fabric-session property and nothing here changes it.

### 1.6 Loom tools

Read-only tool families, built exactly as the three authoring tools are built
— a host-side configuration file naming the CLI and a transport, a cleared
environment, structured arguments on stdin, and nothing the model can change —
and named so that they do not collide with the existing `loom_*` tools, which
are about collections:

| Tool | Loom command | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `loom_search` | `loom search <query> --json [--sources] [--since/--until/--tz] [--person] [--limit] [--rank]` | `hits[]` (source, ref, title, snippet, times, score), `source_status`, `warnings`, `truncated` |
| `loom_page_discover` | `loom page discover --concise [--kind] [--limit]` | the canonical Page inventory |
| `loom_page_inspect` | `loom page inspect <target> --concise` | a Page's context, `sourceVersion`, relations, and capability descriptors |
| `loom_page_read` | `loom page read <target>` | the Page or Document source with its exact `sourceVersion` |
| `loom_people` | `loom people <query> --json [--shape summary\|card]`, lookups only — an email, phone, `handle:`, `person:`, `group:`, or `People/<Name>/about.md` path; the maintenance and group-write verbs the same positional carries are refused | canonical person resolution: identifiers, pages, recent interaction summary |
| `loom_calendar_list` | `loom calendar list --json [--from/--to \| --all]` (`YYYY-MM-DD` dates) | loom-native events from the calendar store |
| `loom_context` | `loom context where\|activity --json [--at] [--since/--until]`; `hosted` records channel coordinates and is refused | where the user is, current activity |
| `loom_profile` | `loom profile --json [--fresh]` | the user's short resolver-backed identity |

All eight are confirmed against the pinned loom checkout: read-only, JSON on
`--json`, with the argument surface the table shows and nothing else — no
routing flag (`--rpc-queue`, `--instance`, `--engine`, `--person-ref`) reaches
the model, and a value that would parse as a flag or as another verb is
refused before a process starts. Page mutation (`create`, `replace`,
`section …`, `relocate`, `trash`), calendar writes, and `wish` are out of the
first take. `--concise` is passed by the host, not offered to the model: a
full `inspect` exceeds the harness's tool-result bound and returns fragments
that do not parse, which loom's own skill notes.
[`packages/cf-harness/docs/LOOM_RETRIEVAL.md`](../../packages/cf-harness/docs/LOOM_RETRIEVAL.md)
is the implementation reference.

**Labels on Loom observations.** Loom connector rows carry `ifc` labels in
their stores, and loom's `/agent-search` honors the facet scope its broker was
launched with (`fabric_local_agent_rpc.py serve --facets`), so loom's own
filtering runs first. None of the retrieval commands takes a ceiling on argv,
so the harness carries the ceiling on its own side: the retrieval
configuration names the loom read-ceiling record a facet-scoped dispatch
writes (`readCeilingFile`, the `run-ceiling` output with `loomReadCeiling`,
`facets`, `facetSource`), the harness reads it on the host, checks its facets
against the configured ones, and meets its clause list with the run's own
ceiling. Every returned row's `ifc` label is then measured against that met
ceiling before the row enters model context (gate 2), with the same predicate
`run_pattern` uses over a disclosed label. A row above the ceiling is replaced
by a typed opaque entry; a row whose label cannot be read — no `ifc`, or a
clause that is not an atom or an `anyOf` over atoms — is refused as
`cfc_label_read_failed`, never read as public, and refused even when the run
declares no ceiling (the disclosure rule in `cfc-label-disclosure.ts`). The
admitted rows' labels join into one model-context observation, and that same
label is what the result writer stamps on a document it mints for a hit the
answer references (section 1.3).

Against the pinned loom checkout, `loom search --json` emits no `ifc` on its
hits, and the page, people, calendar, context, and profile payloads carry none
either, so every real row is withheld until loom stamps its rows (assumption
11). The tools are complete on the harness side and exercised against fixture
output that carries labels.

**The tool pins `schemaVersion: 1` on loom's search JSON** and refuses a
payload that carries any other value or none. The stamp is loom's to add, in
`render_json` (`lib/connectors/search.py`); a loom checkout without it has
every `loom_search` call refused as `schema_version_mismatch`, which is the
intended reading of an unversioned payload by its first external consumer
(assumption 11).

### 1.7 Where a run executes, across two toolsheds

`loom search` runs against one person's connectors on the machine where their
Loom instance lives; Loom is single-owner per instance. So a run that needs
Loom tools executes on the requester's machine, and the executor is per user
before any queue policy says so. The home space, and possibly the requesting
space, live on the cloud toolshed. The design handles this by making the
runner **pull**: nothing on the cloud ever has to reach the local machine.

**Ruled: a separate runner process per user, on the Loom host.** `cf agent
runner` in `packages/cli`: one long-lived process holding the user's identity,
configured with the Loom tool configuration file, the fabric API URLs of both
toolsheds, and its admission limits. It connects to the cloud toolshed as an
ordinary client over the tailnet, subscribes to the user's queue index in
their home space (section 2.2), follows each index entry to the `AgentRun`
record on whichever toolshed holds the requesting space, runs the harness
locally, and writes the result and the record's terminal fields back through
the same client sessions. Tools run where the runner is; data lives where it
lived. Set aside: running inside the toolshed process (unbounded model loops
in the process serving the storage WebSocket, and the toolshed is not where
Loom is), and using loom's wish dispatcher as the runner (a Python markdown
queue in another repository as a platform dependency; loom's daemon may
*launch* the runner, but the contract is labs').

**The home space names the runner.** One entry in the home space, written by
the runner when it starts and refreshed on every claim:

```text
// Shown for illustration only.
agentRunner (in the home space, owner-protected like the profile's inbox pointer)
  host          the runner's toolshed origin (http(s) origin, like ProfileInboxPointer.host)
  tools         the tool names this runner offers
  registeredAt, lastClaimAt
```

It is the counterpart of `ProfileInboxPointer` on the profile: public on
purpose, no secret in it, the ACL is the gate. It exists so that a pattern on
the cloud can say "no runner is registered" rather than showing a request that
queues forever, and so that the builtin can fail a request before the first
model request when it names a tool no registered runner offers. It is not how
requests are routed; routing is the pull.

**Cross-toolshed links.** An index entry, and the builtin's `run` link,
carry the record's host origin beside the link, the way the inbox pointer
carries `host` beside `space`, because a link resolves a space identity and
not the toolshed that serves it. When one toolshed serves everything the
field is redundant and harmless.

**Cloud first, later.** When Loom's data or Loom itself is served from the
cloud, the runner moves next to it and the `agentRunner` entry points there;
the pull, the record, and the builtin do not change. A cloud runner with no
Loom tools is already expressible: its `tools` list is shorter.

## Part 2 — The work queue

### 2.1 What it has to do

- Hold every agent request a user has submitted, across spaces and across the
  two toolsheds, as a durable record with a state, so that load is bounded by
  admission rather than by refusing requests.
- Be readable from inside the platform: a pattern can render a user's runs, the
  shell can list them, `cf` can list, show, and cancel them.
- Carry, on each finished run, model usage and cost.
- Be rankable later without changing a stored shape.
- Make no claim about invocations it does not hold: nothing in the tree
  enumerates verb receipts, so the records are first-class from the start
  rather than an aggregation.

### 2.2 Where the records live

Three substrates, none equivalent:

| Substrate | Durable | Pattern-readable | Server-enforceable | Exists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct-engine plane table (beside `execution_lease`) | yes | no | yes | the plane, not the table |
| Service-side session record (hosted authoring's) | yes | no | yes | no |
| Cells in the fabric | yes | yes | via the runner's reads | yes |

Inspectability from patterns is a stated requirement and only the third
substrate meets it without a new protocol, so **`AgentRun` records are
cells**. A quota the server enforces at admission wants the first substrate,
and the scheduled-work plan already proposes a per-space ledger there; that is
later work and it reads the same records.

**Ruled: records in the requesting space, indexed from the home space.** The
record is created by the request's post-commit effect, once the transaction
staging the request is durable, in the requester's `PerUser` instance, next to
the builtin cell that derives from it; the index entry follows in a second
transaction, since the home space is not the requesting space. A request with
no requesting identity to resolve a home space for is refused before it is
staged, so no record exists that no index names; a record whose index write is
refused is ended by the effect as `refused`, and the builtin derives that. The
requester's home space carries one index piece (`#agent_queue`, an underscore
because the hashtag extractor ends at a hyphen) holding `{link, host}` entries
to records across spaces and toolsheds, written through the sanctioned
`.inSpace` crossing that home-space wish bootstrap already uses. The home
default pattern holds the piece in a field of its own, `agentQueue`, and
consumers discover it with `wish({ query: "#agent_queue" })`, a well-known
home-space target that `wish` resolves to that field the way it resolves
`#journal` and `#learned`. A hashtag search does not reach it: under
`scope: ["~"]` that search reads the user's favorites and nothing else in the
home space, and the index is not a favorite, which the user could remove. The
index is the aggregation shape
[Loom resource discovery](loom-resource-discovery.md) chose for the same
problem. Set aside: a dedicated per-user queue space
pointed at from the profile, which costs a minted space per user and puts the
record and the builtin cell in different spaces.

A home space that holds no queue — no home pattern, or one from before the
field — has nowhere to list the record, so the index write fails and the
record ends `refused` like any other record the effect cannot index.
`cf agent runner` creates the home pattern on start when there is none.

### 2.3 The record

```text
// Shown for illustration only.
AgentRun (PerUser, in the requesting space)
  request        link to the agent node's cell (holds requestHash)
  requestHash
  task, inputs, resultSchema, maxConfidentiality?, tools?
                 the request as staged; inputs are links
  space, piece   where it came from — links, not names
  submittedAt
  state          queued | claimed | running | completed | failed | refused | cancelled
  stateSince
  claim?         { runner, leaseUntil }        while claimed or running
  attempts       claims made so far; runner-written, incremented by each claim
  cancelRequestedAt?  set by a client asking the run to stop; the one write
                 a client other than the runner makes
  result?        link to the result document the harness wrote
  outcome?       completed | failed | refused | cancelled
  errorCode?     one taxonomy shared with verb refusals (INVALID_INPUT, LIMIT_REACHED, …)
  startedAt?, finishedAt?
  modelTurns?, toolCalls?
  usage?         HarnessModelUsage: inputTokens, cachedInputTokens, cacheWriteTokens,
                 outputTokens, reasoningTokens, totalTokens,
                 costUsd?, estimatedCostUsd?, estimateWithheldReason?
  usageCoverage? direct | including-descendants
  runRef?        operator-only reference to the run artifact root; never a value
  priority?      absent in the first take; reserved for ranking
```

The canonical schema is `AgentRunRecordSchema` in
`packages/runner/src/builtins/agent-schemas.ts`: `packages/runner` sits below
`packages/patterns` in the layer stack and cannot import from it, so the
pattern-facing `AgentRun` type in `packages/patterns/system/agent-run.tsx`
restates the shape and `packages/runner/test/agent-schemas-parity.test.ts`
holds the two together. The error codes are one module,
`packages/runner/src/agent-error-codes.ts`.

A cancel is a durable field and not a stream on the record: a stream event
reaches only the runtime that runs its handler, and the runner is another
process. `agent-run.tsx` gives a view over a record whose `cancel` stream sets
`cancelRequestedAt`; a runner that sees the field on a record it is running
aborts the run through the harness's `signal` and ends the record `cancelled`,
and one that sees it on a `queued` record ends it without running it.

The request fields are written by the server when the request commits; the
runner writes everything from `claim` on. The two writer sets never overlap,
which is what lets a derived creation and later authored progress writes share
one record without a second deriver. The single-deriver rule admits the split:
it binds derived committers and is not an ACL on the record, an authored write
to the record is admitted under the record's ACL and CAS, and the one hazard —
a derivation later blind-writing the record over the runner's fields — does
not arise, because the effect writes the record once and the builtin only
reads it from then on (assumption 9).

The state machine is hosted authoring's with the two authoring-specific states
removed and one added:

```text
queued ──claim──▶ claimed ──start──▶ running ──▶ completed
   │                 │                  │    ├──▶ failed      (typed error)
   │                 │                  │    └──▶ refused     (CFC refusal, reason withheld)
   └──cancel─────────┴──────────────────┴──────▶ cancelled
```

`refused` is separate from `failed` because the two mean different things to
a caller: one is "fix the request", the other is "the policy would not release
what this needed", and the second withholds its reason from the pattern for
the reason the abandoned-request path already gives ("a strange bargain to
refuse the write and then hand its reason to the writer"). Terminal states are
terminal; a re-run is a new request.

**Usage and cost.** The `usage` block is the harness's own type, unchanged,
and AH-USAGE governs it: an absent counter stays absent, reported and
estimated cost are separate fields with provenance, and an aggregate cost is
omitted when any included attempt lacks compatible evidence. This is the
caller-visible half of AH-USAGE-6. Loom's rate-card fallback is not copied: a
deployment that wants a price on a run whose provider reports none configures
the harness's estimate table, and the record says `estimatedCostUsd`, not
`costUsd`. A limit that ends a run — model turns, wall time, budget — is a
`failed` outcome whose `errorCode` names the limit (AH-LIFE-4), not a
`cancelled` one.

**Idempotency.** The record's identity is the request's `requestHash`, so the
same request in the same instance yields the same record and a memo hit yields
no record at all — the request settled from the stored result. A pattern that
wants a fresh run includes an input that changes. The same identity covers a
request whose transaction committed and whose post-commit effect did not run,
because the process ended between the two: the node's next run finds the
stored `requestHash` with no record and no result, stages the request again as
`generateObject` does for a stored hash that has neither result nor error, and
the effect creates the record then. Creation is keyed by `requestHash`, so an
effect that runs twice finds the first run's record and makes no second one.

**Labels.** The request fields carry the request transaction's join. The
terminal fields are written by the runner in the same session that wrote the
result, and carry that write's label. Counts and durations are low-risk on
their own, but a record says which run touched what, and
[label-metadata confidentiality](../specs/cfc-label-metadata-confidentiality.md)
is the review that would say whether they may be labeled lower than the
result. Until it does, they fail closed to the result's label.

### 2.4 Claiming and load

The runner subscribes to the user's index, claims the oldest `queued` record
it may run, and runs it. The claim is a commit: `state: claimed`,
`claim.runner`, `claim.leaseUntil`, and `attempts` incremented. Two runners racing for one record
conflict on the basis and one loses, which is the transaction system's
ordinary answer and needs no lock.

**Concurrency, first take.** One running record per user; a global cap per
runner process from its configuration. Admission happens at claim time, so an
over-cap runner simply does not claim, and a queued record stays queued and
visible with its position. Nothing polls: the runner wakes on index change,
the way a detached `cf piece call` subscribes to its receipt rather than
polling.

**Crash recovery.** A lease is the honest tool here: a runner that dies
after its claim commits leaves a `claimed` or `running` record with a
`leaseUntil` in the past — `claimed` when it died before the run started — and
the next runner to see either re-queues it once. The bound is the record's
`attempts` count, which every claim increments in the same commit: an expired
record with `attempts` of one goes back to `queued`, and one with `attempts`
of two is failed (AH-LIFE-5: bounded, visible, and only where replay is safe —
a run that had not yet started a side effect). The lease is
renewed on every durable write the run makes, so it measures silence rather
than time since start — the trap
[`docs/features/fetch-request-deadlines.md`](../features/fetch-request-deadlines.md)
records for a claim that stamps `lastActivity` once.

**Ranking, later.** `priority` is reserved and absent; claim order is
`submittedAt`. Round-robin across users is the runner's business when one
runner serves several, and the first take has one runner per user.

**Quota, later.** Per-user budgets over a window need the durable ledger the
scheduled-work plan describes. The record's `usage` is what such a ledger
sums; nothing in the first take depends on it.

### 2.5 Inspection surfaces

- **`cf agent ls [--state …]`, `cf agent show <run>`, `cf agent cancel <run>`**
  in `packages/cli`, over the home index. Described in the package README
  because `deno task check-command-docs` requires it, and given completion
  candidates because `check-completion-slots` does.
- **A Home tab**, "Agent runs": a pattern over
  `wish({ query: "#agent_queue" })` rendering state, age, and usage per record, with a cancel
  action and a "no runner registered" notice read from `agentRunner`. The
  same pattern is what a third-party space embeds if it wants to show its own
  runs.
- **The record itself**, readable with `cf cell get` like anything else.

## Phases

[The implementation plan](agent-requests-implementation.md) sequences these
as stages with files, tests, and gates; read it for order and this section
for what each phase is for. Each phase lands on its own and is testable without an LLM provider: the
harness has a scripted model client (`packages/cf-harness/test/research.test.ts`,
`ScriptedModelClient`), and the runner's admission and settlement are
exercised with a fake executor the way hosted authoring's stage 1 prescribes.

**Phase 1 — Loom retrieval tools in the harness. Built.** The tools of
section 1.6 over a `HarnessLoomRetrievalConfig` beside the authoring one, each
command's arguments and JSON shape confirmed against the pinned loom checkout;
the run's ceiling met with the loom read-ceiling record on the host; label
measurement on returned rows; the untrusted-content notice; a pinned
`schemaVersion` on loom's search JSON. Capability description lists the tools.
A scripted model over fixture output gets a search and a people lookup
returned, an unlabeled row is refused, and the transcript shows the tools'
calls. `packages/cf-harness/docs/LOOM_RETRIEVAL.md` is the reference, and
`IMPLEMENTATION_PROFILE.md` lists the tools. What the phase rests on from the
loom side — `ifc` on returned rows and the `schemaVersion` stamp — is
assumption 11.

**Phase 2 — The result writer in the harness.** The host-side routine of
section 1.3: validate, resolve handles to links, mint labeled documents for
non-cell referents, touch observed cells, write under the builtin identity,
return a link. *Acceptance:* with a scripted model over fixture cells of two
labels and one Loom hit, the written result is one document carrying the join
inline and three links whose targets carry their own labels; a handle the run
does not hold fails the write.

**Phase 3 — The `agent` builtin.** Sink row and class, governance row, the
builtin cell deriving `pending`, `result`, `error` from the record, request
staging, memo, abandonment, and the `agentRunner` tool check.
*Acceptance:* under max enforcement a request whose task text carries a
`User(other)` clause is refused at the boundary and the record settles
`refused`; a request passing cells fits; a request naming an unoffered tool
fails before any run; the pinned ungated-llm tests are untouched. Documents:
`builtins.md` §2 row, `sink-inventory.ts` JSDoc, `EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS.md` if
the builtin ships behind a flag.

**Phase 4 — Records, index, runner.** The `AgentRun` shape and its
transactional creation, the home index piece and `agentRunner` entry, and `cf
agent runner`: connect to both toolsheds, register, claim, lease, build a
`HarnessSessionConfig` with input handles and the observation ceiling, run,
write the terminal fields through the phase-2 writer's session. *Acceptance:*
with a fake executor, a record moves through every state across two test
toolsheds; a killed runner's record is re-queued once and then failed; two
runners racing claim once; the memo hit creates no record.

**Phase 5 — Inspection.** `cf agent ls/show/cancel`, the Home tab pattern,
completion candidates, command docs. *Acceptance:* the `check-command-docs`
and `check-completion-slots` gates pass, and a pattern test renders a queue of
three records with one finished run's usage and one "no runner" notice.

**Phase 6 — The demonstration.** A `book-recommendations` pattern in
`packages/patterns` whose result is five links and five rationales, run end
to end against a Loom fixture, with a CFC inspection showing the result's join
and the links' target labels. This is the owner's example and the exit
criterion for the first take.

**Phase 7 — Ceilings that hold.** Retire deviation 9 (the read ceiling reaches
the cell read path, so a labeled cell outside it reads as withheld) and
deviation 8 / CT-2217 (a delegated child carries the parent's ceiling), so
that gate 2 is enforced by the runtime rather than by the harness's
observation bookkeeping alone. Group ceilings are tested here. Until then, the
observation ceiling is enforced at the tools (gate 2 as the harness implements
it) and the fabric session's read ceiling is published as observe-grade for
space-scoped reads — a reduced-assurance deviation with an owner and a
retirement condition, as AH-CFC-15 requires.

**Later, not sequenced:** the per-request `agent` sink ceiling — the gate
reading the request's observation ceiling in place of the static row, so that
a reference to the requester's own labeled data fits under max enforcement
(§1.4, D5) — and any further `maxConfidentiality` work; ranking; the durable
ledger and per-user budgets;
Page and calendar mutation tools; a shared runner with delegated identity;
folding hosted pattern authoring into an agent request with the
`pattern-author` profile.

## Decisions

Ruled 2026-09-18 unless marked.

| # | Decision | Ruling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Pattern surface | a class-2 builtin `agent` (§1.1 A) |
| D2 | Result labeling | the harness writes the result: every referenced handle becomes a link, non-cell referents become labeled documents, inline text carries the derived join (§1.3) |
| D3 | How the join is established | derived by the writing transaction reading the observed cells and the minted referent documents, not asserted by the runner; the run's ceiling is declared as the result's store policy and the runtime measures the derived join against it; no trusted label input |
| D4 | Default observation ceiling | the requester's own view |
| D5 | `agent` sink ceiling under max enforcement | the first take ships a static empty ceiling with the builtin-side check; the request's observation ceiling as a per-request sink ceiling is later work (ruled 2026-09-18). Built as a static empty ceiling (`agent: { ceiling: [] }`), because the governance registry admits one clause list per sink and the gate reads nothing off the request. The builtin measures its request against the pattern's `maxConfidentiality` before staging. Under the static row a reference to a labeled cell is refused with the task text, since a link position carries its target's label as the pointer's own; the ruled ceiling needs the sink-request policy input to carry the request's ceiling, a registry arm declaring the row per request, and every reader of `SinkMaxConfidentiality` taking that arm (§1.4, gate 1) |
| D6 | Run identity | the requester's, held by their runner |
| D7 | Runner placement | a separate process per user on the Loom host, pulling from the cloud home space (§1.7) |
| D8 | Record location | requesting space, indexed from home with `{link, host}` entries |
| D9 | Label on terminal fields | fails closed to the result's label pending the metadata review |
| D10 | `refused` distinct from `failed` | yes |
| D11 | Crash recovery | one lease-expiry requeue, then fail |
| D12 | Naming | one record, `AgentRun`, holding state and terminal fields; no separate receipt |
| D13 | Hosted pattern authoring | likely superseded by an agent request with the `pattern-author` profile; noted at the top of its spec and plan, no work started (open) |

## Assumptions made

Listed so they can be overturned before phase 1.

1. **The runner reaches both toolsheds as a client.** The local runner
   connects to the cloud toolshed over the tailnet with the user's identity;
   nothing on the cloud connects back. A cloud-hosted pattern whose user has
   no registered runner sees "no runner" and its request waits. The owner's
   note on this ended mid-sentence; the `agentRunner` home-space entry is the
   "entry in the home space that points" it asked for, read as pointing at
   the runner rather than routing to it.
2. **One user, one runner, for now.** Cross-user fairness and a shared runner
   are later work; the record and index shapes do not preclude them.
3. **The harness's two providers are enough.** The harness speaks the
   OpenAI-compatible gateway (the toolshed) and Codex subscription auth; no
   Anthropic provider exists in the package and none is added here. Which
   provider a deployment's runner uses is the runner's configuration.
4. **The read ceiling's present limit is acceptable for a first take** when
   published as a deviation (phase 7). If it is not, phase 7 moves ahead of
   phase 4.
5. **Nothing depends on invocation records or `AgentActor`.** Both are gated
   on a CFC review that has not happened. Records are authored, and the run's
   provenance is the `LlmDerived` stamp plus the join; when `AgentActor`
   exists, the result write is where it would be minted.
6. **A minute-scale run is fine as a post-commit effect.** The outbox already
   carries llm calls of unbounded provider latency; the difference is
   duration, and the record is what makes that duration visible.
7. **The book use case is representative.** Read-only retrieval, a structured
   answer, links back to sources. A use case that needs the agent to write to
   the fabric beyond its result documents and its record is a different
   authority story and is out of scope.
8. **`PerUser<>` is honored by acting as the user**, not by a new mechanism.
9. **A split-writer record is admissible.** Server-derived request fields and
   runner-authored progress fields on one document (§2.3). Settled by reading
   the spec: the single-deriver invariant binds derived committers and is not
   an ACL on a derived document — an authored write into one is admitted
   under the target's ACL and CAS (`scenario-traces.md` T12.Q4,
   `serving-loop.md` §3d) — and what it leaves open is a blind-writing
   derivation later clobbering the authored fields, which cannot happen to
   a record the effect writes once and the builtin thereafter only reads.
   The sibling-document fallback is not needed. The executable check is
   `packages/runner/test/agent-split-writer.test.ts`: a second client session
   writes the runner's fields into a record the effect created, the commits
   land, both writers' fields stand, and the builtin derives from them. It
   runs with client runtimes on one memory server; under a serving runtime
   the split rests on the spec reading above.
10. **Minting a document for a Loom hit is an authored write the runtime
    admits with a declared label.** The label comes from loom's `ifc` on the
    row; a row without one is refused before it reaches the model, so none
    reaches the writer.
11. **Loom will stamp `ifc` on the rows its retrieval commands return, and
    `schemaVersion: 1` on its search JSON.** Today `loom search --json`
    carries neither: a search is refused as `schema_version_mismatch`, and
    with the stamp in place its `hits[]` carry no `ifc`, as the page, people,
    calendar, context, and profile payloads carry none, so the harness
    withholds every real row as `cfc_label_read_failed` (section 1.6). The first take's demonstration (phase 6) rests on loom emitting the
    label its stores already hold for each row; until then the tools answer
    only fixture output. If loom does not, the alternative is a
    host-configured label for loom-native payloads, which is a new trust
    decision and gets its own ruling.

## Alternatives considered and set aside

- **Extend `llmDialog` with tool calls into Loom.** Loom is a host CLI behind a
  broker; the runtime does not hold it, and the harness's handle discipline
  and run evidence would be lost.
- **Have the builtin stamp a label the runner reports.** The earlier draft;
  replaced by D2 and D3, which need no trusted label input.
- **Place links only at `asCell` positions.** `asCell` is validation
  vocabulary for accepting an opaque reference; links go wherever the result
  references a handle, which is a superset.
- **Store records on the direct-engine plane only.** Invisible to patterns,
  which was the requirement.
- **Copy loom's wish store.** Markdown blocks under a file lock in another
  repository; the platform's transactions already give atomic claims.
- **Compute cost from a rate card in the platform.** The harness already
  separates reported from estimated cost with provenance; adding a second
  estimator with a second table is the thing AH-USAGE-4 exists to prevent.
- **Route requests from the cloud to the local machine.** Replaced by the
  pull in §1.7; the tailnet is then needed in one direction only.

## Out of scope

Page and calendar mutation through the agent. Writes to the fabric other than
the result documents and the record. Cross-user runs and a shared runner.
Ranking and quotas beyond the reserved field and the usage a ledger would sum.
Any guarantee while the requester's runner is offline: records queue and stay
visible. Sub-user (per-session) queues.

## Documents this changes when it lands

- [`../specs/server-side-execution/builtins.md`](../specs/server-side-execution/builtins.md)
  §2 — the `agent` row.
- `packages/runner/src/cfc/sink-inventory.ts` and `runtime-presets.ts` — the
  sink, its class, and its governance row; the CFC audit goldens that list
  sinks.
- [`cfc-llm-sink-admission.md`](cfc-llm-sink-admission.md) — stage 2's "an llm
  sink class" is shared machinery once `agent` mints a class of its own.
- `packages/cf-harness/docs/LOOM_AUTHORING.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PROFILE.md`,
  `CURRENT_STATE.md` — the retrieval tools, the result writer, and the
  published deviation.
- `packages/cli/README.md` — `cf agent …`.
- [`../development/EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS.md`](../development/EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS.md)
  — if the builtin or the runner ships behind a flag.
- [`../common/README.md`](../common/README.md) — a pattern-author page for
  `agent(...)` once phase 3 lands.
- [`../specs/hosted-pattern-authoring.md`](../specs/hosted-pattern-authoring.md)
  and [`hosted-pattern-authoring.md`](hosted-pattern-authoring.md) — archived
  or rewritten as an agent-request profile when D13 is ruled.
- This document is archived to `docs/history/plans/` when phase 6 lands;
  phase 7 continues under the implementation profile's deviation list.
