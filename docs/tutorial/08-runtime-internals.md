# Chapter 8 — The Reactive Runtime

Chapter 7 ended with a frozen graph object. This chapter is about the
machine that runs it: what a `Cell` really is, how the scheduler decides
what to re-execute, and how writes become transactions. This is the heart of
the system — `packages/runner` (with public types in `packages/api`).

## What a Cell actually is

A `Cell` (`packages/runner/src/cell.ts`) holds no data. It is a **typed
pointer plus a transaction context**:

```
Cell = {
  link: { space, id, path, schema },   // a NormalizedLink — WHERE and WHAT SHAPE
  tx,                                  // which transaction reads/writes go through
  ...                                  // kind: cell | stream | readonly | ...
}
```

- `space` — the DID of the space the document lives in.
- `id` — the entity id (an `of:fid1:<hash>` URI) of the document.
- `path` — a property path *within* the document (`["items", 2, "title"]`).
- `schema` — the JSON schema (from Chapter 7) describing what's expected at
  that path — including `asCell`/`default`/`scope` annotations.

Every cell operation is now obvious from the shape: `.key("title")` returns
a sibling cell with one more path segment and the narrowed schema.
`.asSchema()` reinterprets the same location under a different schema.
`.get()` resolves the link against the local replica of the space *through
the current transaction*. Path-granular reactivity (Chapter 2) falls out:
dependencies are recorded as (space, id, path) addresses, so writing
`item.done` doesn't disturb readers of `item.title`.

Entity ids are content-derived: `createRef(source, cause)` hashes the
creation context (`packages/runner/src/create-ref.ts`), so the "same" cell
created by the same graph node gets the same id deterministically — which is
what lets a server re-instantiate a piece and arrive at the same cells.

**Links between documents** are stored as serializable references (sigil
links: `{ "/": { "link@1": { id, path, space } } }`; the modern cell
representation holds these as atomic `FabricLink` values that serialize to
that envelope). When a read encounters
one, it resolves through to the target — transparently crossing documents
and even spaces. This is the mechanism behind `cf piece link` (Chapter 5).
Writes are subtler, and worth stating precisely: a write whose path
continues *past* a link (`selected.key("title").set(...)`) follows the link
and lands on the target, as does a write through a *write-redirect* link
(the kind pattern argument/output bindings use) — but writing a plain value
at the exact location of an ordinary link simply **replaces the link**.
This asymmetry is what makes the "selection" gotcha (Chapter 6, #7)
confusing in practice, and why the rule there is to box stored references.

## The scheduler: reads are subscriptions, literally

The runtime's event loop is the scheduler
(`packages/runner/src/scheduler.ts`). Every graph node — each `computed`,
`lift`, handler, render binding — is an **action**. The cycle:

1. **Run inside a transaction.** Each action executes with a fresh
   transaction whose journal records every (space, id, path) it read — the
   *reactivity log*. No annotations needed; reading through the transaction
   is what subscribes you.
2. **Commit.** The transaction's writes are applied (next section).
3. **Re-subscribe.** The action's actual read-set replaces its old one. The
   scheduler maintains a reverse index — "this (space, id, path) is read by these
   actions" — so dependencies follow the data the action *really* touched
   this run, branch by branch.
4. **React.** When any write lands (locally, or arriving from the server —
   the scheduler doesn't care), the index marks the affected actions dirty
   and queues them.

Execution is **demand-driven and lazy** (`scheduler/settle.ts`,
`scheduler/dependency-graph.ts`, and `scheduler/work-oracle.ts`): only
computations that something observable (a UI sink, an effect, an explicit
`.pull()`, or an event preflight) depends on get re-run, so an
unobserved derived value costs nothing. (An eager "push" mode existed
historically; it was removed in the scheduler-v2 rebuild — pull is now the
only strategy.)

Cycles and pathologies are contained by per-pass iteration and per-node run
budgets. A non-converging subgraph is deferred behind an escalating backoff
gate while unrelated work continues; it cannot spin the runtime indefinitely.
The scheduler emits one `Reactive graph did not settle` warning per episode,
including the deferred action names and a pointer to
`commonfabric.detectNonIdempotent()`.

The dirtying machinery is also why *remote* changes feel local: a synced
update from another user lands in the replica as a write notification, hits
the same trigger index, and re-runs the same actions. The pattern code
cannot tell the difference.

## Transactions: atomicity and optimism

Every action runs in an `IExtendedStorageTransaction`
(`packages/runner/src/storage/`):

- **Reads** go through the transaction so they (a) see a consistent
  snapshot plus the transaction's own pending writes, and (b) get journaled
  for reactivity and conflict detection.
- **Writes** are buffered in the journal, not applied. A transaction may
  write to **one space** (reads may span spaces).
- **Commit** applies the writes to the local replica *optimistically* —
  subscribers re-run immediately — and ships them to the server
  asynchronously (Chapter 9).

If the server later rejects the commit (someone else won a race), the
replica rolls the optimistic writes back, emits a `revert` notification
(dependents re-run with the restored state), and the runtime retries the
action against fresh data (`Runtime.editWithRetry`; the scheduler retries
reactive actions a bounded number of times). This is the mechanism behind
the Part I promise "optimistic but converge; you may see a write lose and
re-apply."

Not every write takes that compare-and-swap path, though. **Mergeable**
operations (Chapter 2 — `push`, `addUnique`, `increment`, `removeByValue`)
commit the *intent* of the write and drop their own incidental read of the
container from the conflict set, so concurrent appends or increments merge
on the server instead of conflicting
(`packages/runner/src/storage/mergeable-ops.ts`). And plain scalar sets —
notably the writes two-way UI bindings issue — are **blind**: their reads
are recorded for reactivity but excluded from commit preconditions, making
them last-write-wins. Revert-and-retry is the story for read-modify-write
commits.

Note the layering discipline: the scheduler only knows "transactions commit
or conflict"; *how* conflicts are detected is entirely the storage layer's
business (Chapter 9). That separation is what lets the same runtime run
against an in-process store (tests, CLI) or a remote server, unchanged.

## Executing a pattern graph

Instantiating a piece (`packages/runner/src/runner.ts` and `builder/`) ties
the previous three sections together:

1. The pattern's `argumentSchema` is applied to the argument cell — this is
   where `default:` values materialize and `asCell` decides whether a node
   receives a value or a writable handle.
2. Each `Node` in the graph becomes a scheduled action: `javascript` nodes
   (lifts/computeds/handlers) wrap their compiled implementation (resolved
   via the `$implRef` executable registry) and run in the SES sandbox;
   `pattern` nodes recurse into sub-patterns; `ref`/`raw`/`passthrough`
   cover builtins and plumbing. (An `isolated` module type is declared in
   the API but not currently implemented by the runner.)
3. Handler nodes register as **stream** consumers: nothing runs until
   something `.send()`s to the stream; then the handler executes as a
   one-shot action with the event as input, in its own transaction.
4. The `result` tree is written so the piece's result cell contains links to
   the right internal cells — which is why other pieces can link to a
   piece's outputs (Chapter 5): the outputs *are* addressable cells.

There's no diffing and no re-render pass anywhere in this story. The UI
(Chapter 11) is just one more subscriber: a VNode tree whose dynamic slots
are cells, with a renderer that patches the DOM when those cells change.

## Spaces in the runtime

The runtime's `StorageManager` opens one **provider per space**, each
wrapping a local **replica** (confirmed state + pending optimistic
versions per document). All cells with the same `space` share that replica;
cross-space links just mean an action's read-set spans replicas. Identity
and authorization for opening a space session are Chapter 10's subject; the
sync protocol that keeps replicas honest is next.
