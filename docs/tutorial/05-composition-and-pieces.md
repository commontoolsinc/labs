# Chapter 5 — Composition, Pieces, and Capabilities

So far we've built single programs. The point of Common Fabric, though, is
*networks* of programs: patterns composing into bigger patterns, and
deployed pieces linking to each other through shared cells. This chapter
covers composition inside one source file, the piece lifecycle, linking
across pieces, navigation, and the built-in LLM capability.

## Composing patterns in source

A pattern instantiates another pattern by calling it — as a function or as
JSX (equivalent; the runtime extracts `[UI]` from the result):

```tsx
// Shown inside a pattern body.
{items.map((item) => ItemCard({ item }))}
{items.map((item) => <ItemCard item={item} />)}
```

What gets passed down is **the cell, not a copy**. In the todo list
(Chapter 4), `TodoItemPiece` receives the `item` cell; when its checkbox
writes `item.done`, the parent's computeds see it — there is no
prop-drilling/state-lifting dance because there is no ownership boundary:
both patterns are graphs over the same cells. Streams pass the same way
(`removeItem` is sent down so the child can ask the parent to remove it).

The contract for a composable child: its `Output` must include
`[NAME]: string` and `[UI]: VNode` if the parent will render it. And the
wiring is **by exact field name** — the child's input names must match what
you pass; there is no automatic mapping.

Two cautions, both compiler-rooted (Chapter 7):

- Pattern inputs are cell proxies, so spreading them (`{...extraTools}`) is
  a silent no-op; merge inside a `computed()` instead.
- If a value passed to a child came from *another* composed pattern, bridge
  it through a local `computed()` before using it in `ifElse` (Chapter 4's
  gotcha).

Passing a plain value to a child input creates fresh state owned by that
instance; passing a cell shares state. The same `Counter` pattern can be ten
independent counters or ten views of one counter, depending only on what the
parent passes.

## Pieces: patterns, deployed

A **pattern** is source code — a template. A **piece** is an instance of a
pattern living in a space. Instantiation (via `cf piece new`, the shell, or
another piece) does roughly this (see `packages/piece/src/manager.ts`):

1. The pattern source is compiled and registered, so the space knows the
   program (not just its output).
2. An **argument cell** is created to hold the piece's inputs, and a
   **result cell** to hold what the pattern returns; metadata links the
   piece to its pattern source.
3. The piece is added to the space's piece list (the space's default
   pattern maintains `allPieces` and exposes an `addPiece` stream — note,
   even space management is "just a pattern").
4. From then on, any runtime that opens the space can load the piece: the
   pattern graph is re-instantiated over the argument cell, and the result
   (including `[UI]`) flows from there.

A piece is identified by an entity id (a hash, e.g. `fid1:abc...`) and can carry
a human **slug** for URLs. In the shell, `/{spaceName}/{pieceIdOrSlug}` shows
a piece's UI.

## Linking pieces

Because a piece's inputs and outputs are cells, you can wire *deployed*
pieces together after the fact:

```bash
deno task cf piece link <editor-piece-id>/items <viewer-piece-id>/items
```

This points the viewer's `items` input at the editor's `items` output — the
same cell-sharing as in-source composition, but done at runtime between
independently deployed programs. Under the hood it writes a **link** (a
serialized cell reference) into the viewer's argument cell; the runtime
resolves links transparently on read (Chapter 8). This is the payoff of the
whole design: integration between programs is a pointer, not an API project.

## Navigation

For drill-down flows (list → detail), a handler can return
`navigateTo(somePiece)`:

```tsx
// Shown as JSX element children.
<cf-button onClick={() => navigateTo(ItemDetail({ item }))}>Edit</cf-button>
```

`navigateTo` with a freshly-instantiated pattern creates the detail piece
and navigates the shell to it; with an existing piece it just navigates.
The canonical list/detail example is `packages/patterns/reading-list/` —
the detail pattern receives each editable field as a `Writable<>` input and
binds them directly with `$value`.

## Capability: LLM calls

Patterns can call language models declaratively — `generateText` /
`generateObject` are *reactive nodes*, not awaited promises
(`docs/common/capabilities/llm.md`):

```tsx
// Shown inside a pattern body.
const response = generateText({
  prompt: userInput,                       // reactive — re-runs when it changes
  system: "You are a helpful assistant.",
});
// response: { pending: boolean, result?: string, error?: unknown,
//             partial?: string /* streaming text so far */ }

{response.pending ? <cf-loader /> : <cf-markdown>{response.result}</cf-markdown>}
```

The request flows through the server's LLM proxy (Toolshed — Chapter 11),
results are cached per distinct input, and `pending`/`error`/`result` are
just cells your UI binds to. A real use from
`packages/patterns/shopping-list.tsx` — note it's *inside a `.map()`*, one
cached classification per item:

```tsx
// Shown inside a pattern body.
const itemsWithAisles = items.map((item) => {
  const aisleResult = generateObject<AisleResult>({
    system: "You are a grocery store assistant. ...respond with one of the exact locations...",
    prompt: `Store layout:\n${effectiveLayout}\n\nItem: ${item.title}\n...`,
    model: "anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5",
  });
  return { item, aisle: aisleResult };
});
```

Model names must be `vendor:model` (e.g. `"anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5"`,
`"openai:gpt-4o"`); a malformed name fails with an unhelpful `TypeError`.
`generateObject` accepts `cache: false` to force regeneration
(`generateText` is always cached per distinct input).

Think about what this composition means: an LLM call whose *prompt is a
reactive function of durable shared state*, whose result is durable shared
state, inside a list comprehension, synced to every user of the space. That
sentence is the product.

## Background execution

A piece can keep working with no browser open. A pattern that exposes a
`bgUpdater` stream (or registers via the `cf-updater` component) gets picked
up by the **background piece service**, which polls registered pieces (every
60 s by default) and sends to that stream server-side — same graph, same
cells, headless executor (details in Chapter 11). This is how "summarize my
feed every morning" works without anyone keeping a tab open.
