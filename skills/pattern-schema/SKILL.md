# Schema Design Phase

## Goal

Create `schemas.tsx` with all data types and Input/Output types BEFORE any
pattern code.

## Read First

- `docs/common/concepts/types-and-schemas/default.md`
- `docs/common/concepts/types-and-schemas/writable.md`
- `docs/common/concepts/pattern.md` (Input/Output section)

## Rules

1. **ALWAYS use `pattern<Input, Output>()`** - Never use single-type
   `pattern<State>()`. Single-type patterns cannot be tested via `.send()`.
2. Use `Writable<>` in an Input type only for values the pattern receives and
   intends to mutate.
3. **Output types never use `Writable<>`** - they reflect returned data shape
4. Fields that could be undefined initially: use `Default<T, value>`
5. Actions in Output type: `Stream<T>` (enables testing and linking)
6. Sub-patterns need `[NAME]: string` and `[UI]: VNode` in Output type

## Top-Level vs Sub-Pattern Inputs

Pattern Factory create-mode deliverables are usually top-level patterns. A
top-level pattern should be usable by itself with sensible defaults and should
usually own its local state unless the brief explicitly describes caller-owned
cells, linking, or embedding.

Do not create required caller-provided `Writable<>` inputs solely because the UI
edits that field. If the top-level pattern owns the state, model that ownership
in the pattern implementation and expose the user-visible shape through the
Output type.

Use caller-provided writable inputs by default for nested sub-patterns that edit
state owned by a parent pattern. Those sub-patterns also need `[NAME]` and
`[UI]` when rendered by composition.

## Template

```tsx
import { Default, NAME, Stream, UI, VNode, Writable } from "commonfabric";

// ============ DATA TYPES ============
export interface Item {
  name: Default<string, "">;
  done: Default<boolean, false>;
}

// ============ PATTERN INPUT/OUTPUT ============
export interface ItemInput {
  item: Writable<Item>; // Writable in Input = pattern will modify
}

export interface ItemOutput {
  [NAME]: string; // Required for sub-patterns
  [UI]: VNode; // Required for sub-patterns
  item: Item; // No Writable in Output
  toggle: Stream<void>; // Actions as Stream<T>
}
```

## Done When

- All data types defined with correct Writable/Default wrapping
- All Input/Output types defined for each top-level pattern or sub-pattern
- No TypeScript errors: `deno task cf check schemas.tsx --no-run`
