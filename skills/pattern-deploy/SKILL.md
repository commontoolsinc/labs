# Deploy Phase

Use the `cf` skill, or read `skills/cf/SKILL.md`, for comprehensive CLI
documentation. Use the command shapes from its Quick Command Reference rather
than guessing flags; this skill only covers the deploy workflow and exit
criteria.

## Read First

- `skills/cf/SKILL.md` — the Environment Setup section (`CF_API_URL`,
  `CF_IDENTITY`, identity key creation) is the prerequisite for every command
  below
- `docs/development/LOCAL_DEV_SERVERS.md` - Local dev setup
- `docs/common/workflows/development.md` - Workflow commands

## Find Identity Key

```bash
ls -la ./cf.key 2>/dev/null || ls -la *.key 2>/dev/null || find . -name "*.key" -maxdepth 2 2>/dev/null
```

If no key exists, create one per the cf skill
(`deno run -A packages/cli/mod.ts id new > cf.key` for a unique key — note the
cf skill's warning: never redirect `deno task cf` output into a key file, the
wrapper pollutes it with ANSI preamble). Never overwrite an existing key file —
identity-scoped data (PerUser state, favorites) becomes invisible under a new
identity.

## Commands

With `CF_API_URL` and `CF_IDENTITY` exported (see the cf skill), you can drop
`--api-url`/`--identity`; `--space` is always required.

**Check syntax without deploying:**

```bash
deno task cf check pattern.tsx --no-run
```

**Run and collect automated pattern tests:**

```bash
deno task cf test packages/patterns/[name]/main.test.tsx
```

New or changed pattern behavior must have automated coverage. Find every
authored `*.test.tsx` entry, run each one, and repeat `--test` for each entry in
the deployment commands below. Manual handler checks do not replace this step.

**Deploy new pattern (first time only):**

```bash
deno task cf piece new packages/patterns/[name]/main.tsx --test packages/patterns/[name]/main.test.tsx --identity cf.key --api-url $CF_API_URL --space <space>
# Output: Created piece bafyreia... <- SAVE this piece ID
```

**Update deployed pattern (all subsequent iterations):**

```bash
deno task cf piece setsrc packages/patterns/[name]/main.tsx --test packages/patterns/[name]/main.test.tsx --piece <ID> --identity cf.key --api-url $CF_API_URL --space <space>
```

`--piece` is required for `setsrc` — never "update" by re-running `piece new`,
which creates a duplicate piece.

`--test` packages and type-checks a test but does not run it. Every `setsrc`
defines the complete source revision, so repeat all test flags on every update
or the new revision will omit those test roots.

A pattern reads a file that is not code — a fixture, a lookup table — with
`dataFile(path)` from `commonfabric`, naming it relative to the module that
reads it. That call is the declaration, so `new`, `setsrc`, `check` and `test`
all attach the file without being told. Its bytes are stored verbatim and never
parsed, compiled, or importable; it must be UTF-8 text inside the deployment
root. Repeatable `--datafile <path>` remains for a file the source cannot name:
one read by a computed path, or one that ships with a pattern that does not read
it. The same complete-revision rule applies to those, so repeat every data-file
flag on each update too.

**Inspect piece state:**

```bash
deno task cf piece inspect --piece <ID> --identity cf.key --api-url $CF_API_URL --space <space>
```

**Test handler via CLI:**

```bash
deno task cf call --piece PIECE_ID handlerName
deno task cf piece step --piece PIECE_ID    # Required! Triggers recomputation
deno task cf piece inspect --piece PIECE_ID  # Now shows updated state
```

**Important:** Always run `piece step` after `cf call` or `cf set`. Without it,
computed values remain stale and `inspect`/`get` return old data.

## When Deploy Fails

- If `piece new` or `setsrc` errors, re-run `deno task cf check` locally first.
- Verify `CF_API_URL` is reachable (see the cf skill's troubleshooting table).
- If you accidentally ran `new` twice, remove the duplicate with
  `deno task cf piece rm --piece <ID> ...` before continuing.
- Never retry `new` to "fix" a failed `setsrc`.

## Get Help

```bash
deno task cf --help
deno task cf piece --help
```

## Done When

- Piece deploys without errors
- Every automated pattern test passes
- Every authored test entry is attached to the deployed source revision
- State inspects correctly
- Handlers respond to CLI calls
