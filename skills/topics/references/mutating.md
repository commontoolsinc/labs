# Create, update, and connect Topics

Part of `skills/topics/SKILL.md`, which is the map. This is the detail on every
write: creating a Topic and recovering its address, what a call's answer does
and does not prove, the Topic verbs, references between Topics, and the
editorial conventions every write follows.

## Create and recover the address

Mint one invocation session for the agent run. Replace every angle-bracketed
invocation placeholder below with an id unique to that logical mutation, and
reuse that id only to retry the same mutation. Create through the board and
project the returned Topic to its address:

```bash
export CF_INVOCATION_SESSION="$(deno task cf invocation-session new)"
CREATE="$(deno task cf piece call --cell "$TOPICS_BOARD" \
  --invocation '<unique-topic-create-id>' \
  addTopic \
  '{"title":"<title>","body":"<initial living document>","agentName":"Sol"}' \
  -- --schema '{"properties":{"topic":{"$link":true},"name":{"type":"string"}}}')"
TOPIC="$(printf '%s\n' "$CREATE" | jq -r '.result.topic["$link"] // empty')"
NAME="$(printf '%s\n' "$CREATE" | jq -r '.result.name // empty')"
```

The projection names BOTH results, and that is load-bearing: a schema listing
only `topic` drops `name` from the envelope, so `NAME` comes back empty and the
allocated number is lost. Dropping the projection entirely returns the name and
the whole created topic with it — a rendered view included, two orders of
magnitude more payload — which is what the projection exists to avoid.

When the result is present, carry `TOPIC` into the next command. `NAME` is the
member name the board allocated — read it here rather than from the Topic's own
`shortName`, which is a derivation that may not have produced a value when the
call returns. Use JSON encoding or schema-derived flags for multiline Markdown;
do not interpolate unescaped content into JSON.

Current Estuary calls have a known observation asymmetry. `addTopic` has
reported an error after committing and has reported success without committing.
A call can also answer nothing at all: `addTopic` and `addLink` have each hung
past a ten-minute client timeout and committed, and an `addTopic` has hung the
same way and not committed. A timeout therefore settles nothing in either
direction, and none of this is particular to `addTopic` — take it as the
behavior of every authored-content verb.

So treat every call envelope, and every absence of one, as an observation rather
than proof of durable state, and read back after every mutation. For `addTopic`,
use a distinctive title and compare the narrow board index before and after the
call; if the result is uncertain, recover its `$link` there rather than blindly
creating another Topic. Retrying on the strength of a timeout is how one Topic
becomes two.

```bash
deno task cf cell get "$TOPICS_BOARD" index --step --select @,title
deno task cf cell get --cell "$TOPIC" title --input
```

Use one invocation session per agent run and an explicit invocation id per
logical mutation. Retry an uncertain mutation only with that same session/id
pair. The full retry and receipt model is in `skills/cf/SKILL.md` and
`docs/common/verbs/over-the-cli.md`.

## Update through Topic verbs

```bash
deno task cf piece call --cell "$TOPIC" --invocation '<unique-set-title-id>' setTitle \
  '{"title":"<complete new title>","agentName":"Sol"}'
deno task cf piece call --cell "$TOPIC" --invocation '<unique-set-body-id>' setBody \
  '{"body":"<complete revised body>","agentName":"Sol"}'
deno task cf piece call --cell "$TOPIC" --invocation '<unique-add-comment-id>' addComment \
  '{"body":"<point-in-time update>","agentName":"Sol"}'
deno task cf piece call --cell "$TOPIC" --invocation '<unique-add-link-id>' addLink \
  '{"url":"<PR URL>","kind":"pr","label":"<label>","agentName":"Sol"}'
```

`kind` defaults to `web`; a blank or omitted `label` defaults to the URL.
Current authored-content verbs reject blank required content or attribution
instead of reporting apparent success.

Verify the relevant durable input after each call (`title`, `body`, `comments`,
or `links`). Use `--step` as a second check when the expected change is
computed, such as a count or board-index row.

A cross-Topic connection is a reference, not an address pasted into prose. Pass
the canonical reference in the declared reference position; the CLI turns it
into the live piece link the verb expects. Set `OTHER_TOPIC` to the `$link` from
the index row for the Topic being referenced; the row's `{"$link": …}` object
passes in that position as it was printed, too:

```bash
export OTHER_TOPIC='<canonical /of:... address from another index row>'
deno task cf piece call --cell "$TOPIC" --invocation '<unique-mention-id>' mention \
  "{\"topic\":\"$OTHER_TOPIC\"}"
deno task cf piece call --cell "$TOPIC" --invocation '<unique-unmention-id>' unmention \
  "{\"topic\":\"$OTHER_TOPIC\"}"
```

Use inline JSON for these reference events. The schema-derived `--topic` flag
parses its declared object before reference resolution and therefore rejects a
bare canonical address.

`unmention` removes every `mention`-made edge to that Topic. References created
inside the body are removed by editing the body. An `addLink` URL that resolves
to a piece also contributes to the reference graph.

## Editorial conventions

- Treat the body as the living big-picture document. Replace it whole with the
  current state while preserving meaningful context and decisions. Fabric owns
  revision history; do not duplicate it as an activity log.
- Treat comments as append-only, point-in-time progress records. Record what
  changed, what was learned or decided, and what comes next.
- Add every relevant pull request explicitly with `addLink` and `kind: "pr"`;
  mentioning a PR only in prose is not enough.
- Use references for relationships between Topics. Do not rely on pasted fids or
  prose scanning.
