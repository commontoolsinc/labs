# Topics on Estuary

Topics is the team's minimal issue tracker: a board piece holding Topic pieces
on Estuary, driven through `cf`. This file is the map. Each file under
`references/` carries the detail for one part of the work and is the thing to
read once you are doing that part. `skills/cf/SKILL.md` is the general CLI
surface; the pattern's canonical semantics are
`packages/patterns/topics/README.md`, and its verb contracts
`packages/patterns/topics/main.tsx` and `packages/patterns/topics/topic.tsx`.

## Where, and as whom

Run from inside the Labs checkout. Every command in this skill and its
references is spelled `deno task cf`, which runs that checkout's CLI from any
directory in it and needs nothing on PATH; `skills/cf/SKILL.md` covers the other
routes. Shell state rarely survives between an agent's tool calls, so set these
in the same invocation as the command that needs them:

```bash
export CF_API_URL='https://estuary.saga-castor.ts.net'
export CF_SPACE='topics-dev-476ea34f'
export TOPICS_BOARD='/of:fid1:jtdD-DSmuGrLGSt_6sJ3DS_7jmerrkKTEnW3fZV9e34'
export CF_IDENTITY="${CF_IDENTITY:-$HOME/.config/commonfabric/identity.key}"
```

The key is the team's per-user default at that path, the same one your human
user holds; an already-set `CF_IDENTITY` is the explicit override. When `cf`
reports the keyfile missing or unreadable, stop and ask the human to provision
that default or export the correct path: the check belongs to `cf`, so the shell
never touches the key. Do not search for keys, mint an agent key, use another
human's key, or use the publicly derivable `implicit trust` identity, and never
print or inspect key material; `deno task cf id did "$CF_IDENTITY"` gives the
public DID when one is needed.

Every authored-content mutation carries `agentName` in the same event: one
stable agent name, and no second signature in titles, labels, bodies, or
comments. Fabric retains the human principal behind the key; Topics stores the
agent name as content attribution. `mention` and `unmention` record only a
reference edge and take no `agentName`.

## What holds throughout

- Reading Topics starts with the projected board `index` in
  `references/reading.md`. `piece describe` documents a piece's readable fields
  and operations; `piece verbs` lists operations to call. A verb listing says
  nothing about how much readable data the piece holds.
- The running piece is authoritative. Estuary is the Topics production
  deployment and routinely trails the checkout; commit distance alone does not
  establish incompatibility or explain a failure. Discover the piece's contract
  before mutating. Its pinned pattern reference and the server commit reported
  by `/api/meta` identify different things; `references/verbs.md` covers both.
- Discovery is bounded: survey the projected `index`, expand one Topic at a
  time, and take an emitted `$link` unchanged.
- A call's envelope, or its absence, is an observation and not proof of durable
  state. One invocation session per run, one invocation id per logical mutation,
  a read-back after every write, and no retry on the strength of a timeout,
  which is how one Topic becomes two.
- The body is the living document, replaced whole; comments are append-only,
  point-in-time progress; every relevant pull request is an `addLink` with
  `kind: "pr"`; relationships between Topics are references, never pasted fids.
- Changing the board's or a Topic's pattern source is a production migration
  over team-critical data, held behind the rehearsal and authorization rules in
  `references/pattern-updates.md`.
