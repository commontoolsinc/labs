/**
 * Export every topic's authored content from a Topics space snapshot,
 * offline. The export is the restore payload `topics-restore.ts` consumes,
 * and the portable backup the content-safety plan calls for: it survives the
 * space becoming unusable, and it diffs against a later export.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   scripts/topics-export.ts <snapshot.sqlite> --out <export.json>
 *     [--topic-identity <id>]... [--board-identity <id>]
 *
 * The snapshot is a `VACUUM INTO` copy of the space store (the acquisition
 * step of docs/development/space-clone-rehearsal.md); everything here reads
 * it directly through `@commonfabric/state-inspector`, so no server is
 * involved and no subprocess is spawned per entity. With no identity flags,
 * topics are selected by verb shape — a piece whose result offers
 * `addComment`, `addLink`, and `setBody` — and the board by `addTopic`; the
 * selected pattern identities are printed so an operator can confirm them
 * against the migration manifest, and explicit flags override the inference.
 *
 * Comment and link array elements are stored as links to entities of their
 * own, so the export resolves each element. Any deeper link inside a content
 * field aborts the export: recording a reference as if it were content is
 * exactly the silent corruption this tool exists to rule out.
 *
 * The permissions in the shebang are the complete set the store read needs,
 * and the omission is as deliberate as the inclusions. Opening the snapshot
 * loads SQLite over FFI and reads its configuration from the environment, so
 * `--allow-ffi --allow-env`. The library is not shipped with `@db/sqlite`
 * either: on a cold cache `plug` fetches it at RUNTIME from the two hosts
 * named — the release URL and the target it redirects to — which is an
 * ordinary `fetch` and so wants `--allow-net`. Only `--allow-run` is absent,
 * because nothing here starts a process.
 *
 * `scripts/topics-export.test.ts` asserts this exact list, so changing it is
 * a deliberate act rather than a drift. Verify any change against an empty
 * `DENO_DIR`, never the cache this machine happens to be carrying: a warm
 * cache makes the SQLite download disappear, and with it the evidence that
 * the program ever reached the network at all.
