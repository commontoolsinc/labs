${preamble}

Please generate an extensive backstory for a fictional person. It should be clever and make winking references to the person not being real. The backstory should include things like their history, likes, family, hobbies, places they've lived, etc. Use alliteration and interesting details, similar to what Rowling or Gaiman might do.

Here are some basic background facts and references to weave in in subtle ways.
