${preamble}

I want to come up with a list of dozens of JSON files containing things that a user might want to have in their datastore. It should be a comprehensive slice of lots of different things they might operate over.

Here's an example list of a few:
* mailing_addresses.json
* social_security_number.json
* location_history.json
* favorite_media.json
* family.json
* reservations.json
* calendar.json
* email.json
* banking_transactions.json
* todo.json

Can you extend this list with a few dozen more JSON files? Output the list I gave you and extend it with additional items.

Output plaintext with one filename per line and no additional formatting or markdown.
