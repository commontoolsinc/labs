/**
 * Restore one topic's authored content from a `topics-export.ts` export,
 * against a live server — never through verbs, which stamp their own write
 * time and author and would falsify every timestamp and attribution being
 * restored. Writes land in the same piece, so identity and every crossref
 * edge survive.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   scripts/topics-restore.ts <export.json> --piece <fid>
 *     [--api-url <url>] [--space <did>] [--dry-run]
 *     [--allow-identity-mismatch]
 *
 * CF_API_URL and CF_IDENTITY are honored as everywhere else; --space
 * defaults to the DID recorded in the export. Every write is read back and
 * compared against the export before the script will exit zero.
 *
 * The restore is whole-topic by construction: `cf piece apply` REPLACES the
 * piece's input document (measured, not assumed — a partial apply zeroes
 * every field it omits), and no narrower CLI write path exists today, since
 * both sides of `cf cell set` validate the untouched remainder of the document
 * and refuse it — the input side judges the stored `mentionable` link
 * against its declared array type unresolved, and the result side demands
 * session-scoped fields no other session can see. So the script applies the
 * complete document in one call — built from the export's RAW argument, so
 * a plain authored field no field list here names still rides the restore —
 * then re-establishes every wiring link a document write cannot carry
 * (`$link` values are refused by the same validation), using
 * `cf piece link` against the board recorded in the export.
 *
 * Those wiring links are `STRUCTURAL_LINK_SOURCES`, which maps each one to
 * the board path it points at: `mentionable` to the board's `topics`,
 * `boardCrossrefs` to its `crossrefs`, and `boardNames` to its `namesTable`.
 * A link-valued field absent from that map stops the restore rather than
 * being guessed at, so a wiring input added to the topic pattern announces
 * itself here.
 *
 * Four honest costs. Comment and link elements are re-written as plain
 * values, so their element entities are minted fresh: content, order,
 * timestamps, and attribution are exact, but a stored reference to an
 * individual old element is not preserved. A re-established link targets the
 * board's RESULT path where the original targeted its argument document —
 * aliases of one another (#5632), so a before/after diff of the stored link
 * differs while resolution does not. The deprecated `myName` legacy link is
 * not restored — it exists only as the pre-agentName attribution fallback.
 * And a field the CURRENT schema retired is written but cannot be read back,
 * so it is reported `not restored` and does not fail the run; only a field
 * the schema still declares can be checked, and there a difference is still a
 * failure.
 *
 * The target's deployed pattern identity must match the export row's;
 * --allow-identity-mismatch overrides, which a restore after a deliberate
 * migration needs — the migration changed the identity on purpose.
