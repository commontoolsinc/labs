// deno-lint-ignore-file no-explicit-any cf-imports/no-inline-module-import --
// The point of this file is to load the SAME modules from two checkouts whose
// types differ, and where a member may not even be spelled the same in both.
// Typing the dynamic imports to either tree defeats the comparison, and only a
// dynamic import can name a module by a path built from CF_ROOT. The two
// imports that do name a module outright are ordered too: the logger names are
// claimed before anything else can construct one disabled.

/**
 * A/B harness: runs the same probes against two checkouts and diffs the
 * output, so a change to serialization can be judged by what it writes rather
 * than by whether the suite is green.
 *
 * Usage (one tree at a time; diff the two outputs):
 *
 *   CF_ROOT=<worktree> deno run --allow-all --config <worktree>/deno.jsonc ab-harness.ts [probe...]
 *
 * Probes: `encoded` (the bytes a pattern reaches storage as), `liveness`
 * (functions surviving into an emitted graph, reported by path shape), and
 * `provenance` (trust / entry ref / derivation chain across copies). Default:
 * all three. Each has been red for a real defect; a probe that has only ever
 * passed reports nothing and does not belong here.
 *
 * `CF_FIXTURE` selects the pattern source the real-pattern probes compile.
 * Use a REAL one: a hand-built fixture cannot exhibit a bug it has no shape
 * for, and every wrong "verified" on this work came from measuring one.
 *
 * Every line is `key: value`; a value that differs between two runs is the
 * finding. Nothing here asserts -- it reports, because what counts as correct
 * is the comparison, not any single run.
