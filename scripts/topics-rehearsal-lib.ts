/**
 * Shared plumbing for the Topics content export/restore pair
 * (`topics-export.ts`, `topics-restore.ts`) — the field vocabulary and the
 * pure functions both sides agree on, plus the `cf` helpers below.
 *
 * The two halves reach their space differently, because they are asking
 * different questions. A restore writes to a LIVE server, which only the CLI
 * can address, so it shells out to `cf` and tracks that contract — the surface
 * the rehearsal runbook already teaches. An export reads an offline snapshot
 * thousands of entities deep, where a subprocess per read costs a `deno task`
 * resolution and a fresh open of a multi-gigabyte database each time, so it
 * opens the store once through `@commonfabric/state-inspector` and uses none
 * of the `cf` helpers here.
 *
 * Because both sides import this file, it carries the narrower side's
 * permissions: nothing here may reach the store reader, whose barrel costs
 * every importer `--allow-ffi` at module load and would make the restore's
 * shebang a lie. That half lives in `topics-snapshot-lib.ts`, which only the
 * export imports, and the test file holds a check that it stayed there.
