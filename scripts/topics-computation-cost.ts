/**
 * Measures the Topics board's mention pivot, each topic's backlink lookup, and
 * a topic's comment and link aggregates over the headless Topics fixture,
 * across topic counts, mention graphs, thread lengths, and demand workloads.
 * The "Topics computation cost probe" section of
 * `docs/development/BENCHMARKS.md` documents the matrix, the options, and the
 * output.
 *
 * Each measured case runs in a child process of its own, so a case that
 * exhausts the heap ends that process rather than the run: this process records
 * the limit, skips the larger sizes of that case's series, and carries on. Any
 * other failure ends the run. Output is JSON lines on stdout; progress, and
 * everything a child prints, goes to stderr.
 *
 * Given `--derive-limits`, it instead runs the read-budget cases five times
 * each, writes the read-budget limits module to stdout, and runs each case
 * again under every regression variant its limits are assigned to, as the
 * "Topics read budget" section of `docs/development/BENCHMARKS.md` describes.
