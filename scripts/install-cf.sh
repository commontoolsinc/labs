#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Put `cf` on PATH.
#
# Only needed without mise — mise.toml already adds each checkout's bin/ to
# PATH. Shell completion is what makes this matter: the installed completion
# function calls `cf` by name on every Tab and swallows its errors, so with no
# `cf` on PATH completion silently yields nothing.
#
# It installs a COPY, not a symlink. `bin/cf` is self-contained — its job is to
# work out which checkout to run and hand off to it — so a copy carries the
# whole lookup: $CF_LABS_ROOT, then the nearest checkout walking up from the
# cwd. Neither depends on where the copy itself lives, so no particular
# checkout has to survive for the install to keep working.
#
# `bin/cfsh` is installed beside it, and survives being copied for a simpler
# reason: it is a forward to `cf sh` and finds `cf` by name, so it depends on
# PATH and on nothing about where it sits. It has no checkout to bake in,
# which is why only `cf` is rewritten on the way through.
#
# The one thing a copy cannot infer is which checkout to use when you are
# outside every checkout. That is baked in here as DEFAULT_LABS_ROOT, pointed
# at the PRIMARY checkout, since worktrees are removed routinely.
#
# The tradeoff is that upgrades are not free: a change to the lookup strategy
# reaches an installed copy only when this is re-run.
#
# It never edits your shell rc. The completion line is printed for you to add.

Usage: deno task install-cf [--dir <path>] [--dry-run]

  --dir <path>   Install into <path> instead of an auto-detected directory.
  --dry-run      Report what would happen; change nothing.

Installs copies of bin/cf and bin/cfsh onto PATH. bin/cf carries the checkout
lookup with it and bakes in the primary checkout as the default for when you
are outside every checkout; bin/cfsh opens a shuttle, the interactive shell,
and finds cf on PATH rather than baking anything in. Re-run it to upgrade both.
Prints the shell-completion line to add; never edits your shell rc.
