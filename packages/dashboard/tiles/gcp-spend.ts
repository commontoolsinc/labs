// cloud spend: month-to-date GCP cost from a BigQuery billing export, projected
// to a full-month total. Every figure is money the account actually pays: the
// cost of its usage after the credits that come off it. The daily series covers
// up to 45 finished UTC days. The rate window is highlighted. Early in the month
// it reaches into available prior-month history, up to a 14-day total. Cost from
// a day the export is still writing contributes only to the month-to-date total.
//
// The export lands a day's usage in batches spread over the day or two after it
// ends, and works on several days at once, so a day it has not finished holds
// only part of that day's cost and would drag down any rate measured over it.
// Nothing in the export marks a day as complete, so the tile establishes it two
// ways at once, each covering where the other is blind.
//
// The first is how much of the day the export has accounted for. Alongside cost,
// the query totals the billable time on a day's usage — the seconds of instance,
// disk, and other metered life the export has recorded. A running fleet books
// close to the same amount every day, and unlike cost it does not move when a
// promotion or a price change lands, so a day holding a small fraction of the
// day before it is one the export is still filling in.
//
// The second is how long the export has had. It reports when it last added a
// material batch to each day, which the tile turns into how long the export
// currently takes to finish with a day. That measurement comes from the export's
// own record over the window rather than a figure assumed here, so it tracks an
// export that speeds up or slows down. A day is finished once the export has had
// that long since the day ended.
//
// Billable time alone would accept a day the export happens to be most of the way
// through, and elapsed time alone would accept a day the export has fallen behind
// on. A day has to satisfy both. The chart and the rate window end at the newest
// day that does, and an export that has finished no day in several days grays the
// tile rather than projecting from stale history.
//
// The tile uses the BigQuery REST API, without bq or gcloud. It authenticates as
// the workload's service account in GKE, or with GCP_SA_KEY locally. That account
// needs BigQuery Job User on the query project and Data Viewer on the dataset.
