/**
 * Reports what the newest selection manifest would have a pull request
 * run: what share of the corpus fits five lanes.
 *
 * It goes amber on either of two counts. The manifest has gone stale, and
 * selection quality decays with it. Or the corpus holds a test that costs
 * more on its own than a whole lane's budget, which no packing can place,
 * so a pull request runs it only where its own diff makes it mandatory.
 * It goes red when a lane's projected work is past the bound the whole
 * design rests on.
 *
 * Two of those three want the sub line, and the red one takes it first.
 * Staleness wants the header facet instead, so it competes for neither.
 *
 * The packing itself — every lane, what each holds, and what each is
 * projected to spend — is a page away, along with every test no lane can
 * hold and what each was measured at.
 *
 * Following the dashboard's values (README.md): it reports on the system.
