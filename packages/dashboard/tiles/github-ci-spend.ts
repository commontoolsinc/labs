/**
 * Reports month-to-date GitHub cost and projects it to a full-month total. The
 * 45-day daily-spend chart labels the line with month-to-date spend.
 *
 * GitHub's enhanced billing report supplies daily net spend, one row per
 * product, SKU, repository and day. Every one of those rows counts here, so
 * the tile carries the organization's whole GitHub bill as a single figure:
 * Actions and its storage, Packages, Codespaces, Git LFS, models, sandboxes,
 * and the seat licenses GitHub meters — Copilot, Advanced Security, and
 * Enterprise Cloud. A product the organization does not use has no row and
 * adds nothing.
 *
 * A subscription GitHub bills outside that report does not reach the API at
 * all, and is absent from this figure. The package README records which spend
 * that is, under "What the GitHub figure covers".
 *
 * A day reaches the report a day or two after it ends, and a settled day with
 * no row is a day that spent nothing. That reading holds only while the report
 * is still writing rows, so a report whose newest row is too far back is
 * unavailable rather than a run of $0 days.
 *
 * The headline covers every product, while the budget the tile's color comes
 * from covers only the products someone has budgeted. Those two are held apart
 * rather than compared across: a product with no budget of its own is taken to
 * be spending within one, so it adds to the figure without coloring it. The
 * budget printed beside the headline stands in for those products at their own
 * projection, so the two figures on the tile cover the same products and the
 * headline sits at or under the budget exactly when the tile is green.
