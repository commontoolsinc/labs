/**
 * Reports how many tests are too noisy to judge a change by: the ones the
 * publisher measured disagreeing with themselves often enough to be held
 * back from pull requests. A flake list derived from measurement rather
 * than from anybody's judgement at one moment, which is what makes it
 * reverse on its own the moment a test is fixed.
 *
 * The line under the count says how much history the publisher measured over
 * and how long ago it measured. The chart shows the count in every available
 * manifest, with gaps for missing measurements. The tests are a page away.
 *
 * Following the dashboard's values (README.md): it reports on the system.
 * Neither the count nor the page behind it is aggregated per person, and
 * that page names tests, never the people who wrote or touched them.
