/**
 * Reports the repository's whole coverage debt and which way it is moving,
 * from what each day's `main` runs measured.
 *
 * The headline is the count of uncovered lines. Under it is the median day's
 * change over the recent window, which is the part that says whether the tests
 * are catching up with the code or falling behind it. A median rather than the
 * distance between the ends of the window: the series has steps in it, because
 * a change to what the metric counts moves the whole level in a single day, and
 * one such day cannot carry a median. The chart shows every day of the longer
 * window, with the days the median rests on picked out.
 *
 * Amber means that median is a rise. Half the days in the window have to have
 * risen for it to be one, so a day that added debt says nothing on its own. The
 * tile never turns red: nothing about coverage is a thing to act on at 2am, and
 * a red that nobody can act on costs the wall the color.
 *
 * Following the dashboard's values (README.md): it reports on the system. The
 * number is the repository's, never a package's owner's and never a person's,
 * and nothing here is aggregated per person.
