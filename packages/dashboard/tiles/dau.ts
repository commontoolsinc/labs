// dau: how many distinct identities were active per day, counted from the memory
// spans SigNoz already holds. Env-gated on SIGNOZ_URL + SIGNOZ_API_KEY.
//
// A memory session's principal is the signature-checked session.open issuer, and the
// server exports it as the user.did attribute on the memory.transact and
// memory.subscriber.sync spans. Counting the distinct values per UTC day therefore
// needs no new instrumentation. docs/development/active-user-counting.md records what
// the number means: an identity is a keypair rather than a person, so this counts
// active identities and leans on the assumption that one identity stands for one
// human. That assumption is the tile's, not the system's.
//
// Four properties of the signal decide what the number is worth:
//   - Opening a session emits no span of its own, so someone who only reads is never
//     attributed, and a day of purely read-only traffic reports zero.
//   - Service principals — the server's own identity, MEMORY_SERVICE_DIDS, background
//     services — are principals in the same way a person is. DAU_EXCLUDE_DIDS removes
//     them by hand; until it is set the count is an upper bound.
//   - Trace retention bounds the lookback to roughly a fortnight, and that retention
//     is a live setting on the database rather than anything a repository holds.
//   - Head sampling below 1.0 does not scale a distinct count down, it drops
//     identities out of it, and no arithmetic afterwards puts them back.
//
// The tile names its service explicitly (PROD_SERVICE) rather than counting whatever
// reports. A service that sends nothing comes back with no aggregations at all, which
// reads here as gray, so this can sit on the wall against a deployment whose tracing
// is still switched off and light up on its own when it is turned on.
