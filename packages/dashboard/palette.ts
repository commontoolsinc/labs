/**
 * Chooses the wall's status colors, and works out every shade derived from
 * them. Everything that paints a status in color reads from here: the tile,
 * the header dot, the headline, a sparkline's fade, a run cell, the drill-down
 * rows, and the favicon. The shape a header dot takes is CSS geometry rather
 * than a color, and lives with the rest of the tile's CSS in render.ts.
 *
 * Green sits at teal and amber at orange rather than at a yellow. The two then
 * differ along the blue-to-yellow axis, which red-green color blindness leaves
 * working, so good and warn stay apart for a viewer who cannot separate them
 * by the red-to-green axis alone. Color is one of four cues the wall carries:
 * the header dot also takes a per-status shape, the tile's wash and border get
 * stronger as the status gets more serious, and warn and bad carry a texture.
