/**
 * Projects and charts daily spend for every one of the dashboard's spend
 * tiles. A monthly estimate uses every settled day in the current month, and
 * until that supplies two weeks it fills the rate window from the end of the
 * prior month. A chart line ends on the day its source is known through — its
 * last reported day, or the newest day its reporting lag has settled — even
 * when another source's line runs further. A line skips the days its source
 * has no report to draw on, breaking across the hole rather than charting
 * zeros.
 *
 * A settled day with no report counts as a real $0, which holds only while the
 * source is still reporting. A tile establishes that from the newest day its
 * source has a report for, and stops reading a source whose reports have run
 * dry further back than its lag allows.
