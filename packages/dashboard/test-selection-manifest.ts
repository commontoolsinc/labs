/**
 * Reads the newest test-selection manifest from the store, and answers the
 * questions a tile or a page asks of the manifest it gets back. The bucket
 * is publicly readable, so no credential is involved, and a manifest is
 * untrusted input like every record line: it goes through the shared
 * validator whole.
 *
 * A store that cannot be read, and a body that is not a manifest, are
 * faults, and are raised as such: the wall grays a tile whose collection
 * throws and puts the reason under it. Reporting nothing is reserved for a
 * store that holds no manifest, which is the one case where "none has been
 * published" is true.
 *
 * One refusal is singled out from the rest, because it behaves
 * differently. A body that arrives whole and is refused over the version
 * it declares, and over nothing else, is settled: the store creates
 * objects and never overwrites one, so that body is what the name holds
 * and a later read gets the same answer. It carries its own type, so a
 * reader can record it and stop fetching the object, and so the wall can
 * say which version it found rather than the phrase it gives a source
 * that went quiet. Every other refusal stays a plain fault and is read
 * again.
 *
 * What separates the two is the version a body declares against the one
 * this reader is built for. That is decidable from the body alone. Asking
 * the validator instead, by offering it the body under this reader's own
 * version, is not: a shape that drops a field an earlier one required is
 * refused over the missing field rather than over the version, and the
 * calibration has already lost a field that way once.
 *
 * Following the dashboard's values (README.md): what this feeds reports on
 * the system. It names tests, never people.
