/**
 * Decides whether a series of measurements is trending, and turns that into
 * the status and the label a tile shows. A series is read two ways at once:
 * as a run of flat levels separated by change points, which is what a
 * regression that lands in one commit looks like, and as a single straight
 * line, which is what a gradual drift looks like. Whichever describes the
 * series more closely supplies the change that gets reported. Working in logs
 * throughout makes the answer a ratio, so a series of milliseconds and a
 * series of megabytes are judged on the same scale.
