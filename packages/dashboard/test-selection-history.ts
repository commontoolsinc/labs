/**
 * Collects compact measurements from every available selection manifest. The
 * shared reader keeps the latest full manifest for the detail page and stores
 * historical counts on disk. The bucket listing determines the chart's extent.
 *
 * An object whose schema this reader does not implement is fetched once
 * and then remembered for as long as the process runs, so a refresh does
 * not pay for it again. A manifest is the largest thing the wall fetches
 * and a whole store of them is tens of megabytes, against a refresh every
 * half minute. That opinion is held in memory and never written to the
 * cache file, because what a reader can validate is a property of the
 * build holding it: a later build reading the same store may accept what
 * this one refused, and a refusal on disk would outlive the reason for
 * it. Every other failed read is left to the next refresh, which may get
 * a different answer.
