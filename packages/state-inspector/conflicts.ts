// Conflicts & async — the contested/concurrent dimension of multiplayer state.
//
// The durable store records enough to reconstruct who fought over what:
//   - `revision` — every write, joinable to `commit.session_id` (the writer).
//   - `commit.original.reads.confirmed[]` — `ConfirmedRead { id, scope?, branch?,
//     path, seq, nonRecursive? }`: what each commit READ and at which seq.
//
// Two grounded views:
//   1. CONTENTION (write-write): entities written by ≥2 distinct sessions, with
//      the interleaved writer timeline — the back-and-forth of concurrent edits.
//   2. ANOMALOUS STALE READS (read-write): a committed confirmed read that the
//      engine's OWN conflict check would have rejected. We replay that exact
//      check here — resolving each read's declared scope via the engine's
//      `resolveScopeKey` and testing patch overlap with the engine's exported
//      `patchOverlapsRead` — so a hit is genuinely anomalous, not a benign
//      cross-scope or disjoint-path interleaving the runtime tolerates.
//
// HONESTY: the server VALIDATES every confirmed read before inserting a commit
// (`validateConfirmedReads` → `findConflictSeq` in `packages/memory/v2`), so a
// healthy store should yield ZERO stale reads here. A hit therefore flags an
// invariant violation / corruption, NOT normal "lost update" history. Rejected
// client commits aren't persisted; we never see them.
