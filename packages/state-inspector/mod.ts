// @commonfabric/state-inspector — offline autopsy of memory v2 space DBs.
//
// The durable store the server already wrote IS the flight recorder. This
// package is the lens over it: open a space SQLite file read-only, reconstruct
// state-at-(branch, seq), and answer who/what/when questions — no live runtime,
// no capture step. See README.md (and the `state-inspector` agent skill).
