// Scope awareness — the per-identity dimension the runtime composes and this
// tool (until now) ignored.
//
// `revision.scope_key` partitions an entity's rows into scopes that OVERLAP by
// id:
//   space                              shared / default      (PerSpace cells)
//   user:did:key:<DID>                 per-user state        (PerUser cells)
//   session:did:key:<DID>:<uuid>       per-session state     (PerSession cells)
//
// The same cell id can hold a `space` value AND a per-user override, and they
// differ (verified: `space` a link/default; `user` the concrete per-user state,
// e.g. a per-user VDOM).
//
// IMPORTANT — what the runtime actually does vs. what this view approximates.
// The runtime reads ONE declared scope_key at a time (via the engine's
// `resolveScopeKey`), and a narrowed write stores a LINK at the base-scope slot
// pointing at the narrow instance; readers reach the narrow value by FOLLOWING
// that link (see `packages/runner/src/data-updating.ts` / `scope.ts`). There is
// no read-time "fall back from session→user→space". So `valueAsIdentity` below
// is an APPROXIMATION — "the most-specific scope that holds this id" — not the
// runtime's resolution. {@link scopeOverlay} (every scope side-by-side) is the
// honest, runtime-true divergence view; prefer it. Scope-key construction reuses
// the wire-shape module's `resolveScopeKey` — the ONE definition of the
// scope_key format (key-vocabulary.md §3) — so encoding never drifts.
