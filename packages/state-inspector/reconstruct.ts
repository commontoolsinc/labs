// State-at-(branch, seq) reconstruction by replaying the append-only revision log.
//
// A memory v2 entity document has the shape `{ value: <FabricValue>, source?: … }`.
// Each `revision` row is one operation on that document:
//   - op="set"    → data is the whole replacement document
//   - op="patch"  → data is a JSON-Patch array applied to the document
//   - op="delete" → tombstone (document becomes absent)
//
// Replaying in (seq, op_index) order up to a target seq yields the document as
// of that point in the space's total order. This is the autopsy primitive:
// value-at-seq with no live runtime.
//
// Patch application reuses the SERVER's applier (`@commonfabric/memory/v2/patch`)
// rather than a re-implementation. That matters for fidelity: the server's
// JSON-Patch dialect includes a custom `splice` op and has specific add/remove
// strictness and missing-key creation semantics that a hand-rolled RFC-6902
// applier would get subtly wrong. `applyPatch` is offline-safe (pure value ops;
// no live runtime/cell). See packages/memory/v2/patch.ts.
