// Commit-rate churn over time — the retrospective, offline view of "is this
// space writing more than it should be?".
//
// Why this exists as its own query (see docs/plans/space-clone-rehearsal.md):
// `hotEntities` ranks entities by all-time write count, which cannot show a
// storm STARTING or a settle COMPLETING — both are shapes in time, not totals.
// The July 2026 Topics write storm (20 compiler-generated cells producing 96%
// of all commits, peaking at ~1,598 commits/minute) is invisible to a total and
// obvious in a rate curve.
//
// Two neighbors exist and neither fills this slot: the OTel commit telemetry
// reports live rates, but only where a collector was attached when it mattered;
// the workload diagnostics (labs#4950) instrument an orchestrated run of a live
// runtime. This reads the durable store after the fact — any space, any window,
// no instrumentation required at incident time.
//
// Deliberately threshold-free: it reports, it does not judge. What counts as
// "settled" differs per space, and a wrong default would give false confidence
// at exactly the moment a migration checklist is trusted most.
