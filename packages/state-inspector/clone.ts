// Rehearsal-grade space clones — a writable copy of a real space store, plus
// the bookkeeping that makes repeated rehearsal attempts comparable.
//
// Design + evidence: docs/plans/space-clone-rehearsal.md. Two findings from the
// July 2026 Topics migration shape this module:
//
//   * The COPY was never the hard part. A server-side `VACUUM INTO` already
//     emits one correctly-named, companion-free file, and a plain `cp` was
//     enough. So the copy path here is deliberately thin.
//   * The BOOKKEEPING was re-invented every attempt (ad-hoc SQL and Python
//     heredocs). Two rehearsals whose fingerprints were computed differently
//     cannot be compared, and an improvised check that quietly measures less
//     than last time looks exactly like a pass. The manifest is the payload.
//
// Layout written by `createClone`:
//
//   <dir>/clone.json               manifest: source, hashes, counts
//   <dir>/.cf-clone                marker — "this store is NOT production"
//   <dir>/pristine/<did>.sqlite    the baseline; never opened read-write
//   <dir>/engine-v3/<did>.sqlite   the working copy a toolshed serves
//
// `engine-v3/` is not decoration: it is the on-disk layout the memory server
// resolves through `resolveSpaceStoreUrl`, so pointing `MEMORY_DIR` at <dir>
// serves the clone as a live space under the SAME DID.
