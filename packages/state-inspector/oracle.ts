// Durable-history oracle — INV-1 (read coherence) over a whole space.
//
// `entityConflicts` (conflicts.ts) replays the engine's own admission check
// over one entity's commit history; a hit is by construction an invariant
// violation, since the server validated the same rule before persisting. This
// module lifts that per-entity forensic into a space-wide post-condition so
// concurrency tests can assert "this run produced a coherent store" instead
// of only their hand-written expectations.
//
// See docs/specs/memory-v2/09-invariants.md (INV-1) for the property, and
// test/engine-oracle.test.ts for proof the oracle detects seeded corruption
// (i.e. it is not vacuous).
