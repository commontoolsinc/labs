// number you can compare, and a diff when it didn't.
//
// Why (docs/plans/space-clone-rehearsal.md): the July 2026 Topics rehearsal
// verified content preservation with ad-hoc SQL and Python heredocs written
// fresh each attempt. Two rehearsals whose fingerprints were computed
// differently cannot be compared, and an improvised check that quietly measures
// less than last time looks exactly like a pass. This is that check, computed
// one way.
//
// COMPILER-GENERATED CELLS ARE EXCLUDED BY DEFAULT. A pattern update rotates
// generated internal-cell identities on purpose (labs#4916), so including them
// guarantees the fingerprint changes on every legitimate migration — which
// makes it useless as a "content survived" signal. Verified against the real
// Estuary Topics store: all 20 write-storm cells (192,381 revisions, 90.3% of
// every revision) are `$generated`, and NONE of them is authored content.
//
// Hashing goes through `@commonfabric/data-model` — the same
// canonicalizing hash the runtime derives entity ids with, so this cannot drift
// from the engine's notion of value identity.
