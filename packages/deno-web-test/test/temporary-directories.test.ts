/**
 * What a harness run leaves in the directory it makes its temporary files in.
 *
 * The run is given a `TMPDIR` of this test's own, and does not have it to
 * itself: Chrome writes its own scratch files into the directory `TMPDIR`
 * names and leaves some of them behind, files and directories alike. What the
 * run makes for itself carries the prefix `Manifest.create()` gives it, and
 * that prefix is what the assertion reads rather than the directory being
 * empty. `manifest.test.ts` is what pins the prefix onto the directory, so
 * that a run making no such directory would fail there rather than pass
 * silently here.
 *
 * `BrowserProcess.close()` returns once every process holding the browser's
 * output pipes has gone, and the run closes the browser before it returns.
 * Nothing the run started is writing into the directory while it is read
 * below.
