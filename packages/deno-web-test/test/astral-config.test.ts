/**
 * What `extractAstralConfig()` hands a launch, and the one decision in it: a

 *
 * Every case here pins `ASTRAL_BIN_PATH` to a file that certainly exists, so
 * that what the search would have found on the machine running the tests never
 * enters into it. An assertion conditional on the answer would pass on a
 * machine with no browser, which is to say it would pass for the regression.
