/**
 * The Group A checks: what one run's own artifacts say about the CFC clauses
 * the harness answers to.
 *
 * Each check is an expression of the clauses it cites and of nothing else. It
 * reads only the artifact tree — no live runtime, no space database, no
 * network — so what it can establish is bounded by what the run wrote down,
 * and it says so: an artifact the check needs and did not find makes the
 * check `inconclusive`, never `pass`.
 *
 * Every check declares what falsifies it. A check nothing could falsify is a
 * sentence about the specification rather than a test of an implementation,
 * and `test/seeded-violations.test.ts` holds each one to its declaration by
 * seeding exactly that shape and requiring the verdict to turn.

/**
 * The writers other than a tool the model called that persist a file into a

 * `persistToolOutput`.
 *
 * A delegation writes the child's final text there as the trusted side's own
 * validation evidence, and a `run_pattern` call writes the source text it
 * carried beside that call's own output, under the same output id. Neither is
 * a tool effect: each joins to no tool activity, no policy decision is
 * expected for it, and its absence from the report's `toolOutputs` is not an
 * unrecorded effect.
 *
 * These are writing paths rather than contents. `persistToolOutput` names its
 * file `<outputId>-<writer>.json`, and neither half is a string a tool
 * invocation supplies: the output id is a host counter, and a writer name here
 * is not a `BuiltinToolId`, so no tool the model calls is persisted under one.
 * An exemption keyed on a field inside the file would be keyed on the artifact
 * being judged — a model-authored output carries a `type` of its choosing as
 * easily as a host-written one does, and the check would then be asking the
 * subject whether to look at it.
 *
 * What this does NOT establish, and a reader should not take from it: that the
 * name is beyond a model's reach altogether. The artifact root defaults inside
 * the workspace, and `bash` does not consult the reserved-artifact guard that
 * `write_file`, `edit_file`, `read_file` and `view_image` share, so a run that
 * can execute a shell can create a file under any name it likes — including
 * one of these. The type-keyed exemption this replaced was evadable by exactly
 * the same capability, so nothing here is weaker; what closes it is the other
 * discriminator, a host-side record of which outputs the harness authored,
 * which is a change to what a run writes rather than to what the audit reads.

 * that was minted and is gone — and it is the only artifact-side witness to a
 * tool losing EVERY context it recorded. Without it, the set of tools that
 * transport CFC evidence is read off the contexts that survived, so a tool
 * whose contexts all vanished leaves that set and reads as host-side: the run
 * looks like one that never went near the substrate rather than one whose
 * evidence went missing. A surviving context for another tool is what hides
 * it, because the run then holds contexts and the warning for a run holding
 * none does not fire either.
 *
 * The numbering is not the model's to influence: it is a host counter, and
 * `invocationContextsOf` reads it across both artifacts that carry the list,
 * so deleting a copy from one of them recovers rather than hides.
 *
 * What this cannot see, and what nothing read from artifacts alone can: a
 * deletion taking the highest-numbered contexts from every artifact at once
 * leaves `1..N` complete for a smaller N, and is indistinguishable from a run
 * that stopped there. A run that retained no context at all is that case at

 * blind spot on its own: two artifacts that each lost a DIFFERENT context
 * union back to a complete sequence, so a loss either artifact alone would
 * expose is masked. A trace holding `[1]` beside a run state holding `[2]` is
 * that shape.
 *
 * The test is containment rather than equality, and that is the whole
 * distinction. The trace is written from the run state at each report, so an
 * interrupted run leaves the trace a subset of the live record — a write that

 * else, which is why it can cite the clause as `required-by`. A run's
 * cell-labels snapshot is not among them, and asking for it here would have
 * been one check answering to two authorities — the shape AUD-15 and AUD-15a
 * are split along. {@link cellLabelsSnapshot} carries it as `extends`.
 *
 * What AH-CFC-16 obliges a run to retain is bounded by what its execution
 * produced. An invocation context is minted where a call reaches the CFC
 * substrate, so a side effect that never goes near it mints none, and the
 * clause is answered by the artifacts the run does hold. Which side effects
 * could have carried one is read by the classifier AUD-2 uses, so a run that
 * transports evidence for a tool and then calls it carrying none fails both
 * checks: the call is unattested, and what would explain its result is gone.
 *
 * A run that recorded no context at all is the case the artifacts cannot
 * decide. A tool activity states its identity and its effect class and not
 * where it ran, so a run whose side effects were all host-side and a run that
 * lost every context it minted are the same tree, and passing it would report
 * an absence as a clean shape. That run warns, naming the ambiguity as the
 * finding. It is AH-CFC-16's own — retention that cannot be confirmed —
 * beside rather than inside AUD-2's warn on AH-CFC-15, which is about an
 * enforcing claim that went untested.

What is left open is narrower and is this check's own: the engine reads a space's cell labels only for the refs its handle table holds, so a run that minted no handle has nothing to record, and whether an audit should report that at all is undecided.

 * check. AH-CFC-16's enumeration — prompt-slot evidence, invocation-context
 * references, mediation dispositions, policy events, model-context influence
 * state, side-effect decisions — does not include cell labels. The snapshot is
 * worth having for the same reason those are: without it, a later reading
 * cannot say what the enforcement was enforcing against. That is our judgment
 * about what explains a run, not the clause speaking, and a finding here says
 * so.
 *
 * Two absences, reported differently, because the artifacts distinguish them.
 * A read the run attempted and failed is evidence that was reachable and is
 * gone. A read nobody attempted is a run that never held a ref to ask about —
 * the engine reads labels only for the refs in the handle table — and calling
 * that a lost artifact would report a run's shape as its failure. Which of
 * the two the obligation should want is the open question CT-2210 carries,
 * and until it is settled the check reports the fact and names the issue
 * rather than deciding it.
