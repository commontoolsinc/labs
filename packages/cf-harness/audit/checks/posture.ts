/**
 * The Group C checks: what the posture a run recorded says about itself.
 *
 * Group A reads what a run did. These read what it declared it was doing —
 * the fabric-session dial tuple, the posture record those dials resolve to,
 * and where each value came from. A posture is a claim, and a claim is worth
 * checking against two things: the matrix, which says which claims are
 * coherent, and the record's own contents, which say whether the claim covers
 * what it appears to cover.
 *
 * These checks WARN and FAIL on a recording; they do not stop a run. The
 * runtime does not yet refuse a non-conforming tuple at construction time
 * (CT-2179), so what an audit can say about one is that it was recorded.
 *
 * What a recorded posture IS, is the other thing to hold on to. The harness
 * writes its record before the session's runtime exists, so the record is a
 * projection — what the run expected to be at — and it says so
 * (`provenance`). A finding here therefore reports on a declaration, and every
 * message says which it read: a projected record establishes nothing about
 * what a runtime honored, and an audit that let one read as an attestation
 * would be the very confusion it exists to catch.
