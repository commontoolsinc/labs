/**
 * The citation table: every clause of the agent-harness specification an

 * check turns on.
 *
 * A check that states its own rule in its own words is independent state, and
 * independent state diverges from the specification it was written against
 * without anything saying so. A citation closes that: the quote is copied out
 * of the document verbatim, so an edit that changes what the clause requires
 * breaks `test/citation-drift.test.ts` and reaches the check with it.
 *
 * Line numbers are deliberately absent. A clause id and a quote survive a
 * document being reordered; a line number names a different clause the moment
 * a paragraph is inserted above it.
