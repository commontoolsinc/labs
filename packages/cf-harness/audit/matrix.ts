/**
 * The deployment mode matrix as data: which points of the CFC dial cube are
 * conforming, and which advances of one dial ahead of another the spec's
 * partial order forbids or weakens.
 *
 * `docs/specs/cfc-enforcement-matrix.md` states these as prose and a table.
 * A check that restated them in its own words would be independent state, so
 * each rule here carries the citation whose words it turns on, and the
 * citation-drift test reads them back out of the document. A rule reworded
 * past its quote breaks there, which is the notice that the rule needs
 * rewriting too.
 *
 * The rules are one-sided on purpose. Each says what a tuple must NOT be, and
 * a tuple violating none of them is conforming — the same shape the spec's own
 * "everything else is free" paragraph has, and the shape that keeps a new
 * dial from silently widening what counts as conforming.
