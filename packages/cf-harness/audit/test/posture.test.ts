/**
 * What the Group C checks say when the evidence is thin, which over real
 * artifact trees is most of the time.
 *
 * `seeded-violations.test.ts` holds each check to the shape it is supposed to
 * catch; these are the other arms — a run with no session, a session recorded
 * before the posture record existed, a run state that did not load. They are
 * not edge cases: a smoke over 239 historic console runs lands on them 221
 * times, and the difference between `inconclusive` and `pass` there is the
 * difference between an audit that reports what it established and one that
 * reports the absence of evidence as evidence.
