/**
 * What each check is for: the shape it is supposed to catch, seeded into a
 * clean run and required to turn that check's verdict and no other's.
 *
 * The two halves matter equally. A check whose verdict never turns cannot
 * fail, and a check that reports a finding on every neighboring mutation says
 * nothing about the clause it cites. Each case here therefore asserts the
 * whole verdict map, so a check that widens to catch its neighbor's violation
 * fails here rather than in a reviewer's reading.
 *
 * The mutations are in memory. Nothing writes into the fixture tree, which is
 * the same discipline the checker itself holds to.
