/**
 * Writes `audit/test/fixtures/`: one clean artifact tree for the audit suites
 * to read.
 *
 * The tree is produced by the harness itself — a real `CfHarnessPromptLoop`
 * against a scripted model and a fake sandbox, writing through the real
 * `FileSystemHarnessArtifactStore`. Hand-written JSON would drift from the
 * shapes the harness actually persists, and a checker tested only against
 * hand-written JSON tests the fixture rather than the harness.
 *
 * The run is arranged so that every check has something to look at: an
 * enforcing posture, a mediated observation carrying a confidentiality label,
 * an observation the sandbox could not attest and the harness therefore
 * denied, an input cell whose handle the model spends, and a delegation whose
 * child is written beside it.
 *
 * `deno task cfc-audit-fixtures` runs this. It is not run by the suites: the
 * tree is committed, and regenerating it is a deliberate act whose diff is
 * part of the review. Timestamps and model-attempt durations are the run's
 * own, so a regeneration is expected to move them.
