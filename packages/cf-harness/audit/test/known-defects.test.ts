/**
 * That a Group E finding says enough about itself to be recorded, and that
 * what it says is true of the message beside it.
 *
 * These checks fail by design until their defects are fixed, so a nightly
 * running the audit has to be told which of its findings were already known.
 * The register that does that reads a check id, a run selector, a substring of
 * the finding's message, a reason and an issue. Five of those six come off the
 * finding, and the one property that makes them usable is the one nothing else
 * would catch: that `detail` is genuinely a substring of `message`. An entry
 * copied from a finding whose detail was not in its message would match
 * nothing, be reported stale forever, and the fix would look like the gap
 * having closed.
