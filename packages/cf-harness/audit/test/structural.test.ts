/**
 * What each check reads, one reading per case.
 *
 * `seeded-violations.test.ts` proves each check can fail and that it fails
 * alone; this file pins the rest of what a check says — which artifact it
 * falls back to when the one it prefers is gone, which shapes it calls
 * `not-applicable` rather than `pass`, and what its findings name. The runs
 * here are built rather than recorded, so each carries exactly the one shape
 * its case is about.
