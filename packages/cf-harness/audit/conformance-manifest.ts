/**
 * Where `@commonfabric/cf-harness` stands against `CfcAgentHarnessProfile`, as
 * data the audit reads and prints rather than as prose in a document nobody
 * re-reads.
 *
 * This file is the source of that position. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROFILE.md`
 * points at it and does not restate a status, because two encodings of one
 * truth is the disease this audit exists to document: a consistency check
 * across two copies cannot detect a consistent wrong answer, and the copy
 * nobody runs is the one that goes stale.
 *
 * The manifest is itself audited. Where an obligation names covering checks,
 * {@link reconcileConformanceManifest} holds its status to their verdicts, and
 * a disagreement is a failure of the audit run. Without that, a manifest is
 * prose in a new file format: it could assert `mechanized` about an obligation
 * whose check has been failing for a month, and nothing would say so. The
 * direction that matters most is the one that catches good news — an
 * obligation still recorded as unmet whose every covering check now passes is
 * a gap that closed while the manifest stood still.
 *
 * An obligation with no covering check is NOT reconciled, and the report says
 * so rather than counting it as agreement. Four of the nine are in that state
 * and one of them (H3) is `mechanized` by the type system rather than by
 * anything an artifact tree can show; calling those "agreeing" would report
 * the absence of a check as a check that passed, which is the same error
 * `inconclusive` exists to prevent.
