/**
 * The console surface: type a task, watch the harness work, open what it
 * built. One HTTP server holding one in-process
 * `HarnessInteractiveChatService`, one static page reading its events over
 * Server-Sent Events, and nothing else.
 *
 *   deno task --cwd packages/cf-harness console
 *   open http://127.0.0.1:8100
 *
 * The server binds 127.0.0.1, and loopback is where its trust ends rather than
 * where it begins: a page anywhere on the web can drive requests at this
 * socket, and a hostile name that resolves to 127.0.0.1 can make these routes
 * same-origin. So every request has to name this server's own host, and every
 * `/api` route except health has to carry the per-process token the page is
 * handed as a `SameSite=Strict` cookie when it loads — a token a cross-origin
 * caller cannot send and a rebound origin cannot obtain. Do not put this
 * behind a public address.
 *
 * What a task runs under is not decided here. This server resolves flags, the
 * environment and the request body into a `HarnessSessionConfig` — the same
 * description the batch CLI resolves argv into — and `src/session-assembly.ts`
 * turns that into the run. So a capability configurable on the CLI is
 * configurable here by the same name, and the tools a session offers are
 * derived from what it can back rather than listed by this file.
 *
 * The one piece of configuration this surface insists on is the fabric
 * session, whose space has to be a name rather than a `did:key`: `assign_slug`
 * composes a piece's URL from the name and offers none for a DID, and finishing
 * with a link rather than a transcript is what this surface is for.
