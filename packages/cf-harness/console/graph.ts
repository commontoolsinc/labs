/**
 * A run as a data-flow graph: the patterns it ran, the cells those patterns

 *
 * The harness's model is that work happens by running patterns over handles —
 * a pattern reads a cell the agent only ever named, computes in the space, and
 * hands back a reference to what it made. A graph of that is the shape of the
 * question "does this data flow look right": which cells a pattern was wired
 * to read, what it produced, what got named, and which confidentiality atoms
 * ride along each edge.
 *
 * Every node and edge records the step it appeared at, so the graph can be
 * shown as it stood at any point of the timeline rather than only at the end.
