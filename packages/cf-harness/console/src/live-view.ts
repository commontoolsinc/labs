/**
 * One session's work as it happens, in a pane narrow enough to sit beside the
 * thing that asked for it. A host that can only open a plain web address —
 * Loom's task panel among them — opens `/live/<sessionId>` and watches the
 * harness build the piece it asked for, until the piece itself replaces the
 * pane.
 *
 * The event stream is the source. Its durable log is replayed from sequence
 * zero when the page loads, so a pane opened halfway through a turn shows what
 * already happened rather than only what comes next, and a reconnect resumes
 * from the last sequence rendered. Nothing here polls.
 *
 * What the stream carries is the order and the outcome; what a call was given,
 * what CFC decided about it, and what was withheld from the model live in the
 * run's artifacts. So a run is re-read when one of its tool calls completes —
 * the turn's own, whose id is the turn id, and a `delegate_task` child's, whose
 * calls its parent's run does not record — and the two readings are joined by
 * tool call id. The join is what puts a CFC line under a step in a pane that is
 * otherwise a feed.
