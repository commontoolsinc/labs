/**
 * The console's one launch path: resolve its configuration from the fabric
 * being started, print what each value resolved to and where it came from, and
 * serve.
 *
 *   deno task --cwd packages/cf-harness console:launch --instance loom
 *   deno task --cwd packages/cf-harness console:launch \
 *     --fabric-api-url http://localhost:8000 --store <dir>
 *
 * The console needs an identity, a space, a toolshed URL, the store that
 * toolshed serves, and the two `runsc-cfc` sidecar directories the sandbox's
 * mediation moves over. An operator transcribing those by hand gets a console
 * that starts cleanly and is wrong: a store keyed to a superseded labs pin
 * reads as "no data at cell", and sidecar directories no registered runtime
 * writes drop every input label in silence. So each value is derived from the
 * record that decides it, tagged with where it came from, and printed once
 * before the server binds. Anything that cannot be derived is a named flag
 * whose absence is an error naming it, never a default nobody chose.
 *
 * A loom instance is one source among several rather than the shape of this
 * module: `--instance` reads the identity, space and toolshed URL off that
 * instance's records, and a fabric with no instance behind it names them
 * itself. Arguments after `--` reach the console untouched, so a flag this
 * launcher has no opinion about is still reachable through it rather than
 * through a second launch path.
 *
 * `scripts/start-local-dev.sh --cf-harness` is what calls this for the fabric
 * it is starting, and is how a person starts a console. The console's own flags
 * and routes are in [`README.md`](README.md); the operator procedure is in
 * [`../docs/WEAVER.md`](../docs/WEAVER.md).
