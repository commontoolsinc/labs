/**
 * P-prompt-authority (AH-CFC-3/4/5): only a direct command authorizes a side
 * effect.
 *
 * A prompt slot carries a role, and the role is where authority lives. Text
 * the operator typed binds as `direct-command`; text that arrived by some
 * other route — a document a tool retrieved, the body of a skill, something
 * the model quoted back — binds as `context` or `quote`. Content cannot
 * promote itself by asking, so a side-effect request under any of those, or
 * under no binding at all, is refused.
 *
 * The refusal codes are the assertion. Five of the six `*_requires_direct_command`
 * codes appeared in no test before this file, so the negative direction was
 * carried by reading the switch rather than by running it.
