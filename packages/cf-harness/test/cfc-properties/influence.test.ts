/**
 * P-influence (AH-CFC-7/8): what the model read accumulates, what it did not
 * does not.
 *
 * One mediated `bash` call carries both directions. Its `stdout` comes back
 * observed under a confidentiality label, so the model read labeled content
 * and the run must carry influence for it. Its `stderr` comes back denied, so
 * the model read nothing and the run must carry no influence for it.
 *
 * AUD-8 is the assertion. Over the 239-run corpus it is `not-applicable` on
 * every run — no run there ever exposed a labeled channel — so a `pass` here
 * is the check's first exercise against evidence rather than against absence.
