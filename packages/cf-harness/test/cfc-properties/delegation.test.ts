/**
 * P-delegation (AH-CFC-12/13): what a child gets, and what bounds it.
 *
 * AH-CFC-12 binds **capabilities** — "a child receives only the authority,
 * labels, skills, and capabilities explicitly bound to the child profile."
 * The CFC specification's §18.2.4.3 bounds **observation**. Those are not the
 * same claim, and a child handed a read capability together with a handle
 * satisfies the first while the second is still an open question about it.
 *
 * This file drives a real delegation to find out which the harness implements,
 * and the answer is: both, at different layers, and it matters which.
 *
 * At the **address** layer observation is not bounded. A token the delegation
 * named is swapped for the bare reference in whatever the child dispatches, so
 * a child with a shell reads through it exactly as the parent would have. The
 * handle is an indirection over an address, not a boundary around a value.
 *
 * At the **output** layer it is. The child's observation returns through the
 * same mediation the parent's would, so under an enforcing profile an
 * unmediated read comes back as a typed denial rather than as content. That is
 * what stops the unbounded address from becoming an unbounded observation.
 *
 * The distinction is the reportable part. An implementation that kept the
 * capability binding and dropped the output mediation would still satisfy
 * AH-CFC-12 as written, and would leak.
