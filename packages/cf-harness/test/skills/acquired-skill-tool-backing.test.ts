/**
 * Which backing makes `run_skill_script` a tool a run offers.
 *
 * Its two backings are independent, and the gate that reads them is the one
 * that decides whether a child holding a mounted acquired skill can execute
 * anything at all. A child's tool surface passes through
 * `withheldToolIds` a second time inside its own prompt loop, so an allowance
 * added upstream survives only if the backing agrees.
