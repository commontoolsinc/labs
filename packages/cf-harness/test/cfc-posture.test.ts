/**
 * The session posture a run records, and the lines a surface prints from it.

 * The projection is the part worth pinning: it is what the console and the run
 * state publish before the session's runtime exists, and it says so. The
 * renderer is pinned because it is the only form most operators ever see the
 * record in — an ungated sink that did not reach the output is a gap nobody
 * reads about.
