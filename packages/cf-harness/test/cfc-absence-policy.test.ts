/**
 * That the absence policy a mode publishes is the absence policy it enacts.
 *
 * `cfcAbsenceBehaviorForMode` is the one derivation of what a mode does with
 * an observation whose trusted mediation metadata is absent. Two readers act
 * on it: the capability snapshot publishes it, so a reader of a run's
 * artifacts learns what the run would do, and the model-facing output path
 * decides whether such an observation reaches the model. This file drives the
 * second and compares it against the first.
 *
 * The comparison is written as a table keyed by the published behavior rather
 * than by the mode. A test that hard-codes an outcome per mode passes whether
 * or not the two agree; keying on the descriptor means an edit that changes
 * one without the other fails here, which is the drift this file exists to
 * make impossible.
