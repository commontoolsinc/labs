# cf-harness Documentation

This directory contains live documentation for the current `cf-harness`
implementation. The repository-wide lifecycle rules in
[`../../../docs/README.md`](../../../docs/README.md) apply here: current
reference and intended designs stay live; completed plans and point-in-time
migration notes live under `docs/history/` at the repository root.

## Start here

- [Package README](../README.md) — operator entry point, commands, and detailed
  feature reference.
- [CURRENT_STATE.md](CURRENT_STATE.md) — concise current architecture,
  integrations, and known gaps.
- [IMPLEMENTATION_PROFILE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PROFILE.md) — conformance statement
  against the Agent Harness specification.
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) — remaining work only; shipped milestones are not
  repeated as a plan.
- [SKILLS_SUPPORT_SPEC.md](SKILLS_SUPPORT_SPEC.md) — live
  implementation-specific skills contract and future dynamic-activation design.
- [pattern-index-measurement.md](pattern-index-measurement.md) — how a run
  against the pattern index is measured so two runs can be compared: the task
  wording rule the finding rests on, what a batch records, and what its counts
  do and do not establish.
- [WEAVER.md](WEAVER.md) — the operator procedure for driving the console from
  Weaver's command pill: loom, the console on loom's fabric, and Weaver
  configured, so a harness-built piece lands in the person's own space.
- [system-map/](system-map/README.md) — an interactive map of the harness and
  the runtime around it, drawn by trust boundary: where every gate sits and its
  status, where the threats lie and which are closed by planned work, guarded by
  CFC, or held by people and process; with the procedure for keeping it true.

The system map moves in lockstep with the implementation. A change that lands or
downgrades a gate, adds a boundary, threat, sink, or posture, or changes what
`CURRENT_STATE.md` or `IMPLEMENTATION_PROFILE.md` says updates the map's data
tables and `SNAPSHOT` in the same pull request, following the map's
[update procedure](system-map/README.md#updating-it). The map is a reading aid,
never a source of truth; when it disagrees with code, the map is wrong.

## Normative boundary

The implementation-independent runtime and CFC contracts live in
[`docs/specs/agent-harness/`](../../../docs/specs/agent-harness/README.md). This
package owns exact CLI flags, tools, profiles, schemas, defaults, artifacts, and
deviations. Loom and Pattern Factory own their adapter and rollout behavior.

## Historical records

- [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](../../../docs/history/packages/cf-harness/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
  — the April 2026 package bootstrap plan and checkpoint.
- [`LOOM_MIGRATION_NOTES.md`](../../../docs/history/packages/cf-harness/docs/LOOM_MIGRATION_NOTES.md)
  — the April 2026 pre-integration assessment of Loom's Codex paths.

Historical documents are useful background, not descriptions of the current
system.
