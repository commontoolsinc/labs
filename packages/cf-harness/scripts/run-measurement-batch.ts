/**
 * Run a list of console tasks unattended and write the measurement report.
 *
 * One task per session, one at a time. A fresh session per task is what the
 * measurement rests on — a session that has already searched the index is not
 * a session discovering it — and running them in sequence is what makes an
 * index change attributable to the task that caused it.
 *
 * Nothing here waits on a clock. A completed or failed turn settles on the
 * console's own `turn_completed` or `turn_failed` event, read off the
 * server-sent event stream. A canceled turn does not: the service emits
 * `turn_canceled` while the prompt loop is still unwinding, so the batch holds
 * that outcome and settles it on the session's own `status_changed` back to
 * idle, once the run's artifacts are on disk. A turn that never ends is a
 * batch that never ends, which is a hang an operator can see and cancel rather
 * than a bound that turns a slow run into a failed one.
 *
 * [The measurement protocol](../docs/pattern-index-measurement.md) is what
 * says which tasks belong in a suite and how they must be worded. Read it
 * before writing one: **a task must not mention the pattern index.** A task
 * that says "search the index for a counter" measures obedience rather than
 * discovery, and the finding this instrument exists to produce evaporates.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   deno task measure-batch suite.json
 *   deno task measure-batch suite.json --console=http://127.0.0.1:8103
 *   deno task measure-batch suite.json --out=./measurements/tonight
 *   deno task measure-batch suite.json --fabric-api-url=http://localhost:8040
 *   deno task measure-batch suite.json --expect-git-sha=<sha>
 *   deno task measure-batch suite.json --cell-spec=./cell.json
 *   deno task measure-batch suite.json --allow-diverged
 *
 * `--cell-spec` is what refuses a misconfigured console before the first task
 * spends anything: the file states the tools, subagent profiles, system
 * prompt, space and stores this experiment requires, and the batch checks them
 * against what the console says a session here would run under.

It **counts what each run did**: the searches it issued and what the index
answered them with, whether it ran a published pattern by id or compiled
source of its own, which published patterns that source imported, how much it
delegated, and what it named at the end.

It **does not say whether what a run built works.** Nothing in this report
renders a piece or opens one in a browser. \`run_pattern\` reporting \`ok\`
means the pattern compiled and its result matched the schema it declared — a
pattern whose every cell renders as \`[object Object]\` reports \`ok\` and
publishes clean. Whether a published pattern works is CT-2107's subject, and a
count that is read as answering it is worse than no count at all.

It **does not establish why** a run did what it did. A search that found
nothing and a search the index refused are counted apart here for exactly that
reason: the second says nothing about the corpus.

It **does not say whether a run found what it asked for.** A search hit is a
hit against a *description*, and a description in this index is not reliably a
description of the program behind it: entries advertising a grocery checklist
and a reading list have turned out to be a counter and a program with no
interface at all. So a hit counted here is a hit, not a match.

It **does not read a bare re-export as composition.** Source that imports a
published pattern and exports it unchanged is counted apart from source that
puts one to work, because the index holds entries that are exactly that and
they would otherwise inflate the reading.

**These numbers are comparable to another batch's only if the index readings
above match.** The corpus changes underneath a measurement — entries are
seeded, archived, and rescored between runs — and a change in what the runs did
is as easily an effect of that as of anything in the harness.

A run this could not read is counted as not read, never as a run that did
nothing.
