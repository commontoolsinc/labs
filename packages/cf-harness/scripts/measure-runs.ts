/**
 * Count what console runs did with the pattern index.
 *
 * The console writes each run to `<artifact-root>/<run-id>/`, and a
 * `delegate_task` child to `<run-id>.subagent.<n>/`. This walks that tree and
 * counts, per run family: the searches issued and what the index answered
 * them with, the `run_pattern` calls split by whether they named a published
 * pattern or carried source, the `cf:pattern:` specifiers that source
 * imported, the delegations, and the slugs assigned.
 *
 * What the count establishes and what it does not is the subject of
 * [the measurement protocol](../docs/pattern-index-measurement.md). In short:
 * these are counts of what a run *did*. Nothing here reads a rendered piece,
 * so nothing here says whether what the run built works.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   deno task measure-runs                       # every family under the root
 *   deno task measure-runs <run-id> [<run-id>…]  # named families only
 *   deno task measure-runs --json                # machine-readable
 *   deno task measure-runs --artifact-root=DIR   # a root other than the default
