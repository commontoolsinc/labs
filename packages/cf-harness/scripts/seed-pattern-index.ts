/**
 * Publishes the composable atoms under `packages/patterns/primitives` to the
 * pattern index, so a harness run has parameterized parts to find rather than
 * only whole applications that take no inputs.
 *
 * Everything the index stores about an atom is derived from the atom's own
 * source. The description is the first paragraph of its doc comment, and the
 * tags come from `@hashtags` and `@keywords` lines in the same comment, so the
 * claim the index advertises sits beside the code that has to honour it and
 * moves when that code moves. An atom whose doc comment carries neither tag
 * line is refused rather than published under a guess.
 *
 * The identity an atom is published under is its compiled entry identity —
 * the content-addressed value `run_pattern` publishes under, read back off the
 * compiled artifact through `getArtifactEntryRef`. It is stable across runs of
 * this script for unchanged source, which is what makes re-running idempotent:
 * `publishPattern` answers `created: false` for an identity the index already
 * holds.
 *
 * The compile runs inside the harness's own Fabric session rather than a
 * runtime built beside it. That is load-bearing rather than convenient: a
 * `PiecesController` pulls its experimental flags from the deployment it
 * connects to, and at least one of them (`contentAddressedSchemas`) bears on
 * content hashing. A runtime constructed here with default options could
 * compute an identity no composing run would ever recompute, and a
 * `cf:pattern:` import of that identity is refused outright rather than
 * silently degraded. So a dry run connects to the fabric too — it compiles
 * exactly what a real run compiles, and only the index writes are withheld.
