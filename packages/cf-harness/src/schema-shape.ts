/**
 * Reduction of a JSON Schema to the part of it that is STRUCTURE: property
 * names, types, nesting, required-ness, and array/object composition. The
 * result is what `describe_handle` may disclose about a referent whose schema
 * the harness did not write.
 *
 * The rule is deny-by-default. A reduced schema is REBUILT from an allowlist
 * of structural keywords rather than copied with a few keywords deleted, so a
 * keyword nobody thought about is absent rather than disclosed, and so is
 * every keyword nested inside `properties`, `items`, `$defs`, or a
 * combinator. That matters because a schema is a place a value can hide:
 * `const`, `enum`, `default`, and `examples` carry values outright, and
 * `title`, `description`, `$comment`, and `pattern` carry free text that
 * whoever authored the schema chose. A shape tells a model what code to
 * write; none of the rest is needed to write it.
 *
 * Identifiers get the same treatment wherever they are not needed. A property
 * name crosses, because nothing can be written over data without it. A
 * definition name does not: it names a place in the schema rather than a place
 * in the data, so every `$defs` and `definitions` key is replaced by an opaque
 * `d0`, `d1`, … and every `$ref` that resolves to one is rewritten to match. A
 * `$ref` that resolves to nothing is dropped rather than disclosed, since a
 * dangling pointer is a string its author chose and nothing else.
 *
 * Because property names are the one channel that crosses, they are the one
 * channel that has to be bounded. A name past
 * {@link MAX_PROPERTY_NAME_LENGTH}, and every property past
 * {@link MAX_DISCLOSED_PROPERTIES} of one object, is omitted, and an object
 * that omitted any of its properties reports `additionalProperties: true` so
 * the shortened list is never read as the whole of them.
