/**
 * An isolated runtime for the render gate's probe, and the reason it exists.
 *
 * The gate renders a second instance of a pattern to see what its `$UI` does.
 * Running that instance in the session's own space is not acceptable, and the
 * reason is stronger than it first appears: `runPersistent` allocates a
 * space-scoped entity and persists the probe's inputs, its piece metadata and
 * its whole result graph, and `runner.stop()` cancels execution and
 * subscriptions without deleting anything. Staying out of the piece registry
 * does not help either — Memory v2 enumerates live entities by id and the
 * FUSE projection hydrates them, so the orphan is reachable from inside the
 * sandbox. A pattern that reads the space through `wish()` would leave that
 * content there, which is exactly the case a synthetic-input argument does not
 * cover.
 *
 * Deleting what the probe creates was the alternative, and it was rejected for
 * a reason worth recording: a root-path retract does remove a document, but
 * the probe's settle produces derived documents beyond its piece and its
 * argument, and nothing here can enumerate them to establish that they are all
 * gone. That fix would have been "delete the ones we know about" presented as
 * "the leak is closed" — a narrower claim in a complete one's clothes, which
 * is the failure this gate exists to remove.
 *
 * So the boundary is structural. `StorageManager.emulate` holds everything in
 * memory, is never mounted anywhere, and is discarded on close: there is no
 * store for the probe to leak into rather than a cleanup that has to be got
 * exhaustively right.
