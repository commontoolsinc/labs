/**
 * Everything one session sends to the pattern index: the patterns it authored,
 * and the events its runs report about the patterns they ran.
 *
 * Each write is sent behind the one sent before it, and no caller waits for
 * any of them. So the index sees this session's writes in the order they were
 * sent — a dependency before the entry naming it, a run's `instantiated`
 * before the terminal event that follows it — while what a session contributes
 * to a shared catalog costs the run that contributed it nothing. A publication
 * is held rather than sent when it is staged, for the reason below.
 *
 * `flush` is the session's one wait for all of it. The harness process ends
 * through `Deno.exit`, which does not let a pending request finish, so a write
 * nothing waits for is a write that can be cut off in flight; the prompt loop
 * reaches `flush` before the process gets there. Nothing bounds that wait: a
 * session whose index has stopped answering ends when its last request does.
 *
 * ## The problem holding a publication exists for
 *
 * A pattern-author that iterates runs the same capability three or four times
 * before it is happy. Each successful run published, and since the source
 * differs slightly between iterations each is a different content-addressed
 * identity, so none deduplicates against the others. About a third of the
 * index is that: near-duplicates produced by iteration rather than by use,
 * several of which occupy consecutive slots in one search and crowd
 * everything else out of it.
 *
 * ## What it does instead
 *
 * Every iteration is still RECORDED — nothing an authoring session produced
 * is lost, and `getPattern` and `cf:pattern:` answer for all of it. The
 * request decides whether the retained candidate is discoverable; ordinary
 * authored runs record it, while curated seeding requests discoverability.
 *
 * A staged request is held. Staging the same capability again publishes the
 * one being displaced immediately, as `discoverable: false`, and holds the
 * new one. What is still held when the session ends is published with the
 * discoverability the caller requested. So a session that authored a
 * capability four times leaves four records and at most one search result.
 *
 * A staged request naming a held entry among its `dependencies` publishes
 * that dependency first, with its requested discoverability, since it is not
 * being superseded — the index refuses a publication whose dependency it does
 * not hold, so a
 * session composing an atom it authored earlier needs that atom in the index
 * before the composite arrives. An entry published that way becomes the
 * `priorPatternId` of the next iteration staged under the same capability,
 * which is the one case where two entries from one session both reach the
 * index through the front door.
 *
 * ## What this costs, stated rather than discovered
 *
 * **A session that dies before its flush loses the latest iteration of each
 * capability it was still holding** — one entry per capability, not the
 * session's whole output, since every superseded iteration was already sent
 * when it was displaced. A publication that fails at the index is logged and
 * does not bear on the run.
 *
 * **Two different capabilities described in identical words collapse**, the
 * later one taking the retained slot and the earlier being recorded. The
 * key is the model's own description and hashtags, which is also what the
 * index ranks a search against — so two entries this key cannot tell apart
 * are two entries a search cannot tell apart either.
