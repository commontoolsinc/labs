/**
 * Composition: making the published patterns a program imports resolvable
 * before it compiles, without any of their source passing through the
 * conversation.
 *
 * A model composes a published pattern by naming it —
 * `import Sub from "cf:pattern:<patternId>"`, exactly the specifier
 * `search_patterns` hands back. The compiler resolves that specifier from the
 * source-document closure the space holds under `pattern:<identity>`, and for
 * a pattern this space has never run there is no such closure. This module is
 * what puts one there: it reads the imported ids off the program, fetches each
 * one from the index on the trusted host side, and compiles it into the space
 * so its closure is durable by the time the importer's own compile asks for
 * it.
 *
 * Everything here runs host-side. A fetched program reaches the compiler and
 * stops; the errors raised for it name ids and never quote source.
