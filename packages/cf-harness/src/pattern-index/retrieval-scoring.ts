/**
 * Scoring for the pattern index's retrieval quality: given a labelled query
 * set and what `searchPatterns` actually ranked for each query, how good was
 * the answer.
 *
 * The scoring lives apart from the script that fetches, because the
 * interesting judgements here are arithmetic on labels and want to be tested
 * without a network. `scripts/score-retrieval.ts` is the caller.
 *
 * Three decisions worth stating, because a reader will otherwise assume the
 * usual ones:
 *
 *   * **`partial` is not relevant.** An entry with the right subject and the
 *     wrong behaviour — a static picture of a tracker where a tracker was
 *     asked for — is scored as a miss and counted separately as MISLEADING.
 *     Partial credit would report the corpus as half-answering a need that
 *     nothing in it answers, which is the failure this instrument exists to
 *     find.
 *   * **Two cut-offs, because the tool has two.** `search_patterns` reports
 *     ten hits to the model but fetches declared shapes only for the first
 *     five, so a hit at rank 7 reaches the model without the argument and
 *     result types it would need to wire the thing in. Ranks 6-10 are scored
 *     as `buried` rather than as found.
 *   * **Hit rate leads, not mean precision.** The decision a session makes is
 *     reuse or rebuild, and one answering entry at a readable rank settles
 *     it. Precision is reported too, but a mean over queries hides the
 *     individual failures, so every failure is also emitted by name.
