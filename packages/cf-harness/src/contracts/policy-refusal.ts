 * about one tool result, refusal or not, which is what a policy-trace decision
 * carries when a label rather than an authority decided the outcome.
 *
 * They sit in `contracts/` rather than in the tool that mints them because
 * they are one representation with two readers: the tool that measured the
 * boundary writes them onto its output, and the prompt loop appends them to
 * `policy-trace.json` as decisions. A release site the runner comes to own
 * — the model-context sink resolver — writes the same two shapes.
