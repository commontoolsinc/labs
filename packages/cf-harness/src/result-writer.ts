/**
 * The agent result writer: the trusted host routine that puts a run's
 * structured result into the fabric and returns a link to it.
 *
 * The harness is what knows what the model observed and what each handle in
 * the answer stands for, so the harness writes the result itself, from its
 * host-side fabric session, and nothing downstream re-labels or re-validates
 * it. Every handle the result names at a value position becomes a link,
 * `asCell` position or not; a property name is held to the same ownership
 * rule and stays the text it is, since a name cannot hold a link. A
 * handle to a cell becomes a link to that cell, so a consumer's read resolves
 * the cell's own label; a handle to a referent that is not a cell — a Loom
 * row, a SQLite row — becomes a document holding that content under the
 * label the tool reported, and a link to it. A handle the run does not hold
 * fails the write before anything is written (AH-REF-2). What the model
 * authored stays inline, and its label is the join the writing transaction
 * DERIVES: before the write, the host reads every cell the run observed
 * through that transaction, so the runtime's own flow derivation stamps the
 * real consumed set. The write is attributed to the `agent` builtin so the
 * result carries the runtime-minted `LlmDerived` family a pattern cannot
 * forge.
 *
 * This is not a model tool. It runs on the trusted host over the session's
 * runtime, after a run reaches its structured result, and every runtime gate
 * applies to its write (AH-TOOL-7).

/**
 * Writes `structuredResult` into the session's space and returns a link to
 * the document, the label it carries, and the documents minted on the way.
 *
 * Two transactions are committed. The first mints a document for every
 * non-cell referent the run observed, under the label the tool reported and
 * with no read beside it, so the declaration is the whole of what the
 * document carries. The second reads every observed cell and every minted
 * document, is attributed to the `agent` builtin, and writes the result
 * through the result schema with the `LlmDerived` stamp on every node and
 * `maxConfidentiality` declared as the store's policy at its root. Minting
 * in the same transaction as the reads would put the join on the minted
 * documents too, and a row's document should carry the row's label alone.
 *
 * Every reference is resolved, and every position ceiling measured, before
 * the first transaction opens, so a result naming a handle the run does not
 * hold writes nothing.
 *
 * @throws AgentResultWriteError naming what refused the write.
