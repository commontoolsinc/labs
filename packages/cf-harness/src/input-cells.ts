/**
 * Input cells: references supplied by the operator or retained from a
 * completed session turn that named a piece. They exist in the fabric before
 * the run starts. Each becomes a handle-table entry at run start. The handle
 * names a cell to a model that cannot hold addresses, so the run's
 * inputs reach the model as tokens from its first turn. The values stay in
 * their cells; what the model receives is a token and the host-supplied
 * name for it. This is the calling convention the CT-2066 demonstration
 * rests on — a prompt that never holds a literal value cannot inline one by
 * accident, and cannot pass one on by accident either.
 *
 * Like a well-known grant, an input cell discloses nothing by itself: the
 * address stays trusted-side in the handle table, `describe_handle` answers
 * shape, and reading anything behind the token means running a pattern over
 * it. An input cell names a task target, so
 * one that cannot be minted — an unparseable reference, or one targeting
 * another space — fails the run out loud rather than proceeding without it.
 *
 * A cell may also be named the way a person sees it named — a piece's slug,
 * alone or qualified by its space — and the session resolves that name to an
 * address before minting. A surface holding a rendered piece holds its name
 * and not the id behind it, so the alternative to resolving here is every such
 * surface deriving fabric ids of its own, which is one copy of the runtime's
 * addressing rules per client.
