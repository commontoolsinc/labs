/**
 * Task pattern references: published patterns the caller attaches to a task
 * by id, the way `--input-cell` attaches a cell by reference. A pattern id is
 * the content-addressed identity of published source, so the id itself
 * discloses nothing and asserts nothing — it either names an entry the index
 * holds or it names nothing at all.
 *
 * The run resolves each id against the index before its first model turn and
 * seeds what comes back as a searched hit, so `run_pattern`'s `patternId` and
 * `delegate_task`'s `patternRefs` name the pattern with no search. What the
 * reference grants is what a search hit grants: compose this source by
 * identifier. It is provenance, not endorsement — the record carries the
 * index's own account of the pattern, and attaching one adds nothing to it.
 *
 * Like an input cell, a reference is explicit caller configuration, so
 * failure is closed and loud: an id the index does not know fails the run
 * rather than leaving it to proceed without what the caller attached.
