 * resolves to a collection, which is a thing a person opens, so assigning
 * over it would take the address away from whoever holds it.
 *
 * `unknown` is a failure to establish anything: a storage error, a sync that
 * never landed, a lost connection. `invalid` sits there too — the slug was
 * validated before this is asked, so a resolver calling it unusable means the
 * two disagree about the rule rather than that the space is empty.
 *
 * The map is total over the code union, so a code added to the resolver does
 * not compile until it is classified here. Totality is the point: only
 * `inside-piece` can reach this from an address with no path, and
 * `missing-member` is classified because it belongs to the same answer, not

 * Whether `slug` already names a piece in the session's space — and which —

 *
 * Assignment refuses a name that is already bound, so this asks first for a
 * different reason than the write does. The write's rule is "bound at all";
 * this one is "names a piece or a collection a person opens", and a name
 * whose document holds no usable redirect competes with nothing. Asking here
 * is what lets the refusal name which of the two it is.
 *
 * The answer is carried into the write as `takeFrom` rather than forced over
 * whatever is there. Forcing would spend the claim the assignment makes: two
 * calls that both read this name as free would both take it, and one would
 * overwrite the other silently — the very race the claim closes. Handing the
 * binding this rule was judged against to the transaction keeps the rule and
 * the claim at once, so a name bound under this call is refused by the write
 * even though this read called it free.
 *
 * That also makes an unanswered question a refusal rather than a "free": a
 * resolution that failed operationally says nothing about what the slug
 * holds, and treating it as vacancy would repoint a name this side never
 * established was free.
 *
 * The outcomes are told apart by the typed `code` `resolvePieceAddress`
