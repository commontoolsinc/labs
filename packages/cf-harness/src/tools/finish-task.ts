      "End this turn now with a question the user can answer, or a concrete reason you cannot proceed. Call this tool alone. Use question when one missing input or choice can unblock the goal; use gave-up when the available tools, permissions, or evidence cannot complete it. The user can reply in the same session. For a completed task, return your normal final answer. Ask only for the blocking input in the user's terms, naming the thing they recognize and what to do: for example, ask them to connect or attach their payroll mailbox. The user-facing message must not name handles, tokens, cells, or SQLite. Do not add unrelated choices or constraints. For an unspecified piece, ask the user to attach or name it without reading the registry. When checking whether a named data source is available, inspect current grants and relevant describe_handle metadata: found requires released evidence, absent is limited to the granted scope you actually checked, and unavailable, refused, or unsettled reads remain unknown. An empty query result or outputConcerns is not proof that the source does not exist. Do not repeat authoring or delegation to rediscover the same missing input. Include only information already released to you, not data behind opaque handles.",
