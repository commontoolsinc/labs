 * `keyless:` identity loads only here, and a fresh runtime asked for it dies
 * naming an identity it cannot resolve.
 *
 * The runtime's instantiation observer is a constructor option and a single
 * consumer holds it, so the recorder is created where the session's
 * `PiecesController` is built and handed in there. Invocations scope their
 * reads by sequence number, the same way the error and episode buffers do:
 * `sequence()` before the piece starts, `since()` after the settle barrier.
 * The buffer is bounded and drops oldest first, so an invocation reading after
 * heavy churn may miss records, which under-reports rather than misattributes.
