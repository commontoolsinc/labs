 * The label snapshot for one run: every reference it held, resolved to the

 *
 * A reference that names no document is dropped rather than recorded empty —
 * it addresses nothing this reader can ask about, and an empty record would
 * read as a cell the space holds no label for. A reference into another
 * space does address a cell, so it is recorded and marked unread instead of
 * dropped: the run held it, and a reader that saw it vanish would take the
 * snapshot to cover every cell the run touched. So is a reference the store
 * holds no document for, and a store holding none of the cells a run wrote
 * is a store the run did not write into — said out loud, because the file
 * the search found is the likeliest thing to be wrong and the snapshot alone
 * cannot say so. A link the walk could not follow is the same, held as an
 * unread path at the path it sat at, as is a path it sat too shallow to
 * reach. A walk that ran out of nodes names no path — it stopped before
 * enumerating what it had left — so it marks the whole cell truncated
 * instead. Every other failure lands on the snapshot as a whole, so a reader
 * can tell "no labels" from "not read".
