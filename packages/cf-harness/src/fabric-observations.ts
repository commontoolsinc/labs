/**
 * What the fabric session's runtime reported while a `run_pattern`
 * invocation settled: action errors attributed to a piece, and
 * convergence-budget episodes in which the scheduler deferred actions after
 * exhausting a pass's budget. `run_pattern` reads these to name the cause
 * when a piece it created settles to an empty or schema-failing result. A
 * commit the CFC boundary refuses is terminal and arrives on the error
 * channel as a `CfcCommitRefusalError` naming the refusal; the episode
 * buffer covers the shapes that still defer — a reactive cycle, a
 * non-idempotent computation.
 *
 * One observer is installed per runtime, memoized, because the scheduler's
 * `onError` registry has no removal — a per-invocation subscription would
 * leak a handler per call. Invocations scope their reads by sequence number
 * instead: `sequence()` before the piece starts, `errorsSince`/
 * `episodesSince` after the settle barrier. Both buffers are bounded and drop
 * oldest first; an invocation that reads after heavy churn may therefore
 * miss records, which under-reports causes rather than misattributing them.
