/**
 * The posture record for the run's Fabric session, and how a surface renders
 * it.
 *
 * The session's Runtime is built lazily — on the first `run_pattern` call, if
 * one ever comes — while the two surfaces that publish its posture speak
 * earlier than that: the run state is written when the run starts, and the
 * console prints its posture when it binds its port. Neither can read a
 * constructed Runtime, so both project one, through the same preset
 * resolution and the same default table the Runtime itself resolves from
 * (`presetCfcOptions` and `resolveCfcDials` in the runner). A projection that
 * restated either in its own words would be a second answer to the question
 * the record exists to have one answer to.

 * bundle, then the host dials over both — is what decides the values, and
 * whatever the preset leaves unset resolves through the Runtime's dial
 * defaults.
 *
 * A PROJECTION, and the record says so. Two things it cannot promise. The
 * session may never be built at all — nothing constructs one until the first
 * `run_pattern` — and a host may supply its own session factory
 * (`fabricSessionFactory`), whose runtime this config does not describe. So a
 * reader gets a claim about what the run expected to be at, never an
 * attestation of what a runtime was at. Re-stamping the record from the real
 * runtime once one exists is what would make it the second thing.
