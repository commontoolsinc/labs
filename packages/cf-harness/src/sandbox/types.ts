/**
 * One transport's reading.
 *
 * `unregistered` says no valid absolute value occurs for the flag — absent,
 * empty, or relative, and runsc refuses a non-absolute one — so nothing reads
 * the harness's directory. It refuses under enforcement.
 *
 * `unsafe-runtime-arguments` says the runtime argument list contains a
 * character outside the conservative allowlist the readiness check trusts.
 * Moby shell-parses that list before runsc sees it, so its raw meaning cannot
 * be affirmed. It carries the first offending argument and its unsafe
 * characters, and refuses under enforcement without collapsing into
 * `unregistered`.
 *
 * `registered` says a valid absolute directory is registered, and carries
 * which one. It is deliberately not a claim that the directory is the one the
 * harness writes to, and not a claim that the transport works. Comparing the
 * two spellings cannot establish either: Docker resolves bind paths on the
 * daemon's host, symlinks and case-insensitive projections make two spellings
 * one directory, and `runtimes` is SIGHUP-reloadable. The registered path
 * travels with the status instead, so an operator can see that it differs
 * without this check pretending that seeing it differ is knowing it differs.
 * Affirming the transport needs an end-to-end proof — a sentinel written by
 * the harness and read back from inside the sandbox — which this reading is
 * not.
 *
 * `indeterminate` is the absence of any reading. Folding it into `unregistered`
 * refuses a host whose registration could not be read; folding it into
 * `registered` excuses a broken one.
 *
 * The word each status carries is what survives: these travel on the wire into
 * `policy-snapshot.json`, where no doc comment follows them, and a reader who
 * meets one there has only the word.
