 * allowlist is a property of the RUN — it is what `--allow-skill-script`
 * writes, and the operator decides before any acquisition happens — while a
 * child's tool surface is a property of its PROFILE. Neither reaches the other
 * on its own, so a child would hold a mounted skill with no tool to run a
 * script and no entry naming one.
 *
 * Narrowed to the pin: the operator decided about that skill's scripts and no
 * others, and a delegation carries one `skillHandle`, so one pin is the whole
 * of what this child was given. A run whose allowlist names none of its scripts
 * grants nothing, and the child's surface is its profile's, unchanged.
 *
 * `pinMismatch` separates that from the one case where granting nothing is a
 * mistake rather than a decision. An entry naming this same skill at a
 * DIFFERENT commit is an operator who allowed these scripts and an acquisition
 * that fetched other bytes — the repository's default branch moved between the
 * entry being written and the skill being acquired. The child would receive no
 * tool, which reads exactly like an operator who allowed nothing, so the two
 * commits are reported and the caller says so instead.
