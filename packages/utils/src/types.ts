/**
 * Type predicates over the general shape of a value.
 *
 * The predicates here come in two kinds, and the difference is visible at the
 * call site. One kind tests an exact `typeof` class -- `isString()`,
 * `isNumber()`, `isFunction()` -- and says everything there is to say about the
 * value, so its `false` branch is exactly as trustworthy as its `true` branch.
 *
 * The other kind is *structural*: `isObjectNotArray()`, `isPlainObject()` and
 * `isPlainContainer()` here, and `isInertArray()`,
 * `isArrayWithOnlyIndexProperties()`, and `isInertPlainObject()` in the sibling
 * `arrays` and `objects` modules. Each of
 * those checks strictly more than the type it narrows to can express, and
 * deliberately so: each narrows to the weakest type that stays true however the
 * value is treated afterwards, never to the property it actually checks. A
 * prototype can be reassigned and a property redefined, so "is `Object`-rooted"
 * or "is inert" describes an instant rather than a type, and a narrowed type
 * that claimed it would go on claiming it after it stopped being so.
 *
 * The narrowed types are read-only for the same reason. A frozen value is the
 * ordinary case here, and a predicate narrowing to a mutable `unknown[]` would
 * hand a caller holding `unknown` a writable view of one, there being no
 * `readonly` on the declared type for the result to inherit.
 * `isPlainContainer()` is the deliberate exception on both counts: it narrows
 * to mutable types, which claim more than it checks, because its callers are
 * the ones that go on to write through the result. The residual hazard is its
 * own: a caller passing `unknown` gets a writable view of what may be a frozen
 * container, with nothing at compile time to say so.
 *
 * A structural predicate is therefore *one-directional*: its `false` branch
 * means "not established", not "the negation holds". TypeScript cannot be told
 * this, because narrowing a `false` branch is subtraction and the language has
 * no negated types. Left to itself it would subtract the narrowed type from the
 * declared one, so a caller already holding a type at least as specific as what
 * the predicate narrows to would find the `false` branch reduced to `never` --
 * a value the check rejected, for a reason the type system never recorded.
 *
 * Each structural predicate heads this off with a pair of overloads. A caller
 * who already knows the broad shape gets a plain `boolean` and keeps both
 * branches; a caller holding `unknown` or `object`, who has no such type to
 * lose, gets the narrowing. Keeping the `false` branch usable is the whole of
 * what the first overload buys, and the only reason it is there. It is not what
 * protects a `readonly` declaration; the read-only narrow targets do that
 * unaided. A declared type that is already read-only is assignable to such a
 * target, so narrowing keeps it exactly as it was -- element and property types
 * included -- and it goes on rejecting writes. Against a *mutable* target it
 * would not be assignable, and TypeScript would intersect the two instead: the
 * resulting `readonly number[] & unknown[]` accepts writes, which is how a
 * mutable target launders `readonly` away.
 *
 * ## Every object-shape predicate answers the array question in its name
 *
 * `typeof [] === "object"`, so a predicate named only for "object" leaves a
 * reader guessing whether an array passes it, and a reader who guesses wrong
 * writes the wrong branch. Each name below settles the question in its own
 * final word. They are listed loosest test first, each accepting a subset of
 * what the one above it accepts:
 *
 * * `isObjectOrArray()` -- any non-`null` value whose `typeof` is `"object"`.
 *   Arrays, `Date`s, `Map`s, other class instances, and null-prototype objects
 *   all pass.
 * * `isObjectNotArray()` -- the same question with arrays removed. Class
 *   instances still pass.
 * * `isPlainObject()` -- rooted at `Object.prototype`, or at `null` unless the
 *   caller asks for the narrower question. Class instances do not pass.
 * * `isInertPlainObject()`, in the sibling `objects` module -- rooted at
 *   `Object.prototype` exactly, with every own property an enumerable
 *   string-keyed data property.
 *
 * Two more sit outside that chain. `isPlainContainer()` is `isPlainObject()`
 * widened to admit arrays again, for a caller whose next move is member access
 * by property name or by array index. `isInstance()` is the complement of the
 * plain objects among the non-array ones: a prototype that is neither
 * `Object.prototype` nor `null`.
 *
 * What a predicate narrows to is a separate matter from what its name says.
 * `isObjectOrArray()` narrows to `Record<string, unknown>`, and an array
 * satisfies that as far as reading a property by name goes. The name is what
 * tells a caller an array can be the thing it is now holding; the type does
 * not.
 *
 * `@commonfabric/data-model` asks the first of these questions of a value the
 * type system already says is a `FabricValue`, and spells it
 * `isFabricObjectOrArray()` for the same reason.

 *
 * * `__proto__` cannot be rebuilt by the copying this system actually does.
 *   Records are reconstructed by assignment (`target[key] = value`) and
 *   `Object.assign()`, and for this name both reach `Object.prototype`'s
 *   accessor instead of creating a property: the value is dropped, and the
 *   copy's prototype is repointed as well when that value is an object or
 *   `null`. Faithful mechanisms do exist -- spread, `Object.fromEntries()`,
 *   `Object.defineProperty()`, and `JSON.parse()` all carry the name -- so
 *   what stands in the way is the copy loops, not JavaScript.
 * * `constructor` copies faithfully. It is reserved because other boundaries
 *   in this implementation already refuse it: the projection to native values
 *   drops it, and `FabricError` throws on it. Accepting it here would mean
 *   admitting a key that a later boundary discards without saying so.
 *
 * Both are therefore removable, by rebuilding the copy loops on a faithful
 * mechanism and revisiting the boundaries that filter these names. Until then
 * the reservation is what keeps a record from being corrupted in transit.
