/**
 * What a push and a pop cost, across the three states the stack can be in and
 * with and without a repeated object in play.
 *
 * The states are what make this more than one figure. `IndexTrackingStack`
 * operates by scanning while it is short, from an index once it has been
 * `ADD_INDEX_AT` entries tall, and by scanning again once it has come back
 * below `DROP_INDEX_BELOW`:
 *
 * | state | index | height while timed |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `scanning` | never built | below `ADD_INDEX_AT` |
 * | `crossed` | built, then dropped | below `DROP_INDEX_BELOW` |
 * | `indexed` | built | above `ADD_INDEX_AT` |
 *
 * `scanning` and `crossed` do the same work at the same height, so the two of
 * them meeting is what says the index was dropped rather than carried. No test
 * can say it, the drop changing no answer. `indexed` is what a deep graph
 * pays.
 *
 * The `oscillating` group is what says the two marks are far enough apart. A
 * stack swinging inside either mark neither builds nor drops; only one
 * swinging across the whole gap rebuilds, and that band is here to be watched
 * rather than because it is expected.
 *
 * A repeated object is measured separately throughout, because it is what the
 * index has to record per object rather than as a single number: a push adds a
 * position to an existing entry rather than making one, and a pop takes a
 * position off rather than removing the entry.
 *
 * Every case times a batch of operations of one kind, and nothing else. The
 * scaffolding -- the state each stack has to be brought to, and the pushes a
 * pop batch needs -- is built outside the timed region.
 *
 * That is why an iteration works over a pool of stacks rather than one. Deno
 * ignores `start()` and `end()` for an iteration averaging under 10 us, and a
 * batch small enough to stay inside the `crossed` state's height band is far
 * under that on its own -- so the figure would silently become the scaffolding
 * plus the batch, which is a different measurement and a much larger one.
 * Running the batch against `POOL` stacks puts the timed region well past the
 * threshold while leaving each stack inside its band.
 *
 * Run with:
 *
 *     deno task bench
