/**
 * A memo cache keyed in two levels, with both levels held weakly.
 *
 * The outer key groups entries; the inner key identifies a value within that
 * group. Both levels are WeakMaps, so a whole group is collected once its outer
 * key is unreachable, and an individual entry is collected once its inner key is
 * unreachable while the group is still alive.
 *
 * The TypeScript pipelines use this to memoize a fact derived from a `ts.Type`
 * or AST node — a type's cell brand, a call's kind — against the
 * `ts.TypeChecker` that owns it. The fact depends only on the inner key's shape
 * within its checker, so keying by the checker first keeps a value from ever
 * being read against a foreign checker.
 *
 * Stored values may be `undefined`. Presence is tracked with `WeakMap.has`, so a
 * computed `undefined` is cached and not recomputed.
