/**
 * Array-predicate Performance Benchmarks
 *
 * `isInertArray()` is called once per array node by the fabric membership,
 * cloning, and conversion walks, so its cost is paid per container rather than
 * once per operation; `isArrayWithOnlyIndexProperties()` is its cheaper
 * key-shape-only companion. Every case runs both side by side: the spread
 * between them is the price of the per-index descriptor walk that inertness
 * checking adds, and it is worth watching over time, not just judging once.
 * Three properties are worth tracking:
 *
 * 1. **Absolute cost against array length.** Asking an array for its own keys
 *    scales with `length`, not with how many elements are actually present:
 *    measured on V8, a two-element array costs about 1 µs at `length` 1000 and
 *    about 700 µs at `length` 1e6. A sparse array is therefore priced by its
 *    extent, which is worth knowing before treating sparseness as free. The
 *    descriptor walk, by contrast, scales with elements *present*, so the
 *    inert/index-only spread collapses on sparse arrays.
 *
 * 2. **The plain/proxied split.** These two go in opposite directions, so a
 *    single number is misleading. `Reflect.ownKeys()` does not get the
 *    EnumCache fast path that `Object.keys()` gets on an ordinary array, which
 *    costs it there. On a `Proxy` it wins instead: `Object.keys()` fires an
 *    `ownKeys` trap plus a `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` trap per key to filter
 *    for enumerability, where `Reflect.ownKeys()` fires exactly one trap. The
 *    runtime proxies heavily, so the proxied figure is not a curiosity. For
 *    `isInertArray()` a proxy also pays one `getPrototypeOf` trap for the
 *    directness check, plus one `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` trap per index.
 *
 * 3. **The inert/index-only spread itself.** Per-index
 *    `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()` allocates a descriptor object per
 *    key; an engine could in principle optimize the `"value" in d` probe
 *    pattern, so a narrowing spread is news about the engine.
 *
 * Engines retune as usage shifts, so treat a large move here as news about the
 * engine rather than as noise.
