/**
 * Byte-Ownership Performance Benchmarks
 *
 * `toOwnedUint8Array()` is how a value that promises an immutable byte
 * sequence gets bytes it can rely on, so its cost is paid once per such value
 * constructed. Each size runs three arms side by side, and it is the spread
 * between them that carries the information:
 *
 * - `share` allocates the source and does nothing else. It is the floor: what
 *   the caller would pay if a holder simply kept the caller's array, taking on
 *   trust what this function enforces. Every arm pays it, so the amount by
 *   which the other two exceed it is the price of that enforcement.
 * - `copy` is the default, and what a caller pays when it keeps its array.
 * - `transfer` is what a caller that cedes its array pays instead.
 *
 * Three properties are worth tracking:
 *
 * 1. **The crossover between `copy` and `transfer`.** `transfer()` moves a
 *    buffer in constant time while a copy is linear in length, so the two
 *    converge as the payload shrinks and diverge as it grows. At digest size
 *    they are near enough to a tie that the choice does not matter; by 1 MiB
 *    the gap is the whole point of offering `transfer` at all. Watch where the
 *    lines cross, because that is what decides whether ceding is worth a call
 *    site's attention.
 *
 * 2. **The floor's share of the total.** At 32 bytes most of what any arm
 *    costs is allocating the source and its wrapper, not moving bytes. That is
 *    why enforcement is not free even for a digest, and why the enforced cost
 *    barely responds to which strategy is chosen.
 *
 * 3. **The absolute cost at 32 bytes.** Digest-sized values are constructed
 *    on hot paths, and at that size the cost is a flat per-construction
 *    addition rather than anything proportional to the work around it. It is
 *    therefore the figure that turns into a percentage of some caller's total,
 *    and the smaller that caller's own work, the larger the percentage.
 *
 * Every arm allocates its own source, because `transfer()` detaches and so
 * cannot be handed the same array twice. At 1 MiB that allocation dominates
 * the absolute numbers; the differences remain meaningful, the totals less so.
