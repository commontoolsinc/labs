/**
 * `deepEqualKey()` against the one property a caller relies on: deeply equal
 * values share a key. A caller groups by the key and then compares within the
 * group, so a pair that keys apart is never compared at all — a value that
 * escapes its group is a duplicate silently kept, with no failure anywhere to
 * say so.
 *
 * The corpus below is checked pairwise, every value against every other, so
 * the property is tested over the traps rather than over a chosen list of
 * them: key order in a record and in an array's named properties, `NaN`,
 * `-0`, sparse arrays, a property holding `undefined` against an absent one,
 * and a null-prototype object against a plain one.
