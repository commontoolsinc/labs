Focus on the simplest implementation that works with the provided schema.\n\n<task>\nGiven a user's feature request and an existing data schema, you will:\n1. Create a short title (2-5 words) that names the artifact\n2. Create a one-sentence description in the format \"A <artifact> to <goal>\"\n3. Create a concise specification (3-5 sentences max) that works with the existing schema\n4. Generate a brief implementation plan (3 steps max)\n5. Design a minimal JSON schema that represents the core data model\n</task>\n\n<output_structure>\nYour response must be structured as follows:\n\n<thinking>Freeform reasoning for you to consider the solution.</thinking>\n\n<title>\n[Short title for the artifact, 2-5 words]\n</title>\n\n<description>\n[One-sentence description in the format \"A <artifact> to <goal>\"]\n</description>\n\n<spec>\n[Concise specification that captures only the essential requirements]\n</spec>\n\n<plan>\n[Brief 3-step implementation plan using the existing schema]\n</plan>\n\n<result_schema>\n[Minimal JSON Schema in valid JSON format that represents data created by the artifact]\n</result_schema>\n</output_structure>\n\n<schema_guidelines>\n1. Keep it minimal:\n   - Include only essential fields (5-7 properties max)\n   - Focus on the core functionality\n   - If user requested complex features, simplify for this first version\n\n2. Each property should have:\n   - A descriptive \"title\" field\n   - A brief \"description\" field\n   - A sensible default value where appropriate\n\n3. Example of a simple schema:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"title\": \"Note List\",\n  \"description\": \"A simple note list for the user\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"notes\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"title\": \"Notes\",\n      \"description\": \"List of user notes\",\n      \"default\": [],\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"title\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"title\": \"Title\",\n            \"description\": \"Title of the note\",\n            \"default\": \"New Note\"\n          },\n          \"content\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"title\": \"Content\",\n            \"description\": \"Content of the note\"\n          },\n          \"created\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"format\": \"date-time\",\n            \"title\": \"Created Date\",\n            \"description\": \"When the note was created\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"title\", \"content\"]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"title\", \"content\"]\n}\n```\n\nGUIDELINES:\n- Aim for the simplest possible solution that works with the existing schema\n- The specification should take into account the existing schema structure\n- Focus on what can be achieved quickly with the existing data model\n- Avoid suggesting modifications to the schema if possible\n</schema_guidelines>\n\n<high_level>\nIMPORTANT:\n- Focus on the simplest working version\n- Aim for fewer fields rather than more\n- But still capture all the important state the user is creating\n- The user can always iterate and improve the solution later\n</high_level>\n",

The 2048 game is a sliding tile puzzle where players combine tiles with the same numbers to create a tile with the value 2048.\n\nKey components needed:\n1. Game board (typically a 4x4 grid)\n2. Tiles with values (powers of 2)\n3. Score tracking\n4. Game state (in progress, won, lost)\n5. Movement mechanics (up, down, left, right)\n6.

The game board as a 2D array (4x4)\n2. Current score\n3. Game state (playing, won, lost)\n4.

The game tracks the current score, which increases whenever tiles merge, and ends when no more moves are possible or when the 2048 tile is created.\n</spec>\n\n<plan>\n1.
