Focus on the simplest implementation that works with the provided schema.\n\n<task>\nGiven a user's feature request and an existing data schema, you will:\n1. Create a short title (2-5 words) that names the artifact\n2. Create a one-sentence description in the format \"A <artifact> to <goal>\"\n3. Create a concise specification (3-5 sentences max) that works with the existing schema\n4. Generate a brief implementation plan (3 steps max)\n5. Design a minimal JSON schema that represents the core data model\n</task>\n\n<output_structure>\nYour response must be structured as follows:\n\n<thinking>Freeform reasoning for you to consider the solution.</thinking>\n\n<title>\n[Short title for the artifact, 2-5 words]\n</title>\n\n<description>\n[One-sentence description in the format \"A <artifact> to <goal>\"]\n</description>\n\n<spec>\n[Concise specification that captures only the essential requirements]\n</spec>\n\n<plan>\n[Brief 3-step implementation plan using the existing schema]\n</plan>\n\n<result_schema>\n[Minimal JSON Schema in valid JSON format that represents data created by the artifact]\n</result_schema>\n</output_structure>\n\n<schema_guidelines>\n1. Keep it minimal:\n   - Include only essential fields (5-7 properties max)\n   - Focus on the core functionality\n   - If user requested complex features, simplify for this first version\n\n2. Each property should have:\n   - A descriptive \"title\" field\n   - A brief \"description\" field\n   - A sensible default value where appropriate\n\n3.

The 2048 game is a popular sliding tile puzzle game where players combine tiles with the same numbers to create a tile with the number 2048.\n\nKey components needed:\n1. Game board (typically a 4x4 grid)\n2. Tiles with numbers (powers of 2)\n3. Sliding mechanics (up, down, left, right)\n4. Score tracking\n5. Win/lose conditions\n6. Optional: High score tracking and game reset\n\nThe existing schema is empty, so I'll need to design a complete schema for this game. The schema should represent:\n- The game board state (a 2D grid)\n- Current score\n- Game status (in progress, won, lost)\n- High score (optional feature)\n\nFor the implementation plan, I'll focus on:\n1. Setting up the game board and initial state\n2. Implementing the core game mechanics (sliding and merging)\n3. Adding game status tracking and UI elements\n</thinking>\n\n<title>\n2048 Sliding Puzzle Game\n</title>\n\n<description>\nA game charm to play the classic 2048 sliding tile puzzle with score tracking.\n</description>\n\n<spec>\nThe 2048 game will feature a 4x4 grid where numbered tiles can be slid in four directions (up, down, left, right). When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values. The game tracks the current score based on merged tile values and determines win/lose conditions. The player wins upon creating a 2048 tile and loses when no more moves are possible.\n</spec>\n\n<plan>\n1. Create the game board with initial tiles (two random \"2\" or \"4\" tiles) and implement the UI grid display.\n2. Implement sliding mechanics in all four directions with tile merging logic and score calculation.\n3. Add game status tracking (in-progress, win, lose), high score persistence, and reset functionality.\n</plan>\n\n<result_schema>\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"title\": \"2048 Game State\",\n  \"description\": \"Represents the current state of a 2048 game\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"board\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"title\": \"Game Board\",\n      \"description\": \"4x4 grid representing the game board\",\n      \"default\": [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]],\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"array\",\n        \"items\": {\n          \"type\": \"integer\",\n          \"minimum\": 0\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"score\": {\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"title\": \"Current Score\",\n      \"description\": \"Player's current score in this game\",\n      \"default\": 0,\n      \"minimum\": 0\n    },\n    \"highScore\": {\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"title\": \"High Score\",\n      \"description\": \"Highest score achieved across all games\",\n      \"default\": 0,\n      \"minimum\": 0\n    },\n    \"gameStatus\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"title\": \"Game Status\",\n      \"description\": \"Current status of the game\",\n      \"enum\": [\"in-progress\", \"won\", \"lost\"],\n      \"default\": \"in-progress\"\n    },\n    \"moves\": {\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"title\": \"Moves Count\",\n      \"description\": \"Number of moves made in the current game\",\n      \"default\": 0,\n      \"minimum\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"board\", \"score\", \"gameStatus\"]\n}\n</result_schema>"
