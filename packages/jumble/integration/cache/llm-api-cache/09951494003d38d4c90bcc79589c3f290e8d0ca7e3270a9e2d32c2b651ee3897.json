Focus on the simplest implementation that works with the provided schema.\n\n<task>\nGiven a user's feature request and an existing data schema, you will:\n1. Create a short title (2-5 words) that names the artifact\n2. Create a one-sentence description in the format \"A <artifact> to <goal>\"\n3. Create a concise specification (3-5 sentences max) that works with the existing schema\n4. Generate a brief implementation plan (3 steps max)\n5. Design a minimal JSON schema that represents the core data model\n</task>\n\n<output_structure>\nYour response must be structured as follows:\n\n<thinking>Freeform reasoning for you to consider the solution.</thinking>\n\n<title>\n[Short title for the artifact, 2-5 words]\n</title>\n\n<description>\n[One-sentence description in the format \"A <artifact> to <goal>\"]\n</description>\n\n<spec>\n[Concise specification that captures only the essential requirements]\n</spec>\n\n<plan>\n[Brief 3-step implementation plan using the existing schema]\n</plan>\n\n<result_schema>\n[Minimal JSON Schema in valid JSON format that represents data created by the artifact]\n</result_schema>\n</output_structure>\n\n<schema_guidelines>\n1. Keep it minimal:\n   - Include only essential fields (5-7 properties max)\n   - Focus on the core functionality\n   - If user requested complex features, simplify for this first version\n\n2. Each property should have:\n   - A descriptive \"title\" field\n   - A brief \"description\" field\n   - A sensible default value where appropriate\n\n3.

The 2048 game is a popular sliding tile puzzle game where the goal is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048.\n\nThe core components needed for a 2048 game:\n1. A 4x4 grid to hold the tiles\n2. Tiles with numbers (powers of 2)\n3. Game mechanics for sliding and merging tiles\n4. Score tracking\n5. Win/lose condition detection\n6. Optional: high score persistence and game reset\n\nThe existing schema is empty, so I'll need to design a schema that can represent:\n- The game board (4x4 grid)\n- Current score\n- Game state (in progress, won, lost)\n- High score (optional)\n\nFor the implementation plan, I'll focus on:\n1. Setting up the game board and initial state\n2. Implementing the core game mechanics (sliding and merging)\n3.

When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values. The game tracks the current score based on merged tile values and detects win (reaching 2048) or lose (no more moves) conditions. A high score will be persisted between game sessions, and players can reset the game at any time.\n</spec>\n\n<plan>\n1. Create the game board representation with a 4x4 grid, initialize with two random tiles (value 2 or 4), and set up initial game state.\n2. Implement the core sliding and merging mechanics for all four directions, with proper tile generation after each move.\n3. Add score calculation, win/lose condition detection, high score tracking, and game reset functionality.\n</plan>\n\n<result_schema>\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"title\": \"2048 Game State\",\n  \"description\": \"Represents the current state of a 2048 game\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"board\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"title\": \"Game Board\",\n      \"description\": \"4x4 grid representing the game board\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"array\",\n        \"items\": {\n          \"type\": \"integer\",\n          \"minimum\": 0,\n          \"description\": \"Tile value (0 represents empty cell)\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"default\": [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0]\n      ]\n    },\n    \"score\": {\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"title\": \"Current Score\",\n      \"description\": \"Player's current score in this game\",\n      \"default\": 0,\n      \"minimum\": 0\n    },\n    \"highScore\": {\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"title\": \"High Score\",\n      \"description\": \"Highest score achieved across all games\",\n      \"default\": 0,\n      \"minimum\": 0\n    },\n    \"gameStatus\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"title\": \"Game Status\",\n      \"description\": \"Current status of the game\",\n      \"enum\": [\"in_progress\", \"won\", \"lost\"],\n      \"default\": \"in_progress\"\n    },\n    \"lastMove\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"title\": \"Last Move Direction\",\n      \"description\": \"Direction of the last move made\",\n      \"enum\": [\"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\", \"none\"],\n      \"default\": \"none\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"board\", \"score\", \"gameStatus\"]\n}\n</result_schema>"
