/**
 * The worker side of a DOM-event crossing: it decodes what the main thread
 * posted, does what the event ingress does with it, and acks.
 *
 * Under `fixtures/` rather than beside the benchmark because a file here is
 * neither a `*.bench.ts` nor a test, and the coverage tooling counts anything
 * else under `packages/` as source a suite failed to reach.
 *
 * The ack carries one boolean. What the benchmark wants to know is what the
 * send and this side's work cost, and a reply carrying any part of the received
 * event would put a second clone of it on the return leg and bury exactly that.
