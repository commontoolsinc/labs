// Sound read-label provenance via SQLite column-origin metadata.
//
// `@db/sqlite` returns rows keyed by the SELECT's OUTPUT column names, which is
// unsound for CFC labeling: `SELECT body AS x` hides a confidential column, and
// `SELECT subject AS from_email` spoofs another column's name. The bundled
// libsqlite3 is compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA, so we ask the
// engine for each result column's TRUE origin `(table, column)` via FFI on the
// prepared statement's `unsafeHandle`:
//   - alias  `from_email AS r`      -> origin (emails, from_email)   [resolved]
//   - spoof  `subject AS from_email`-> origin (emails, subject)      [defeated]
//   - expr   `upper(from_email)`    -> origin (null, null)           [fail closed]
//
// We are NOT switching SQLite implementations: this binds the SAME libsqlite3
// `@db/sqlite` already loaded (compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA). The
// origin symbols live in that lib but `@db/sqlite` doesn't expose them, so we
// `Deno.dlopen` its file to declare them. We pick that file the way `@db/sqlite`
// picks it, in its order: `DENO_SQLITE_LOCAL`, then `DENO_SQLITE_PATH`, then
// plug's `download({ cache: "use" })`, which on a cache hit just RETURNS the
// already-downloaded path (no network, no scanning). Exactly one of those is
// opened. Opening a file other than the one `@db/sqlite` opened would give the
// process a second libsqlite3 image, so a source that can't be opened reports
// why and leaves provenance unavailable. Resolution is async, so call
// `ensureColumnOriginAvailable()` once before issuing labeled queries;
// `columnOrigins()` then reads the memoized handle synchronously.

// a different file, and dlopen'ing that gives the process a second libsqlite3
// image instead of the one `@db/sqlite` loaded. Each image carries its own copy
// of SQLite's global state, and `@db/sqlite` calls `sqlite3_initialize()` only
// on the image it loaded, so a statement handle passed into the second image
// segfaults. Calling `sqlite3_initialize()` on the second image stops the crash
// and is not the repair: two initialized images still hold separate allocators
// and mutexes, and would then share handles. The requirement is one image, so
// both bindings must name one file. `deno test` in this package checks this
// version against the lockfile.
