// CFC Phase 3.c — server-side commit-time row-label re-derivation.
//
// A `sqlite` op folded into a commit executes inside `applyCommitTransaction`
// where no pattern code runs, so the per-row label rule (a pure declarative
// projection, `row-label.ts`) is the only thing that CAN check it. When the
// write's target table declares a `rowLabel` rule, this module executes the
// statement, reads the affected rows BACK BY ROWID, and runs the SHARED
// evaluator (`evaluateRowLabel` — the same one the write gate and read
// re-derivation use, so the sides cannot drift) against each TRUE committed
// row. Any rule-evaluation failure throws, rolling back the WHOLE commit
// (cell ops included — `applyCommit` runs in one transaction).
//
// This covers the write shapes the runner gate cannot attribute and previously
// failed closed on (INSERT…SELECT, upsert, columnless INSERT, UPDATE of a
// rule-input column): the committed row is the ground truth, whatever the
// statement's shape. The NO-LAUNDERING half of the write gate stays
// runner-side — the server sees only stored values, never the CFC labels
// carried by the writer's bound inputs, so "every labeled input is captured by
// the row's label" is only checkable where the labels live. The runner relaxes
// its shape rejects solely when the server advertises this evaluation
// (`MemoryProtocolFlags.sqliteCommitRowLabelEval`), and keeps them for labeled
// inputs regardless.
//
// The evaluation runs UNCONDITIONALLY server-side (not gated on the client's
// protocol flags): it is the server's own soundness enforcement, so a stale or
// hostile client cannot skip it by claiming an older protocol.
//
// Affected-row identification appends `RETURNING <rowid> AS __cf_rowid` to the
// statement (SQLite applies ALL of a RETURNING DML's changes on the first
// step; stepping to completion collects the rows) — but the label is evaluated
// against the READ-BACK row, not the RETURNING output, so RETURNING's
// same-statement-double-touch timing caveats cannot skew it. A statement that
// already carries RETURNING fails closed on a rule-bearing table (a second
// clause cannot be appended soundly — and `db.exec` returns void, so the
// clause had no consumer anyway).
//
// Trust note: `op.db.owner` (resolving the rule's `dbOwner()` term) is
// client-supplied, like the rest of the db ref. A forged owner can only turn
// an ABSENT owner into a present one — every structural failure the evaluator
// enforces (strict-if-present, `min` anchors, unique integrity subjects,
// malformed nodes) is owner-independent — and the read side re-resolves the
// owner from the handle cell, never from a writer's claim.
