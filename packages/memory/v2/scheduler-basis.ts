// The engine-side writer of the scheduler_basis index
// (docs/specs/server-side-execution/serving-loop.md §3b). The table is
// created by the engine schema (stage C.2's migration reduced the
// observation tables to it); this module is how a wave's commit step
// records "output current iff these inputs unchanged since these seqs"
// rows for recovery and warm start.
//
// The shape rules §3b binds are enforced here, not left to callers:
//
// - OVERWRITE IN PLACE, per (action, action_scope_key): one run's rows
//   REPLACE that instance's rows as a set. Appending beside a previous
//   run's rows is the evidence log's signature (§8), so the delete half
//   is not optional.
// - Ids + seqs ONLY: the row type carries no payloads and no paths; path
//   precision stays in the in-memory reactivity log.
// - CARRIAGE: the caller invokes this INSIDE the wave's derived store
//   transaction (the sink contract of the runner's wave accumulator, and
//   stage F's loopback commit step). Rows are engine table rows on that
//   transaction — never own commits, never pushed, never read at
//   admission (protocol.md §3, §7).
//
// Stage E feeds instance VALUES through this writer when it re-keys the
// vocabulary per scope instance (plan Phase 1 stage E); at OFF-arm
// cardinality 1 the keys derive from the runtime's own authenticated
// session.
