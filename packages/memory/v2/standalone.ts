/**
 * Standalone in-process memory v2 server.
 *
 * Serves the same websocket protocol (and `session.open` signature
 * verification) as toolshed's `/api/storage/memory` route, on an ephemeral
 * localhost port with a non-persistent store. Several runtimes — including
 * ones in Deno Workers or subprocesses — can share one storage backend
 * without a toolshed process. Used by multi-runtime test harnesses
 * (`cf test` multi-user mode, packages/patterns integration tests).
 *
 * A runtime addresses far more than storage at the host it is given: the
 * health probe every client opens with, the patterns route, the
 * language-model route, the blob routes. The health probe is answered here,
 * because this server is what occupies the address and so is what can say it
 * is up. The rest reach `serve`, and whatever the caller does not answer
 * there is told the one thing that is true of this address: it speaks the
 * memory websocket protocol, so upgrade. That is what a runtime asking a bare
 * storage host for a route it does not have hears, and it carries a status
 * that stops the answer being read as the thing that was asked for.
 *
 * Deno-only (uses `Deno.serve`); keep this export path out of browser
 * bundles.
