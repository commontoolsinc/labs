   *   DID (a user's home space — the demanded wish bootstrap's

   * - **creation**: the target store does not exist — §2b's sanctioned
   *   provisioning ("provision a foreign/NEW space"), where the
   *   creating commit is what makes it the actor's (CT-1650's
   *   deterministic per-user-per-event DIDs; quota attribution stays
   *   the recorded residual, README §3.8). Probed WITHOUT creating:
   *   the open-engine map first, then the store path — `openEngine`
   *   materializes a store as a side effect, which is exactly what an
   *   ungranted probe must not do.
   * - **acl**: the target's OWN ACL document grants the principal (or
   *   `ANYONE`) WRITE/OWNER — the same per-space grant structure the
   *   client session path enforces. Checked mode-independently: this
   *   gate is the serving plane's normative fail-closed interim
   *   (protocol.md §2's posture), not the client ACL rollout, so
   *   `acl.mode: "off"` does not disable it, the service-DID blanket
   *   (`#isServicePrincipal`) does NOT apply (resolving ambient
   *   service authority is the lunch-wall class), and the
   *   missing-ACL-populated-legacy compat arm does not apply either
   *   (fail closed; the per-DOC grant resolution stays OW13's owed
   *   hardening).
   *
