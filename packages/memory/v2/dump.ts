// Read-only, crash-consistent snapshots of space SQLite stores for offline
// autopsy (the `cf inspect --remote` workflow). This is the sanctioned way to
// extract a space's durable store over the wire:
//
//   * It never mutates the source DB — `VACUUM INTO` only reads the source and
//     writes a brand-new single-file copy.
//   * It never runs the engine's migration path (which DDLs the store on open);
//     we open `@db/sqlite` directly, the same read-only discipline the
//     state-inspector uses.
//   * It produces ONE consistent file even though the live server keeps the
//     store in WAL mode — `VACUUM INTO` checkpoints into the copy, so the result
//     has no `-wal`/`-shm` companions to ship.
//
// `store` here is the SAME value the toolshed hands `MemoryServer` (its
// `#store`). The server resolves each space's file via `resolveSpaceStoreUrl`,
// so we MUST resolve through the same helper rather than assuming files sit
// directly under `store` — directory mode nests them one more `engine-v3/` deep.
