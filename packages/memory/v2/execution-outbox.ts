// The durable half of the server-execution v2 outbox
// (docs/specs/server-side-execution/serving-loop.md §5, FP1 RULED
// 2026-08-03): cross-space event appends are engine-table rows written
// INSIDE the emitting wave's own store transaction — the basis-row
// carriage pattern, sanctioned in protocol.md §7 — and DELETED on
// delivery-ack: a queue that empties, never history, so the
// no-per-run-persistence lesson holds. A row carries the event (payload
// bounded by the event, never graph-scaled) plus the acting identity
// (`actingPrincipal` + `actingSession`) + `capabilityRef` that the
// target's admission validates and stamps `firedAt` from — actor
// inheritance crosses spaces through exactly this carriage (events.md
// §2, LT5: the delivery commit's ENVELOPE is the producing server's
// service identity; admissibility comes from the validated grant, never
// the envelope).
//
// Split of duties: the INSERT half is invoked by `applyWaveCommit`
// inside the wave's transaction (never its own commit); the SELECT and
// DELETE halves are the serving loop's outbox — re-send on activation
// (serving-loop.md §6 step 5) and retirement on delivery-ack are
// direct engine-table writes on the direct-engine plane (serving-loop.md
// §1 plane (c)). The EFFECT half of the outbox is process-local by
// design and never touches this table (serving-loop.md §4's FORBIDDEN
// "pending effects" table: on crash, missing effect results are
// re-missed from memo keys).
//
// The crash discipline the row order carries (the spec model's C2/FP1
// closure — no lost cross-space appends on any crash schedule): a row is
// deleted only AFTER the target's admission processed the entry. A crash
// between admit and delete re-sends the row; the duplicate dedupes at the
// target's `eventId` horizon (events.md §4 — uniqueness applies ONLY
// above the stream's `eventWatermark`; an at-or-below duplicate admits
// and is skipped at processing time).
