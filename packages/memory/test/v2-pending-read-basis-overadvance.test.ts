// CT-1910: the pending-read basis over-advance and its repair.
//
// The bug (recorded against INV-1 in docs/specs/memory-v2/09-invariants.md,
// machine-found by docs/specs/memory-v2/tla/PendingStacks_Current.cfg): the
// staleness scan for a LEGACY pending read starts at the highest
// dependency's resolution seq, so overlapping FOREIGN writes landing between
// the reader's confirmed basis and that seq are never scanned. The
// engine-level repro is the one verified in the PR #4606 review thread
// (2026-07-24), transcribed to the post-#4606 array-localSeq wire shape.
//
// The repair (`PendingStacks_Repaired.cfg` certifies it): a pending read
// that declares its true confirmed basis (`basisSeq`, in the SERVER's seq
// space) is scanned over the FULL interval (basisSeq, head], excluding the
// session's own accepted commits.
//
// The legacy-shape tests below deliberately assert the UNSOUND accept: they
// are the regression witness for why `basisSeq` exists (the same role the
// violated TLA config plays), and they document the deviation that persists
// for clients that do not declare a basis. The repaired-shape tests assert
// the same schedule is rejected once the basis is declared, that own-session
// exclusion prevents the self-conflict which historically forced the basis
// to over-advance, and the basisSeq validation surface.
