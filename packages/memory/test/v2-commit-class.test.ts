// Server-execution v2 stage A: every commit row carries a `class` —
// 'authored' | 'derived' | 'system', a closed set, determined by the
// admission path and never by any client-supplied value
// (docs/specs/server-side-execution/protocol.md §1). These tests pin the
// stage-A surface: the class is WRITTEN in every arm (no flag involved in
// stamping), `derived` is unclaimable off the flag (its ON-arm admission —
// the stage-B lease equality check — is covered in
// v2-execution-lease-test.ts), and a pre-class store migrates by backfilling
// 'authored'.
