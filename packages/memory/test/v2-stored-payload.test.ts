/**
 * The stored-payload rule is shared by two readers that accept different
 * payloads: the engine reads what it wrote, through `decodeMemoryBoundary`,
 * while an offline reader over a durable file may also meet untagged
 * plain-JSON rows. Everything either of them decides ABOUT a payload —
 * whether an absent one is readable, whether a decoded root is a document —
 * has to be the same on both sides, or the two disagree about which stored
 * states exist while claiming to replicate one another.
 *
 * So every case here runs under both decoders and asserts they agree. The
 * trap this guards is a rule that reaches its verdict by handing a fallback
 * STRING to the decoder: `decodeMemoryBoundary` refuses any untagged payload,
 * so a `"[]"` fallback rejects for the engine and succeeds for a plain-JSON
 * reader, and a rule that reads differently per decoder is not shared.
