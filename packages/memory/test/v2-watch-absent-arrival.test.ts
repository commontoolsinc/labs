/**
 * A session's watch must re-fire when a doc its query READ AS ABSENT is
 * later created — the arrival half of the ruled re-fire contract ("a
 * refusal-disposed read re-fires on a foreign writer's arrival through
 * its registered dead-end read alone", verification-coverage.md
 * OW51/OW45).
 *
 * Under server execution this is the FIRST-HYDRATION path: the server
 * materializes a piece a beat after the client learns its id, so the
 * client's first pull of a piece doc can evaluate before the birth
 * commit. The client legitimately never re-pulls — its selector tracker
 * records the pull as covered, and every later read is answered locally
 * — so the ONLY heal is this server-side re-fire. A creation flow ends
 * with a write followed by pure reads (the quiet-space tail), so a
 * watch that misses the birth starves every read of that doc for the
 * session's life while a fresh session reads it fine: the OW45 arm-B
 * starvation, store-verified zero-loss.
 *
 * Two shapes, one gate: the wake pass keys off `session.trackedIds`.
 * An absent watch ROOT enters it through its delivered seq-0 absence
 * marker; a link-HOP target the walk dead-ended on enters through the
 * graph state's MISS SET (`TrackedGraphState.missed`) — wake-reactivity
 * only, never delivered — and either way the birth commit passes the
 * touched check and `refreshTrackedGraph` delivers the real document.
 *
 * The waits await the watch view's own update stream — the delivery
 * event itself; a genuinely stuck delivery is the harness's
 * stuck-test detector's to diagnose.
