/**
 * Regression for the blind-`$value` write STRUCTURAL precondition (the
 * ancestor-shape check).
 *
 * A blind UI-input `set` drops the value-equality precondition on its write
 * target so it can't lose the own-write race. In its place, handleCellSet threads
 * the cell's PARENT address, which buildReads turns into one nonRecursive read.
 * This test pins WHY that read must be at the parent, not the entity root: it
 * exercises the exact race the parent read exists for — a stale nested patch
 * whose ANCESTOR was concurrently retyped (object -> scalar).
 *
 * - precondition-free: the patch replays onto the retyped base at
 *   commit-materialization and throws a raw "not traversable" (ungraceful; rolls
 *   back inside the commit's SQLite tx, so no durable corruption);
 * - an entity-ROOT structural read does NOT catch it (a TIER-2 patch that retypes
 *   an intermediate ancestor doesn't overlap a root read) — still a raw throw;
 * - the PARENT structural read (what handleCellSet threads) converts it into a
 *   clean ConflictError, which the conflict-recovery path handles gracefully.
 *
 * The in-process multi-runtime harness can't reproduce this end to end: it
 * propagates shared state synchronously, so a session can't hold a stale-but-
 * navigable replica (its navigation into the retyped ancestor fails locally
 * before any commit). Hence this engine-level test.
