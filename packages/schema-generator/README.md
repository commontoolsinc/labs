# @commonfabric/schema-generator

Short notes on the JSON Schema generator and ref/definitions behavior. The
canonical behavior reference is the mapping spec:
`docs/specs/schema-generator/ts_to_json_schema_mapping.md`; see also `AGENTS.md`
for the working guide.

## All‑Named Hoisting (default)

- Hoists every named type into `$defs` and emits `#/$defs/...` refs for non‑root
  occurrences.
- Excludes wrapper spellings and native leaf types from hoisting (the real rule
  is broader than a short name list — see `getNamedTypeKey`
  (`src/type-utils.ts`) and `src/typescript/wrapper-names.ts`; it covers all
  cell-wrapper spellings including `Writable`/`OpaqueCell`/`SqliteDb`, the
  native-type table, and generic instantiations).
- Root types remain inline unless recursion forces promotion to a `$ref`;
  `$defs` is included only if at least one ref is emitted.
- Unaliased type-literal shapes and generic alias instantiations are inlined; a
  non-generic named alias of a literal shape IS hoisted under the alias name
  (aliasSymbol fallback).
- `$ref` may appear with Common Fabric extensions as siblings (e.g.
  `{ "$ref": "#/$defs/Foo", asCell: ["stream"] }`).

Rationale: Improves human readability and re‑use of complex shared shapes while
keeping wrapper semantics explicit and simple.

Implementation: see `src/schema-generator.ts` (`formatType`) and
`src/type-utils.ts` (`getNamedTypeKey` filtering).

## Native Type Schemas

- Maps ECMAScript built-ins directly when they appear as properties:
  - `Date` → `{ type: "string", format: "date-time" }`
  - `URL` → `{ type: "string", format: "uri" }`
  - Typed array family (`Uint8Array`, `Uint8ClampedArray`, `Int8Array`,
    `Uint16Array`, `Int16Array`, `Uint32Array`, `Int32Array`, `Float32Array`,
    `Float64Array`, `BigInt64Array`, `BigUint64Array`) plus `ArrayBuffer`,
    `ArrayBufferLike`, `SharedArrayBuffer`, and `ArrayBufferView` → `true`
    (permissive JSON Schema leaf)
- These shortcuts keep schemas inline without emitting `$ref` definitions, while
  avoiding conflicts with array detection or hoisting, even when the compiler
  widens them via intersections or aliases.

## Function Properties

- Properties whose resolved type is callable or constructable are skipped
  entirely so we do not emit function shapes in JSON Schema output.
- Method signatures, declared methods, and properties whose type exposes call
  signatures are all filtered before we decide on `required` membership or emit
  attribute metadata (docs, default wrappers, etc.).
- This keeps schemas focused on serialisable data: JSON Schema cannot describe
  runtime function values, and downstream tooling expects objects, arrays, and
  primitives only.

Implementation: see `src/formatters/object-formatter.ts` and
`src/type-utils.ts:isFunctionLike`.

## Running

- Check typings: `deno task check`
- Run tests: `deno task test`
