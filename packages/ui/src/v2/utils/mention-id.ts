 * The id embedded in wiki-link mention text (`[[Name (<id>)]]`) is the BARE
 * tagged hash (`fid1:<hash>`): the text is persisted note content, and note
 * renderers (e.g. note-md) build `/of:<id>` links from it — so the `of:`
 * scheme is the renderer's to add, never the editor's to embed.
 * `CellHandle.id()` returns the full schemed URI, so embedding strips `of:`.
 *
 * `computed:` ids are REJECTED, not stripped: the URI scheme is part of the
 * identity — a computed cell's bare hash addresses its `of:` sibling — so a
 * computed cell cannot round-trip through the bare embed format. Today this
 * cannot occur (mentionable targets are pieces: result cells, always
 * `of:`-schemed), so the throw is a tripwire. If mentionables ever include
 * computed cells, the embed format must learn to carry the scheme instead —
 * e.g. persist the full URI inside the wiki-link and teach the renderers to
 * link schemed ids without re-prefixing.
