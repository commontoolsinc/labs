/**
 * CFSubmitInput - A text field with a submit button whose click carries the
 * typed text on the event itself.
 *
 * The submit button click is a real (trusted) DOM gesture that bubbles to this
 * host. A pattern wires `onClick` on the host and reads `event.target.value`:
 * the host mirrors the field's text in its `value` property, so the submitted
 * text rides the trusted click — together with the surrounding surface's UI
 * integrity (data-ui-action / data-ui-event-integrity on the host and an
 * ancestor). Because the text travels in the event, the consuming handler needs
 * no durable draft cell, and the field clears itself in the DOM after submit —
 * deferred past the click's handling so the value is read first, and guarded so
 * a back-to-back submit's freshly typed name is never wiped. This
 * keeps a cross-space create handler stable across retries — the event payload
 * is fixed — with nothing to clobber.
 *
 * Pressing Enter in the field submits as well. The field sits inside a `<form>`
 * holding a hidden native submit button, so Enter triggers the browser's
 * implicit form submission: the user agent fires a trusted click on that submit
 * button, which bubbles to the host exactly like the visible button's click and
 * carries the same `event.target.value` and UI integrity. A scripted
 * `button.click()` would be `isTrusted: false` and carry no integrity, so the
 * keyboard path relies on the browser's own gesture rather than synthesizing
 * one. The form's native submission is cancelled so the page does not navigate.
 * Both the visible button click and the Enter-driven submit click pass through a
 * single click handler on the form, where the in-flight guard lives, so Enter
 * and a click cannot fire two creates.
 *
 * Unlike cf-message-input (which emits a `cf-send` CustomEvent — isTrusted is
 * false for those, so they cannot carry UI integrity to a worker handler), the
 * create here flows from the raw, trusted button click.
 *
 * @element cf-submit-input
 *
 * @attr {string} placeholder - Placeholder text for the field
 * @attr {string} button-text - Text for the submit button (default: "Submit")
 * @attr {string} input-id - id forwarded to the inner <input> so callers/tests
 *   can target the field directly
 * @attr {boolean} disabled - Whether the field and button are disabled
 * @attr {string} initial-value - Optional one-time seed copied into `value` on
 *   first render; the field is uncontrolled after that
 * @attr {string} value - Live field text; read on the host as
 *   event.target.value when the submit button is clicked
