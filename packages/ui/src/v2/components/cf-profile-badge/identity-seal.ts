/**
 * identity-seal — a deterministic, generative identity treatment derived purely
 * from a principal DID.
 *
 * The point: the same identity yields the *same* aura everywhere it appears, so
 * the treatment reads as a recognizable fingerprint of that person — you learn
 * your friend's colors. Combined with `cf-profile-badge` only drawing it when
 * the profile cell carries a runtime-attested `represents-principal` CFC label
 * (read over trusted IPC on the main thread), the aura becomes hard to forge:
 * a user-space pattern can mimic the CSS, but not the attestation that unlocks
 * it, and the colors it would have to reproduce are pinned to a DID it does not
 * control.
 *
 * Pure + framework-free so it is trivially unit-testable and identical wherever
 * it runs.
