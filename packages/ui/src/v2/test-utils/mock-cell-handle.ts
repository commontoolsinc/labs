/**
 * Test utility: creates real CellHandle instances backed by a mock cell
 * network. The returned handles pass `isCellHandle()` (which uses
 * `instanceof CellHandle`) and support get/set/subscribe/key without
 * needing a live RuntimeClient or worker.
 *
 * ## Features
 *
 * - `createMockCellHandle(value)` — basic mock, same as before
 * - Parent-child propagation: when a child from `cell.key("foo")` calls
 *   `.set(v)`, the parent's value is updated and its subscribers fire
 * - `pushUpdate(cell, value)` — simulate a backend push via `$onCellUpdate`,
 *   letting tests distinguish local writes from runtime-originated updates
