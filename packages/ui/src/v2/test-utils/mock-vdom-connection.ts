/**
 * Test utility: a `CellHandle` whose connection speaks the VDOM session
 * protocol, so code that calls `render()` can be exercised without a worker.
 *
 * `createMockCellHandle` covers cell reads and writes; a renderer needs more
 * than that. It attaches a VDOM session to the connection, mounts a cell
 * reference over it, and unmounts on teardown. The session here records those
 * calls instead of talking to a worker, which is what lets a test assert
 * *which* cell a render mounted and that cancelling unmounted it.
