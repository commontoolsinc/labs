/**
 * Retired elements: inert passthrough stubs for components we have removed.
 *
 * Why this exists: a pattern's source is DURABLE. Pieces keep running the
 * source they were stored with, for as long as that piece lives — so the set
 * of element names patterns may emit is not "whatever the current palette
 * defines", it is the union of every palette that has ever shipped. Deleting a
 * component therefore does not retire it; it only removes the definition out
 * from under source that still names it.
 *
 * Removing `cf-cell-context` (#5132) demonstrated the cost. Stored home
 * sections still emitted it, and with both the component and its `jsx.d.ts`
 * declaration gone, rows that mapped over durable data stopped instantiating —
 * silently, because the failure surfaced as cell requests that never settled
 * rather than as an error. Blank Favorites and Profile tabs, nothing in the
 * console, for weeks.
 *
 * So a retired element keeps a definition that renders its children and does
 * nothing else. It stays a known element, its props keep their declared
 * meaning, and the subtree underneath it goes on working. It is loud rather
 * than fatal: one console warning per element per session at runtime, and an
 * `@deprecated` JSX declaration so authoring flags it at edit time. Patterns
 * get rewritten off it at their own pace; the stub leaves only when nothing
 * durable names it any more.

 *
 * They must also KEEP THAT COMPONENT'S HOST LAYOUT. This class deliberately
 * imposes none: an inert element is not a layout-neutral one. Stored source
 * was authored against the retired component's box — `display: block` with
 * `flex: 1`, an inline variant, whatever it had — and collapsing every stub to
 * `display: contents` would silently reflow the pages this exists to keep
 * working. Copy the retired component's `:host` rules into the stub; the point
 * is that nothing changes for source that still names it.
