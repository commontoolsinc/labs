// barrier posted after an error arrives after it, and a test that has seen the
// barrier has seen any error that fired.
//
// The load event is the point the cases below share. It fires once the document
// has parsed and its subresources have settled, and it lands after the
// violation for the two kinds of subresource those cases load: an `<img>`
// element and a `<link rel=stylesheet>`.
//
// It is not a general barrier for CSP violations, and the cases below stay
// inside what it covers. A blocked `<script src>`, a request a stylesheet
// starts such as a `background-image`, and a `fetch()` each report their
// violation only after the load event has already fired. A negative case of one
// of those shapes belongs in `unbarrierable` below rather than here.

// /!\ This test cannot assert what its name says, so it does not run.

// It is here rather than in `cases` because its guard is unsound.
// `window.open(url, "_self")` targets the current browsing context, so it hands
// that window back whether or not the navigation is allowed, and the fixture's
// `if (win) throw` therefore always throws. The host does dispatch the
// resulting "Uncaught Error: Window Opened": a listener installed before the
// load sees it every time. The case only ever passed because it began listening
// after `render` had resolved, by which point the error had already been
// dispatched, and reading the resulting silence as "no window was opened".
//
// What it set out to check is not observable from the host. The `_self`
// navigation tears the guest down before any guest code could report on it, and
// whether the navigation is ultimately blocked cannot be seen from out here.
// That is the same wall "disallows navigation" in `falseNegatives` below runs
// into — it drives the same self-navigation through `location.href`, is blocked
// in practice, and reports nothing — which is why it does not run either.

// an error, and requires the error to be in hand by barrier time. The third
// element is the description it must carry, so a control cannot pass on an
// unrelated error.
//
// The controls are not all doing the same job, and the difference decides what

//
// Ordering only needs proving for a case whose error can arrive after the

//
// The other six raise their error from a synchronous throw while the document
// parses, before the barrier script has been reached at all. No barrier the

// nothing about it. Their converted cases do not need them to: the error those
// cases rule out is raised the same way, during parse, so any barrier is
// already after it. What these six check instead is that the error channel is
// live for their shape — that `CSP_REPORTER` is installed, and that the guest
