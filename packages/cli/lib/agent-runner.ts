/**
 * The agent runner's queue mechanics: what `cf agent runner` does between
 * reading a user's agent queue and handing one claimed run to an executor.
 *
 * A runner holds one user's identity. It registers itself in the queue's
 * `agentRunner` entry, subscribes to the queue's `entries`, and follows each
 * entry to its `AgentRun` record on whichever host serves the record's space.
 * Everything it does is a reaction to a change in the queue or in a record it
 * follows; nothing here runs on a timer. A scan ends cancelled runs, recovers
 * records whose lease has passed, and claims the oldest queued records under
 * the concurrency cap. The run itself is the executor's, which
 * `agent-run-harness.ts` backs with `cf-harness`.
