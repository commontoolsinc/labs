/**
 * The value view: one cell rendered as structured JSON, scrollable, searchable,
 * and live for as long as it is open.
 *
 * It answers to the key table `views.md` gives a view, less the two that drill:
 * the motions and the two ways out, `/` with `n`/`N` to find text in the
 * rendering, `:` to run a shuttle line without leaving the frame, and `e` to
 * open the watched cell in an editor. `enter` and `backspace` need a cursor —
 * the row a view stands on — and this one has a scroll position instead, so
 * they arrive with the view that carries one
 * (`docs/plans/shuttle/build-sequence.md`). What the frame
 * offers along its bottom edge is what it answers to, so the two cannot part —
 * and the edge therefore says something different in each state this is in.
 *
 * It is a lens rather than a move (`docs/plans/shuttle/views.md`): opening one
 * changes no place, and `q` returns to the prompt exactly where it stood. What
 * it is a lens *onto* is a watch, and the two have different lifetimes — this
 * subscription is cancelled when the lens closes, and the watch's own goes on
 * firing (`watch.ts`).
 *
 * Everything here is a value and a decision about a value. The frame comes
 * back as lines and the keys arrive decoded, so a case drives the whole of it —
 * the scrolling, the rendering, the searching, and what each key does — with no
 * terminal. Where the lines land is the prompt's decision (`prompt.ts`), which
 * is what owns the keyboard while a lens is open.
 *
 * A line is the one thing this cannot carry out for itself. Running one is
 * asynchronous and is the prompt loop's work, so `:` and `e` leave the line
 * where the loop collects it ({@link ValueLens.asked}) and the loop hands back
 * what it produced ({@link ValueLens.answered}). That keeps the whole of this
 * module synchronous, and keeps one line at a time running under one cancel —
 * the loop's own, which is the cancel the prompt already offers.
