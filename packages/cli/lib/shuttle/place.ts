/**
 * A place is where shuttle stands: the position it reads from and the scope it
 * reads through. Both halves stick across navigation and both render, so they
 * travel as one pair and `cd` is the single door to either.
 *
 * Everything here is a value and a decision about a value — no connection, and
 * nothing read. The address grammar belongs to the fabric and this module
 * consumes it: a rooted or complete reference is read by
 * `normalizeLLMFriendlyRef` over the runner's `parseCellReference`, a relative
 * one by `parseRelativeReference`, a piece segment by `parsePieceSegment`, and
 * a piece position is written by `renderCellReference`. What this module adds
 * is what that grammar has no room for, which is everything above a piece: the
 * route a head's climbs walk back through, `-` and `/`, the `%n` a listing's
 * numbered row is named back by, the facets a space root lists and a rooted
 * operand reserves, the refusals a place is subject to, the operand that
 * reaches a child, which is those same readings asked in the other direction,
 * and the one reading that differs between moving somewhere and reading it: a
 * place cannot stand in an arguments cell, and an operand may still name one.
 *
 * Where a value stops is the moves that reach a piece, and the spellings that
 * name something no value here holds. Whether the fabric holds a piece, and
 * what a slug names, are reads, so those come back pending and `verbs.ts`
 * settles them: `cd` is the one verb whose success is a promise that the place
 * is there, so the read happens before the place is adopted. A `%n` is the
 * other: what a listing numbered is the session's to say, so it comes back for
 * `verbs.ts` to look up and hand back with the place and the operand the row
 * carries.
