/**
 * What `ls` finds where shuttle stands, what each row turns out to be, and how
 * each is written back.
 *
 * A listing prints names a person then types, so a row carries the operand
 * `cd` takes to reach it and not only the name it goes by. The two are the
 * same string for nearly every row and differ wherever a name's own characters
 * are readings — a key called `..`, one holding the separator — which is a
 * question about the place rather than about the listing, so
 * `operandForChild` answers it and this module asks.
 *
 * A row also carries what it is. The kind is recorded as the row is made
 * rather than worked out again by whoever reads it, which is what lets a
 * handle minted off a listing say what it stands for without a second read
 * (decision 27, `docs/plans/shuttle/README.md`) and what lets a callable be
 * annotated where it is listed rather than found by asking a piece for its
 * verbs.
 *
 * The reads are `packages/cli`'s, over the connection this process holds: a
 * space root has nothing to read, the two facets are `listSpaceSlugs` and
 * `listPieces`, and the cell inside a piece is `getCellValue`. Each takes the
 * connection through `deps.loadPieces`, which is the seam a held connection
 * fills.
 *
 * The cell is read for its value where a listing of keys alone would do, and
 * that costs nothing: `listCellKeys` (`lib/cell-listing.ts`) is `keysOf` over
 * exactly this read, so what a kind costs is the classification and not a
 * round trip. `keysOf` is still what names the rows, so a listing lists what
 * that seam lists.

 * what each line says, and which of them are rows.
 *
 * A row opens with the handle a person types to reach it again, in a column
 * the widest of them sets, and its name comes next in a column of its own. The
 * name is written as a token, so what a reader copies out of the name column
 * is what `cd` takes; a name a row has none for stands as a marker in that
 * column instead — and `quoteToken` is what keeps the two apart, not anything
 * here: `<` is one of the characters the grammar reserves, so a name holding
 * one is printed quoted and a name never opens with it. The name column
 * therefore opens with `<` exactly where the row has no name.
 *
 * Everything else on a line — the row with no operand, a callable's
 * annotation, a row's error, and the bound — is written as a marker. Those
 * brackets delimit for a reader and not for a parser: a payload may hold an
 * angle bracket of its own and nothing escapes it. Nothing parses a listed
 * line, and a form that could be parsed is a second output form rather than a
 * rule for this one (`docs/plans/shuttle/futures.md`).
 *
 * The bound comes back beside the rows rather than among them, because it is
 * not one of them: a page cuts rows and always shows the bound, and `--limit`
 * counts rows and never counts the bound. What it says — that these rows are
 * not everything standing here — is what a reader of a partial listing most
 * needs, so it is the one line a page may not drop.
 *
 * A row is one line, and lines are separated by a newline, so nothing written
 * on a line may put one inside it: a message and a bound each have their
 * newlines written as spaces, and a name carrying one is described rather than
 * written. What a message does with the rest of the class a terminal acts on,
 * and why a name cannot do the same, is with {@link oneLine}. Rewriting one
 * inside a name would leave a token `cd` no longer takes back to the row,
 * which is the guarantee the name is printed for, so what a terminal makes of
