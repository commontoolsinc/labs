/**
 * The verbs a line names, and the dispatch that picks one. The vocabulary they
 * are written in — the shuttle a verb acts on, the deps it reads through, and
 * the acts every verb shares — is `vocabulary.ts`.
 *
 * A verb returns what it did rather than writing it: a place that moved, a
 * rendering shuttle composed, a value the fabric holds, or a refusal carrying
 * its reason.
 * Nothing here touches a terminal, so where any of it lands is the prompt's
 * decision and a test drives the whole surface with none.
 *
 * The reads are `packages/cli`'s, over the connection this process holds:
 * `getCellValue` for `get`, `readWish` for `wish` and for the `#name` targets
 * `cd` navigates, and `listing.ts`'s composition for `ls`. Each takes that
 * connection through `deps.loadPieces`, which is the seam a held connection
 * fills.
 *
 * What a verb writes is bounded to one page (`page.ts`), and what did not fit
 * waits on the session beside the place for `more` (`session.ts`). Two verbs
 * write enough to need it — a listing of a populated space and the result of
 * a piece are each larger than a screen — and they take the same bound, so
 * `more` continues either without knowing which it is continuing.
 *
 * Three spellings come back off a `cd` unsettled, because settling each is a
 * read: a `#name` target, which the fabric resolves to an address; a space
 * written as a name, which the connection is asked about; and a place standing
 * on a piece, which the fabric is asked to resolve and to find. Settling each
 * and asking the place again is what this module adds to `place.ts`, which
 * decides everything about a place that a value can decide and stops exactly
 * there.
 *
 * The last of those is what makes `cd` worth its name. A shell's `cd` is the
 * one verb whose success says something, so the slug, the handle and the path
 * are each asked about before the place moves, and each refused in shuttle's
 * own words rather than left for the next verb to report in the runtime's.
 * What the prompt promises after it is exactly those three answers; the one
 * that can come back unanswered is the handle lookup, against a server that
 * does not advertise it. `get` waits on nothing: where an operand points is the
 * operand's own fact, and a read of a cell that is not there says so.

/**
 * Opens the value at the cell the line's operand names — where shuttle stands
 * where it names none — in the person's editor, and writes back what they
 * saved.
 *
 * The value goes out as JSON and comes back as JSON, so what is edited is what
 * a write takes. That is a different question from what `get` prints, and the
 * two have different answers on purpose: the prompt writes `undefined` as a
 * word and a `bigint` as a marked object, neither of which parses back as the
 * value it names.
 *
 * A value JSON cannot carry is refused before the editor opens, and that is
 * the whole of what stands between this and a destructive write. A cell holds
 * things JSON does not: an explicit `undefined` under a key, which the runtime
 * keeps and holds distinct from a removed key
 * (`packages/runner/test/undefined-values.test.ts`), an array hole, a
 * registry-interned symbol and a `bigint`, both of which survive a commit and
 * a cold replica
 * (`packages/runner/test/action-result-fabric-values.test.ts`). Serializing
 * and parsing back drops the first and the fourth, turns the second and the
 * third into `null`, and throws on the fifth — so a round trip through JSON
 * would write a value the person never typed and report it as a success.
 * {@link unwritableInJson} finds all of them first.
 *
 * What it does not do is invent a lossless spelling. Tagging those values so
 * they survive would change what `edit` writes for a value that legitimately
 * holds the tag, which is the question issue #6944 carries for `get` and is
 * not this verb's to settle.
 *
 * Five things stop the write, and each leaves the cell as it was. A whole
 * piece is refused in {@link WHOLE_PIECE_REFUSAL}, which is the sentence
 * {@link set} gives that write, and the refusal comes before the editor opens
 * rather than after a save: what a person typed into an editor is work, and a
 * line that could never have written it should say so while there is nothing
 * to lose. A value JSON cannot carry is refused above, before the editor opens
 * too. An editor that did not finish is the editor's own refusal, carried
 * through. Text that came back unchanged is nothing to write, and says so.
 * Text that will not parse is refused with the parse error and the file it is
 * still in.
 *
 * What decides the file's fate is not which of those happened but whether the
 * cell took the text: the file is removed exactly where it holds nothing the
 * cell does not. So a write that landed removes it, and so does a cancel the
 * write outran, the cell holding the text either way; a parse that failed, a
 * write the seam turned down, and a cancel that arrived before the write all
 * keep it, being the arms where the only copy of the work is the file. Text
 * that came back unchanged removes it too, there being no work in it.

 * level already stood at, walked segment by segment through the value it
 * returned, which names the first segment that is not there and the keys that
 * are — and no read at all where the move added no segment to a level already
 * confirmed, there being nothing left to look for.
 *
 * The read is the level above, never the destination, and that is what makes
 * every miss a refusal rather than a throw. A read aimed at a path the fabric
 * does not hold raises — that is what `get` reports and what tells a server
 * that went away from a line that was wrong — so a check aimed there would
 * report a wrong operand as a failed read. Aimed one level up it reads a cell
 * that is there, and what it finds is data rather than an error.
 *
 * A piece the resolution reached without proving — a handle, which is a
 * spelling and not a lookup — is looked up. `entityIdExists`
 * (`PiecesController`) tests one identifier against the space's own index
 * without selecting a stored value, which is what makes it affordable here,
 * and it is the same call `packages/fuse` asks before it projects an entity a
 * path named. A value read cannot stand in for it: a piece the space does not
 * hold reads as `undefined`, which is what an empty one reads as too.
 *
 * The lookup is a server capability and answers `undefined` where the server
 * does not advertise it (`entityIdLookup`, `packages/memory/v2.ts`). Then
 * nothing was learned and the move goes on, which is the one case left where
 * a handle the space does not hold is adopted — the bound `grammar.md`
 * records.
 *
 * Three reads means two boundaries between them, and a cancelled line is
 * checked at both: after the resolution, and after the lookup that only a
 * piece the resolution did not prove goes through. What each check promises
 * is what a check can — the read after it was never sent — and the walk, being
 * last, is followed by {@link landing}'s check instead, so a cancel arriving
 * during it stops the move rather than a read.
 *
 * @throws Whatever the read throws — an unreachable server, an identity that
 * will not load. A slug that names nothing is not one of those: it is a fact
 * about the line, so it comes back as a refusal.

 * on it as much as the id — a move to the same id under another scope is a

 * What the skip saves is a question rather than a round trip, and the

 * was a read per `cd`. `resolvePieceReference` reads nothing for a handle: a
 * slug is a token with no colon in it, so the resolution hands a handle
 * straight back without reaching the runtime (`packages/piece/src/slugs.ts`).
 * The saving is that the seam is not reached where it has nothing to do —
 * which is a fact a caller standing its own resolution in can see, and one
 * this module should not make such a caller work around.

 * `bigint`, a function, an array hole, or a cycle. Each of the first four is
 * dropped or throws; a hole and a missing property come back as `null` and as
 * a removed key, which the runtime holds distinct from what was there.
 *
 * The walk is its own rather than a comparison against

 * to a comparison of what comes back: a dropped key and a key that was never
 * there are the same object afterwards, and a structural comparison of a hole
 * against a `null` has to be told they differ. Walking finds each of them
 * where it is, which is also what lets the refusal say where.
 *
 * What makes the list closed is that it is read off the admission test rather
 * than composed beside it. `isValidFabricValueLayer`
 * (`packages/data-model/src/validity-check.ts`) switches on `typeof` and, for an
 * `object`, branches four ways; this walk answers the same arms:
 *
 * - `undefined`, `bigint` and a registry-interned `symbol` are admitted and
 *   have no JSON spelling at all.
 * - `number` is admitted unconditionally, and four of them do not survive
 *   ({@link unwritableNumber}). This is the arm a walk over types alone
 *   misses, every number looking alike to `typeof`.
 * - `boolean`, `string` and `null` survive whole.
 * - Among objects: a `FabricSpecialObject` — every `FabricBytes`,
 *   `FabricLink`, `FabricRegExp` and the rest — keeps its state where a
 *   serializer cannot see it and writes as `{}`, so its content is gone and
 *   the check is on the base class the admission test itself branches on,
 *   which is what covers a subclass added later. An array is walked for holes
 *   and a plain object for its keys. Everything else — a `Date`, a `Map`, an
 *   `Array` subclass, a null-prototype object — the admission test refuses
 *   outright, so no cell holds one.
 *
 * That leaves nothing for a `toJSON()` method to do here. It arrives on a
 * prototype, and a value carrying one is a class instance the admission test
 * has already refused unless it is a `FabricSpecialObject`, which this refuses
 * above.
 *
 * The bound on it is the object: what it finds is what the walk reaches, and
 * the walk reaches what a serializer reaches. It says nothing about a value
 * whose losses are outside the walk — a getter that answers differently the
 * second time is the shape to keep in mind.
