/**
 * Returns `value` as the reader sees it: indented JSON, with what cannot be
 * written that way said instead.
 *
 * `JSON.stringify` returns no string for several different reasons and says
 * which for none of them, so this tells them apart before it is asked. A
 * value that is `undefined` is what the fabric holds nothing at, and the word
 * says so. A registry-interned symbol is a value a cell does hold and JSON
 * has no form for, and the word there would say the cell was empty when it is
 * not, so what comes back names the kind instead.
 *
 * A `bigint` is a value a cell holds too, and the writer throws on one rather
 * than declining it, so it is given a form on the way past: `{ $bigint: "…" }`
 * with the number as its decimal string, which is what `cf cell get` writes
 * for the same value (`safeStringify`, `render.ts`). One question answered
 * twice ought to be answered the same way, and a test compares the two rather
 * than restating the spelling.
 *
 * Where the two surfaces still differ they differ on purpose, and this is the
 * one that is right: `cf cell get` writes `null` both for a value that is
 * `undefined` and for a symbol, and `null` is a value a cell can hold. What
 * a cell holds nothing at is nothing, and the word above says that instead.
 *
 * The bound is on nesting rather than on a kind, and it is what a caller
 * cannot see. An `undefined` or an interned symbol under a key loses the key,
 * which reads as a key the fabric does not hold; either of them at an array
 * index, and an array's hole, is written `null`, which reads as a value the
 * fabric holds. Every one of those is a value a cell takes and hands back,
 * and a read produces them without being asked: a property a schema does not
 * require reads as `undefined` where the data underneath does not match it
 * (`schema-view.ts`). A function and a unique symbol are not bounds here,
 * because neither survives to be read out of a cell. The fabric's
 * value-admission test refuses both on the way in
 * (`assertValidFabricValueLayer`, `packages/data-model/src/validity-check.ts`),
 * and its codec has no form for either at the commit that would store one
 * (`BaseEncodeAct`), so the raw write that skips the first still meets the
 * second.
 *
 * What the writer leaves for this one to do is the class a terminal acts on.
 * It escapes every C0 character a value held and passes `DEL` and C1 through,
 * so those are finished here, in JSON's own spelling rather than the glyphs a
 * message gets — the two conventions and the reason they differ are with
 * `escapeControlCharactersInJson` (`place.ts`).
