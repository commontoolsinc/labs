/**
 * How a shuttle line splits into tokens, how a value prints as one of them,
 * and where the token a half-typed line ends in begins.
 *
 * `cf` never does either: it is handed `Deno.args`, split for it already by
 * the operating system's shell. Shuttle reads its own line, so the split is
 * shuttle's, and so is the printing that inverts it.
 *
 * The two halves live in one module because they are one decision: what
 * {@link quoteToken} writes, {@link splitLine} reads back as the one value it
 * was given. That is what lets a value print bare where nothing in it needs
 * more, which is the common case and the point.
 *
 * {@link tailOfLine} is the third, and it is here for the same reason: where
 * a token ends is this module's question whether the line is whole or still
 * being typed, and a completion that answered it for itself would be a
 * second grammar to keep in step with this one.
 *
 * What a token then means is decided elsewhere — `place.ts` reads an operand
 * as a reference or as one of the navigation spellings, and a verb reads its
 * own. This module bounds where a token ends and says nothing past that.
 *
 * `packages/cli` splits a line too, in `tokenizeLine` under `lib/completion/`,
 * and this is not a second copy of it. That one reconstructs what bash would
 * have done to a *partial* line: it reads up to a cursor offset and always
 * pushes a last word for the cursor to sit in, so its list is never empty
 * where this one's is; it separates on the space and the tab alone; and it
 * refuses nothing, a half-typed line being its normal input. It is also not an
 * export entry of that package, so nothing here could call it.
 */

/**
 * The characters shuttle's line grammar spends on structure rather than on
 * data: the pipe, the local-program escape, the two redirection operators,
 * the `#` a wish target and an argument suffix are written with, and the `%`
 * a numbered handle is (`docs/plans/shuttle/grammar.md`).
 *
 * A value holding one of these is printed quoted wherever in the value it
 * sits. {@link quoteToken} is handed a value and no position, so it quotes on
 * the character rather than on the reading — which quotes values whose
 * position would have left the character ordinary, and is the price of a
 * printer that needs to know nothing about where its output lands.
 *
 * The characters an operand writes an address with are not here, the `:` of a
 * scheme and of a handle among them. Those are read inside a token by the
 * reference grammar rather than by the split, and a quote reaches no reading
 * (`docs/plans/shuttle/grammar.md`), so quoting them would change nothing a
 * reading does and would cost the bare printing of every address. A value
 * whose own characters a reading would take is named by a reference instead,
 * which reads none of them.

 * whatever it is. Double quotes group, and between them a backslash escapes
 * one of {@link DOUBLE_QUOTE_ESCAPES} and is otherwise a character of the
 * token; outside quotes it escapes whatever follows it. Runs that touch are
 * one token, so `a"b c"d` is the single token `ab cd`, and an empty pair of

 *
 * A line is refused for one of two reasons, both of them a token with no end:
 * a quote that never closes, and a trailing backslash with nothing to escape.

 * says nothing about whether its tokens name anything.
 *
 * `line` is one line, and a terminator on it is whoever read it to strip. The

 * across the break into a single run of tokens rather than into two commands.
