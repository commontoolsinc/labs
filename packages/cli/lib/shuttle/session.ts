/**
 * The session objects that stand beside the place: what the last listing
 * numbered, what a rendering had left over for `more`, which pieces this run
 * has started, and what it is watching.
 *
 * All four are things a run accumulates rather than things a place holds. A
 * place is where shuttle stands and moves under `cd`; these are what the lines
 * before this one left behind, and a `cd` neither resets nor carries any of
 * them. Keeping them beside the place rather than inside it is what decision
 * 17 means by a handle table as a session object, what decision 28 means by
 * watches as session objects, and what keeps `%3` naming the row it was minted
 * for after the place has moved on.
 *
 * They are four fields and not one, because they are reset by different
 * lines. A listing resets the numbering — `%1` is the first row of the newest
 * listing, and a run's handles stay valid until one arrives — while every
 * rendering that did not fit replaces what `more` continues. So a `get` past
 * an `ls` leaves the handles alone and takes over the continuation, which is
 * exactly what decision 24 says: `more` continues the listing, and a new
 * listing is what resets the numbering. The warm set is reset by nothing: a
 * piece started stays started for the life of the process. The watches are
 * reset by `unwatch` alone, which is what makes a watch outlive the view that
 * armed it.
 *
 * Nothing here reads the fabric, moves a place or draws anything. The one
 * thing it reaches outside itself is a watch's own cancel, which is what
 * disarming one is, and a watch holding none is inert — so a case still drives
 * the whole of this with no connection, no place and no terminal.
