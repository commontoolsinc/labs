 *
 * Every read a line sends and every move it adopts goes through here — this
 * module's, and the completion's beside it (`completion.ts`) — and the reason
 * is that the rule they are held to is not one discipline can keep. The rule is that **nothing is awaited between the check and the act
 * it guards** — an await there is a window the cancel lands in and the act
 * happens anyway — and a rule of that shape is invisible: the code reads
 * correctly whether or not the window is there, no case can see it, and the
 * next author to insert a line between two statements has no way to know
 * which two they are.
 *
 * So the two are one expression here instead. The arguments are evaluated
 * before this is entered, so a caller that awaits while composing them still
 * has the check on the far side of its own await; and there is no statement
 * position between the check and the call for an await to occupy, because
 * there are no statements between them. Passing `act` and its arguments
 * separately rather than as a closure is what leaves nowhere to hide one: a
 * closure has a body, and a body can await.
 *
 * What that is worth, stated at its actual size: it stops an await written as
 * a *statement*, which is how one gets written. It does not stop every
 * insertion an expression admits — `await (await something(), act(...args))`
 * reopens the window inside this very line, and nothing here would notice.
 * So this is a guarantee against the edit somebody makes, not against the
 * edit somebody constructs, and the cases are what cover the second: a line
 * cancelled at its first suspension reaches this function before its read,
 * and every verb that reads has such a case (`shuttle-verbs.test.ts`).
 *
 * There are two checks and not one, and the second is what a caller relies on
 * without knowing it. The first stops the act; the second stops its *answer*,
 * because an act that was already in flight when the cancel arrived finishes
 * anyway — the runtime's reads take no signal — and everything a caller then
 * does with what it returned is an adoption. A `ran` therefore means the line
 * was live when the answer arrived, which is the reading the next author will
 * take from the name whether or not it were true; where it is false the
 * interruption comes back and the answer is dropped.
 *
 * What is left to the caller is which arm it returns, and the arms are the
 * outcome's own, so a cancelled act is handed back rather than tested for.
 * What it does *not* say is which of the two checks stopped an act — a caller
 * that has something to undo where the act ran needs that, and the one there
 * is spells the pair out itself ({@link edit}).

/**
 * Helper for the verbs that write a rendering, which is one page of `lines`
 * within `bound`, with the rest left on the session for `more`.
 *
 * `hint` is what the status line offers beside `more`, and it rides the
 * continuation so that every page of one rendering makes the same offer: a
 * `get` whose value ran to four pages says `--select` on all four, because it
 * is as true on the fourth as on the first.
 *
 * Every rendering passes through here, including one that fit whole, which is
 * what clears a continuation the line before it left: `more` after a listing
 * that fit is `more` with nothing waiting, not `more` writing the tail of the
 * listing before it.
 *
 * It comes back as the one arm of {@link Outcome} a rendering can be rather
 * than as the union, so a caller that wants the lines rather than the outcome
 * — one composing a page into a line of its own — reads them without a test
 * that could not fail.
