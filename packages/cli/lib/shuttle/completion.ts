/**
 * What `tab` finishes: the token a line ends in, completed against the verbs
 * and against what stands where shuttle stands.
 *
 * Decision 3 (`docs/plans/shuttle/README.md`) names completion as part of what
 * serves the audience it puts second, and this is that: a person who knows
 * the fabric and not this shell's vocabulary finds both by pressing one key.
 *
 * `packages/cli` has a completion of its own under `lib/completion/`, and this
 * is not a second copy of it. That one answers a shell asking what a
 * half-typed `cf` line could become, so each provider resolves its own
 * connection from the words on that line and fails silently and empty; this
 * one runs inside a process that already holds a connection and already
 * stands somewhere, so what it reads is the listing (`listing.ts`) rather
 * than a resolution. The one thing it takes from the other is that posture
 * toward failure: a read that failed offers nothing, where `ls` raises,
 * because a tab is not a request for an answer about the fabric and a person
 * pressing one has not asked to be told anything.
 *
 * Two properties bound what may be offered, and both are borrowed rather than
 * restated.
 *
 * **A completion offers a token the line takes.** The candidates under a
 * place are `operandForChild`'s answers (`place.ts`), which is what a listing
 * prints for the same rows, so a name a completion writes is one `cd` takes
 * back to the row — including a name whose own characters are readings, which
 * comes back as the reference that names it. Where on the line the token may
 * stand is `candidatesAfter`'s answer (`verbs.ts`), which reads the tokens
 * before it through the dispatch's own option reading, so a completion never
 * offers an operand the verb would refuse.
 *
 * Nothing else turns a candidate down, and in particular nothing reads its
 * shape. An operand carrying the separator is offered like any other, which
 * is how a row whose own operand is a reference is reached at all. So what
 * bounds a completion is which candidates there are rather than which are
 * allowed: `cd slugs/bo` at a space root writes nothing because no row
 * standing at the root is called that, the row it names standing inside
 * `slugs/` — and reaching a row there is a read of a place the line has not
 * moved to, which is a completion of its own rather than a rule against this
 * one.
 *
 * **A completion reads, so it cancels.** The read and the answer each go
 * through `guarded`, so a `ctrl-c` stops the read that has not gone out and
 * the answer that has not been given. What it cannot stop is a read already
 * sent, and what stops that taking effect is the prompt: a completion is
 * written onto the line it was computed for and onto no other, and a `ctrl-c`
 * has emptied that line.
