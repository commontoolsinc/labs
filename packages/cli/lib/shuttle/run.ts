/**
 * Running a shuttle: one connection, one place, and the prompt over both, for
 * as long as the person keeps typing.
 *
 * This is what `cf sh` calls. The terminal opens first and the connection
 * inside it, because the terminal is where the connection's own writing has to
 * land: a pattern's console output and the lines a connect writes for itself
 * would otherwise reach the process's streams, which is the middle of the
 * drawing once a prompt is painted (`announce.ts`). The connect then happens
 * before the first line rather than on it, because the place cannot be built
 * without it: a space written as a name is a DID only once a session has
 * resolved it, and a place stands in a space. That is the connect a shell pays
 * once where a one-shot command pays it per invocation.
 *
 * The invocation session is minted here for the same reason and on the same
 * terms: it is what makes an invocation id replayable, and one shuttle is one
 * run — exactly the span over which repeating an id should mean repeating a
 * call.
 *
 * The editor is wired here and nowhere under it, because an editor draws on
 * the screen the prompt is holding in raw mode: what runs one has to take that
 * mode off around it and put it back after, and only what opened the terminal
 * can.
 *
 * Nothing here reads the command line. What a person wrote is read by the
 * command, in the words every other command reads a space and an identity in,
 * and what arrives is the connection it settled on.
