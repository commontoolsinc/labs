 * long-lived process has to make, and this module is where they are made.
 *
 * The connect sequence belongs to `loadPieces` (`lib/piece.ts`),
 * which this module calls. What it adds is two memos, whose retry policies
 * are opposites. A construction is not held when it fails, so a later ask
 * opens again; that covers the connection that never opened, and a connection
 * that opens and then drops is outside it entirely, since nothing here
 * observes a drop, retries one, or reports one. A disposal is held whatever
 * it does, so a close that fails is terminal and the holder serves nothing
 * after it.
