/**
 * What a terminal has to be sent to show the line being typed, to end it, to
 * put a line above it, and to take the screen for a full-screen frame.
 *
 * A line being edited is redrawn where it stands, so a terminal is told where
 * the last drawing put the cursor as well as what to draw. That bookkeeping is
 * a line, a cursor and a width laid out into rows, and it is here rather than
 * beside the writing so that a case can read the escape sequences back without
 * a terminal to send them to.
 *
 * The cursor is put back with the terminal's own save and restore
 * (`ESC 7`/`ESC 8`) rather than by counting where the text left it, because
 * where a line exactly fills a row leaves the cursor is a thing terminals
 * disagree about. What the save costs is the case where drawing scrolls the
 * screen: the saved position is the line's first row, and a line taller than
 * the terminal scrolls that row away.
 *
 * A cursor arrives as a code-point index into the line, which is the unit the
 * buffer it comes from moves in, and where that lands on the screen is worked
 * out here at the columns a terminal gives each character. The two are not the
 * same count: a character drawn double-wide is one code point and two columns,
 * so a cursor moved by the index would sit left of where the typing appears,
 * and by one column more for every such character in front of it.
 *
 * A line carries the width it was drawn at rather than taking the current one,
 * because a window resized between two drawings leaves the old line occupying
 * the rows the old width gave it. What that does not survive is the terminal
 * reflowing what is already on screen, which a resize also does: after one,
 * neither width describes what is there, and the drawn width is merely the one
 * that put it there.

 * {@link escapeControlCharacters} shows every character a terminal acts on as
 * the glyph naming it, which is the treatment a message gets everywhere else
 * in the shell (`place.ts`).

 * The line feed is the one character of that class this lets through, and it
 * lets it through as a row rather than as content: what arrives here is
 * already laid out in lines by whoever composed it, and a terminal in raw mode
 * moves the cursor down on a break without returning it to the left, so every
 * break is sent with the return a terminal not in raw mode would have
 * supplied. Every other character of the class is a picture of itself, the
 * carriage return and the escape among them, so nothing that arrives here can
 * move the cursor off the row it was given or start a sequence.

 * blanking it and drawing again — which is what a reader sees as a flicker.
 *
 * Line wrapping is off for the drawing and back on after it. A row filling the
 * terminal's last column exactly would otherwise carry the cursor onto the

 * could move the cursor off the row it was given, clear the screen, or draw
 * over the frame around it. The holding is here, at the terminal itself, so
 * that no composer of a row can be the one that forgot; a glyph is not a
