/**
 * A watch: a subscription on one cell that outlives the view that opened it,
 * and the line each of its settled changes writes above the prompt.
 *
 * Two things live here and they are the same thing seen from either end. What
 * a watch *is* is a session object (decision 28,
 * `docs/plans/shuttle/README.md`) — armed by `watch`, listed by `watches`,
 * disarmed by `unwatch`, and unaffected by the lens that opened it closing.
 * What a watch *does* is turn each settled change into one line naming the
 * cell that changed. It says that the cell moved rather than what it moved
 * to: reading the value out is `get`'s, and watching it move is the lens's.
 *
 * Nothing here subscribes. The subscription is `sinkCellValue`
 * (`lib/piece.ts`), which is where the guard-plus-`idle()` settling lives, and
 * a watch is handed the cancel it hands back. So every case drives the whole
 * of this with no connection: a settle is a call, and what a change writes is
 * a value.
