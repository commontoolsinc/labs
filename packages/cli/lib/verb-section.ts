/**
 * The boundary between a callable's section and the read step's.
 *
 * A call is read by three parties in one order: `cf` resolves the target, the
 * callable consumes its input, and the read step shapes what came back. The
 * verb names the callable, so it also opens that callable's section — the same
 * boundary `docker run` draws at an image name and `ssh` at a host, where a
 * positional makes a marker unnecessary. What a marker IS needed for is the
 * boundary no positional draws: the one where the callable's section ends and
 * the read step's begins.
 *
 * ```text
 * cf piece call <target> <verb> <verb input> -- <read opts>
 * cf exec <mountedFile> <verb input>   -- <read opts>
 * ```
 *
 * So a projection has exactly one place to stand, and every other reading of
 * one is refused here rather than absorbed. Before the verb it names
 * positions in a result nothing has identified yet. Inside the callable's
 * section it is read where a verb's fields are read, and those two
 * vocabularies are independent — either may grow a name the other already
 * has, so a line that worked would reach a different reader with no edit and
 * no warning. Past the marker it is a projection, whatever the verb's own
 * fields are called.
 *
 * Every refusal prints the line that works, which is what `refuseSectionMarker`
 * in `section-marker.ts` does for the marker written where nothing closes, and
 * what carries a change that lands at once rather than through a warned
 * window: a caller meeting one of these wrote a spelling that used to work, so
 * a message saying only what is wrong asks them to rediscover the grammar
 * while one that prints the line asks them to retype it.
 *
 * The design, and the four shapes rejected in reaching it, are recorded under
 * "Naming the target" in
 * [CLI surface shape](../../../docs/plans/cli-surface-shape.md).
