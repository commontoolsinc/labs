/**
 * Creating a profile from the command line.
 *
 * A profile is appended to the home root's `profiles` list, which is
 * owner-protected behind the create surface's UI contract: the append must
 * ride an event that a trusted surface attests to. In the shell that surface
 * is the create form, and the html renderer marks its click. Here the CLI is
 * the surface. The person typing the command is the same actor the renderer
 * stands in for, acting under their own key on their own machine, so the CLI
 * builds the event the renderer would have built and marks it the same way
 * (`trusted-action-event.ts`). What the contract refuses is pattern code or
 * untrusted content forging the gesture, and neither can reach this path.
 *
 * The handler itself is the home pattern's `createProfile`, so the profile is
 * made exactly as the shell makes one: in its own space, its display name
 * carried on the event and never on a draft cell.
