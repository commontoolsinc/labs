/**
 * The derivation behind `cf piece describe`: a piece's documentation, built
 * from the two schemas its compiled pattern already carries.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. Loading the piece and its pattern is
 * `describePiece` (`piece.ts`), which shares one load with the verbs listing;
 * rendering is `pieceDescribeLines` / `pieceDescribeJson`
 * (`../commands/piece.ts`). This module only decides what the page SAYS.
 *
 * The sources, and why each line can exist at all:
 *
 * - The PURPOSE is the doc comment on the pattern's result (Output)
 *   interface, which the schema generator attaches to the result schema's
 *   root as its `description`. That is the one compiled home a pattern's own
 *   prose has — a module-level comment is stripped at emit and survives only
 *   in the stored source.
 * - A STATE field is a declared result property that is not callable: its
 *   prose is the field's own doc comment, compiled verbatim onto the
 *   property.
 * - An INPUT is an argument-schema property: what a caller supplies, where
 *   state is what only the pattern's verbs change. The page keeps the two
 *   apart because that split is the piece's usage model.
 * - A VERB row is the callable listing's row, unchanged — one classification
 *   for `describe`, `verbs`, and `call`, so the three can never disagree
 *   about what is callable.
