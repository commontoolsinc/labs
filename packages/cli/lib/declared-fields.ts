/**
 * What a schema position declares, read the way the runtime reads it.
 *
 * Two doors ask this question of two different schemas. The call door asks a
 * verb's event schema which fields a payload may carry; the read door asks a
 * source cell's schema which fields a `--select` path may name. A name neither
 * declares is the same mistake either way, so both are settled here rather
 * than twice — the vocabulary a refusal prints, and the rule deciding whether
 * a position judges undeclared names at all, are one implementation.
 *
 * Every reading here fails open: where the schema stops proving what sits
 * under a position, the position declares nothing and judges nothing. A refusal
 * spends nothing and can be retried, while a wrongly refused call cannot be
 * made and a wrongly refused read cannot be taken.

 * the schema it resolved to — the same key `localRefTarget` cycles on, and the
 * only one that works here: resolution hands back a fresh view of a definition
 * each time, so a recursive `$ref` reaches an object this walk has never seen
 * and descends forever. A member is skipped once its reference has been
 * followed in the scope it was written in; a definition contributes its fields
 * once, and a schema naming itself terminates.
