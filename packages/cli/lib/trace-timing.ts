/**
 * Phase timing for the CLI's own code paths, written to stderr when
 * `CF_CLI_TRACE_TIMINGS=1` (docs/development/CONFIGURATION.md). Every phase
 * line has one shape, `[cf-phase] <ms>ms :: <label>`, so a trace from any
 * command greps the same way. Labels are `<operation>.<step>`, and phases
 * can nest: when an operation wraps a call to another traced operation, its
 * phase encloses theirs — on `cf cell get`, `getCellValue.selection` encloses
 * the `deriveSelectedValue.*` lines — so the lines of a trace do not sum;
 * total a run from its outermost phases. Only phases with a common parent are
 * siblings that add up, and an operation reached without a wrapper (a
 * selection on `cf piece call` or `cf wish`) reports its own phases with no
 * encloser at all.
 * The piece package keeps its own `[piece-phase]` lines behind the same
 * variable; together they attribute a command's latency across the
 * CLI/controller boundary.
