/**
 * Guard against the one way a correct completion script still does nothing.
 *
 * The emitted function calls `cf completion complete` *by name* on every Tab,
 * and discards that command's errors so a failing completion can never paste
 * text into the user's command line. Those two facts compose badly: with no
 * `cf` on PATH, every Tab silently yields zero candidates, and the script the
 * user just installed looks like it simply does not work. The `deno` binding
 * inherits the same fate, so `deno task cf <TAB>` — the invocation most people
 * actually type — is dead too.
 *
 * CI already resolves `cf` by name — `packages/cli/integration/integration.sh`
 * runs `command cf`, and the workflow puts the downloaded binary on
 * `$GITHUB_PATH` — but it constructs that PATH itself, and local runs of the
 * same scripts set `CF_CLI_INTEGRATION_USE_LOCAL` to force the source CLI
 * instead. Completion is therefore the first thing to require `cf` on PATH on
 * a *developer's own machine*, where nothing sets it up. This check makes that
 * requirement legible when the script is generated rather than at some later
 * Tab press.
