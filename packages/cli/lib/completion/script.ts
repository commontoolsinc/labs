 * matters because a sourced completion function lives in the user's shell
 * profile — it is the one piece of this feature that does not get updated when
 * the CLI is rebuilt, so it must not encode a command tree that can go stale.
 *
 * Each script binds two command words. `cf` is the compiled binary; `deno` is
 * bound because the CLI is most often run as `deno task cf …`. The `deno`
 * binding is cooperative: the CLI reports `:cf:notmine` for any `deno` line
 * that is not a CLI invocation, and the function hands back to whatever
 * completed `deno` beforehand, so `deno test`/`deno task build` keep their own
 * completions.

 * `http://host:8000` would arrive pre-shredded. The CLI tokenizes instead, and
 * the reply is re-trimmed to the fragment bash believes it is replacing.
 *
 * The trailing space is inverted rather than suppressed, because macOS ships
 * bash 3.2 and `compopt` is bash 4+. Registering `-o nospace` and letting a
 * candidate carry its own space is the one mechanism that works on both: the
 * held cursor a cell path needs then costs nothing on the shell this
