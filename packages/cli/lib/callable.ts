 * the verb's event schema names exactly the fields the verb declares. What it
 * adds is treating an undeclared one as a reason to refuse, which nothing else
 * on this path does — the runtime's own read drops the field and delivers the
 * rest, so the handler runs, the receipt is written, and the caller is told the
 * call settled with a field it wrote never having arrived. A TypeScript author
 * never meets that; a caller writing JSON by hand or by model meets it first.
 *
 * Which positions drop, measured against the read a handler's event goes
 * through (`SchemaObjectTraverser.#traverseObjectWithSchema`, runner
 * traverse.ts, whose `addOptionalProperty` is a no-op on the
 * `validateAndTransform` path), for an object holding one declared and one
 * undeclared field:

 * | --- | --- |

 * | `{anyOf: [...]}` | both fields |
 * | any of those plus `additionalProperties` | both fields |
 *
 * So a position with no property map is open by construction and refuses
 * nothing — a verb declaring no fields THAT way takes anything. Every position
 * that has one drops what none of its maps name, whether or not it also states
 * a type and whether it reaches the map directly or through a conjunction.
 *
 * The two rows delivering NOTHING are two readings of "declares no fields", and
 * both refuse every field written there. A bare `properties` map drops the
 * fields it declares as well, which is a defect of its own and not one a gate
 * over undeclared fields can speak to.

 * receipt and `"/"` IS the receipt address; when it resolves elsewhere, the
 * receipt address stays available under the reserved bare key `"receipt"` —
 * pointer keys always begin with `/`, so no result path can collide with
 * it.
 *
 * Below the root, every value path is resolved through the receipt cell
 * (`key()` steps plus `resolveAsCell`), and a path earns an entry exactly
 * when its backing document differs from its enclosing one — a path inside
 * the same plain JSON needs no link. Below an emitted entry the comparison
 * rebases onto that entry's document, so a chain of references annotates
 * each hop once. Recursion always continues from the RESOLVED cell, even
 * when no entry is emitted: a same-document link can still redirect to
 * another path, and descendants must be read from the redirect's target.
 * Keys are RFC 6901 JSON pointers (the runner's `encodeJsonPointer`, the
 * same encoding the llm-dialog link strings use), so a property name
 * containing `/` or `~` stays unambiguous.
 *
 * The walk covers the JSON of the value that was read back, and it ENFORCES
 * that rather than assuming it: descent stops at any non-plain object —
 * including a result that is itself one — so a live runtime object reached
 * through the result contributes its own link and nothing below it. That
 * bound is what makes the walk terminate. A result carrying a piece that
 * owns verbs is the case that proves the point — the stream on that piece is
 * a live object whose `runtime`/`scheduler` graph refers back to itself, and
 * walking into it exhausted the stack.

 * with the declaration's whole shape in its place. Where a caller's own shape
