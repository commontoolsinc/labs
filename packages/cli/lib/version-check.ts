// Detects a cf ↔ server version skew before it turns into confusing failures.
//
// The join key is the git commit SHA — the only version identity this repo
// deploys by. The server reports its commit on its `/_health` response (and
// `/api/meta`); the runtime captures it from that response's header during
// the health check it already performs, so learning the server side costs
// no request of its own and completes exactly when the health probe does —
// no body read that a stalled stream could hold open. This cf invocation
// resolves its own commit via `lib/build-info.ts` (baked metadata or local
// git — no network). Either side being unknown (old server, no git, no
// baked marker) skips silently — absence of metadata is not evidence of a
// mismatch.
//
// A mismatch is not one problem but two, with different severities. In local
// development it is completely normal for cf to be NEWER than the server it
// talks to (the checkout moved on; the server kept running, or the deploy
// trails main), and SHA distance is not interface distance — most commits
// touch nothing wire-visible, so on a success the mismatch was evidence of
// nothing. That direction therefore prints nothing at connection time: the
// note is held, and appears only when the process ends with a nonzero exit
// code, where it is diagnostic context for a failure that actually happened
// rather than a prophecy on every command. cf being OLDER than the server is
// the dangerous direction: the server speaks a protocol this cf predates,
// and commands will likely fail in confusing ways — that warns immediately
// and loudly. Diverged and unorderable pairs (including every compiled
// binary, which carries no history to order by) also warn immediately,
// because cf-behind cannot be ruled out. Direction is proven by git ancestry
// in the checkout's history, so it is only available to source runs whose
// history contains the server's commit.
//
// The failure-exit deferral can only annotate failures that SURFACE — a
// nonzero exit. If a protocol bump ever causes invisible errors (wrong
// results, silent misbehavior, a command that exits 0 having done the wrong
// thing), this heuristic cannot see them, and the migration is a negotiated
// compatibility key: the server advertises a protocol version bumped only on
// wire-visible change, and cf checks it as a range at session open, no git
// history involved. Witnessing such an invisible error is the trigger for
// that migration; do not build it speculatively.
