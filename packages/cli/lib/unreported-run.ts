/**
 * The exit discipline for a run that writes: a `cf` invocation that ENDS
 * while its run has not reported must not look like a success.
 *
 * A Deno process whose main promise is still pending, with no work left on
 * the event loop, does not hang — it drains and exits, silently, with code
 * 0. Every await in a bulk apply sits under that rule: the engine can stop
 * settling anywhere between opening a session and returning its report, and
 * the process then ends having written part of a migration, printed no
 * summary, and told its caller everything went well. A script cannot see the
 * difference, and neither can an operator reading a log whose last line is a
 * row that applied normally.
 *
 * So the report is not the only thing that decides how the process ends. A
 * run arms a guard for the whole of its life and stands it down the moment
 * it has reported; if the process ends first, the guard says so on stderr
 * and raises the exit code. It is armed on the real event — the process
 * ending — rather than on a clock, so it costs a run that finishes nothing
 * and cannot cut one short.
 *
 * Scoped to the runs that write. A command whose whole job is to stay up
 * until interrupted (`cf piece render --watch`) ends exactly this way on
 * purpose, so this is never installed process-wide.
