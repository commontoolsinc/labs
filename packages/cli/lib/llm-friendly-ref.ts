/**
 * The reference form — `//<space>/<piece>[#member][@qualifier…][/path]` or its
 * space-relative form `/<piece>[#member][@qualifier…][/path]`, the runner's
 * `parseCellReference` grammar — is the canonical way to name a cell: the
 * same structure names the same cell in patterns, in the shell, and at this
 * CLI's intake seams.
 *
 * What a reader may write in the space and piece segments is where the
 * readings differ, and the difference is what each of them can resolve. A
 * pattern resolves a link from the string alone, so it requires the
 * self-identifying spellings — a space DID and a piece handle. This CLI opens
 * a session before it reads anything, so it resolves a space by name and a
 * piece by slug as well, and accepts both here. `did:key:...` and `fid1:...`
 * say what they are, so neither can be mistaken for a name and the wider
 * vocabulary costs the narrower one nothing.
 *
 * On the piece segment, `#argument` selects a member,
 * the piece's arguments cell, the way `--input` does.
 *
 * The CLI's bare grammar (`pieceId[#argument][@scope]`,
 * `pieceId[@scope]/path` at link endpoints, and slugs) is a convenience alias
 * for interactive use. New reference-syntax capabilities land in the
 * canonical form first, and the alias must not grow a capability the
 * canonical form lacks. The member is one the canonical form has, and a bare
 * id designates the piece a reference designates, so it means the same on
 * both.
