/**
 * Fetch mocking for pattern-tests (CT-1768).
 *
 * A test opts in by exporting a module-scope `fetchMocks: FetchMockEntry[]`. The
 * runner reads it after compile and injects {@link makeMockFetch} as the
 * runtime's `fetch` (`RuntimeOptions.fetch`), so a `fetchData` resolves against
 * the mock instead of the network. Driving the in-flight request to completion
 * stays the harness's job via the `{ settle: true }` step (`runtime.settled()`).
 *
 * This is the generic-HTTP (`fetchData`) seam; LLM calls
 * (`generateText`/`generateObject`) mock separately at the `LLMClient` layer
 * (`@commonfabric/llm`).
 */

/**
 * One declarative fetch mock. The first entry whose `urlIncludes` is a substring
 * of a request URL wins; `base64Body` takes precedence over `body` (for binary
 * payloads like images).
 *
 * `delayMs` holds the response for a fixed real-time delay before returning, so a
 * `fetchData` isn't resolved instantly — useful for tests that depend on *when* a
 * fetch resolves. It stays deterministic: `runtime.settled()` awaits the actual
 * (delayed) fetch promise. (Precise, manually-released ordering — a "gate" — needs
 * a SES-clean harness mechanism; tracked as a follow-up, see CT-1768.)
