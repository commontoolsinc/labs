/**
 * The `--` marker, on a command that has no section for it to close.
 *
 * `--` closes a callable's section, so it is written on the commands that have
 * one — `call` and `exec` — and nowhere else. A command whose read options
 * follow the target directly has no such boundary, and Cliffy hands every word
 * after the marker to the literal arguments instead. An action that reads none
 * of them discards the words in silence: a projection written that way returns
 * an unprojected value and exits zero.
 *
 * That is the failure this refuses. It is the same shape as a field named for
 * a read option being read as one — a line that means something else, succeeds,
 * and says nothing — which is why the marker is refused rather than accepted as
 * a second spelling.
 *
 * The decision, and the alternative of accepting it, are recorded under
 * "Alternatives, and why they are not the design" in
 * [CLI surface shape](../../../docs/plans/cli-surface-shape.md).
