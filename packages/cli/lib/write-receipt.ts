/**
 * The receipt a write leaves behind: the space it landed in, named on stderr
 * once a write has actually happened.
 *
 * A wrong space is not an error. The command succeeds, against data nobody
 * meant to touch, and removing a piece from one space is indistinguishable at
 * the prompt from removing it from another. That is the risk an ambient
 * `CF_SPACE` takes on, and naming the space in what the command prints is what
 * answers it — a receipt rather than a prompt, so it costs a non-interactive
 * caller nothing and leaves a wrong space visible the moment it happens
 * (docs/plans/cli-surface-shape.md, step 8).
 *
 * Three properties are what make it a receipt:
 *
 * - **It follows the write.** Announcing the target beforehand would name a
 *   space the command may never reach, which is a prompt wearing a receipt's
 *   words.
 * - **`--quiet` does not silence it.** A hint is advice; this is a fact the
 *   operator is owed, and a quiet script is the caller least able to notice a
 *   wrong space on its own.
 * - **It is on stderr.** `get` and `call` reserve stdout for machine-readable
 *   output, so a receipt on stdout would corrupt the thing a caller parses.
 *
 * Reported by the functions that write rather than by a list of commands that
 * do, so a new write path carries it by construction and a command that only
 * writes under `--apply` says nothing on a dry run.
