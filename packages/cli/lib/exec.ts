/**
 * Run the callable a mounted file names, and answer with what it produced.

 * A handler is dispatched under an invocation identity, one pair per call.
 * That is what gives this arrival an outcome at all: a handler's result is
 * read back off the receipt its handling files, and a dispatch naming no id
 * files under none. Minting both halves is the same default
 * `resolveInvocationIdentity` applies to a `cf piece call` that names neither
 * — the id is random, so it names an outcome nothing else will ask for.
 * Without it a `--select` over a handler could only ever answer nothing, which
 * is the silence the read options exist to remove.
 *
 * `options.invocation` is how a caller supplies the pair instead, and the
 * command does: the identity a failure is retried under is no use to anyone
 * who cannot read it, so `cf exec` mints it where it can also announce it and
 * name it again if the call fails. The fallback minted here keeps a direct
 * caller — a test, an embedder — from having to care.
