 * A first link seeds an EMPTY contract: v1 does not migrate external files, so
 * the on-disk db owns its schema and the server skips `ensureTables` for a
 * registered source. A RE-link must not re-seed that empty contract over a
 * handle whose `tables` someone has since declared. `tables[].ifc` carries the
 * per-column read labels, and a store's effective label is monotone (§8.12.1) —
 * it may strengthen, never weaken. Overwriting a declared contract with `{}`
 * lowers every column's read label to nothing, and because a contract-less
 * query still returns its rows (`labelResultSchema` labels nothing rather than
 * refusing), the downgrade is silent: same rows, no label, no error.
 *
 * The handle's other fields are as fixed as its labels. `owner` resolves
 * `dbOwner()` row admission, `scope` partitions the db, and `rev` is what every
 * handle hasher reads to decide a query has new inputs — so a re-link that
 * dropped them would rotate row admission and re-issue every live query.
 * Preserving the whole prior value keeps all four properties together.
