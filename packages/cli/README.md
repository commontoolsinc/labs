# @commonfabric/cli

## Launcher Contract

`packages/cli/launcher.ts` is the stable Deno launcher for consumers that need
to run the Common Fabric CLI from another repo or from a sandbox. It keeps the
selected Labs checkout as the source of truth while making the child CLI process
use an explicit Deno config/import map.

The launcher itself intentionally uses only Deno built-ins so callers can invoke
it before the Labs import map is active.

Launcher options are parsed before the first non-launcher argument or `--`. Use
`--` when a `cf` argument has the same name as a launcher option:

```bash
deno task cf -- --config piece-config.json
```

Launcher `--config` is the child Deno config/import map used to start the CLI.
It is not a `cf` command or pattern config.

The child CLI working directory defaults to `INIT_CWD` when present, otherwise
the launcher's current directory. This preserves `deno task cf` behavior from a
caller directory. Direct sandbox or wrapper callers should pass `--cwd` when
they need to ignore a stale inherited `INIT_CWD`.

The child CLI process inherits the parent environment. The launcher only adds
`CF_CLI_NAME=cf`, so caller-provided `CF_API_URL`, `CF_IDENTITY`, experimental
flags, and CFC/sandbox-related environment variables continue to flow through.

From the Labs checkout:

```bash
deno task cf --help
deno task cf check packages/cli/fixtures/pattern.tsx --no-run
```

From a sibling consumer such as Pattern Factory:

```bash
deno run --allow-run --allow-env --allow-read ../labs/packages/cli/launcher.ts \
  -- check workspace/<run-id>/pattern/main.tsx --no-run
```

From a vendored consumer such as Loom:

```bash
deno run --allow-run --allow-env --allow-read vendor/labs/packages/cli/launcher.ts \
  --labs-root vendor/labs \
  --config deno.jsonc \
  -- check .ops/patterns/example.tsx --no-run
```

Use `--launcher-help` for launcher-specific help. Normal CLI flags such as
`--help` are passed through to `cf`.
