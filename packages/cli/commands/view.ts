  `Interactive, syntax-aware pager for transformed patterns, source files and diffs.

A less-like viewer for the dense output of '--show-transformed' and saved source
files. Transformed TypeScript is parsed with the same parser the transformer
uses, so blocks, closures, schemas, type positions and Common Fabric builders
(pattern/lift/handler/…) are colored exactly as the compiler sees them.
Markdown, JSON, JSONC, YAML and Python files use syntax highlighting selected
from language metadata. Python interpreter shebangs select Python. Node, Deno
and Bun shebangs select the TypeScript and JavaScript language family.
Known binary filenames, NUL-containing input and invalid UTF-8 select the binary
language. Its rendered view is a read-only hex dump with control pictures for
bytes that have no printable ASCII character.
Filename-free compiler output keeps TypeScript highlighting when its
transformed-module header identifies it. Other unnamed source and named files
with unrecognized syntax remain plain text. Piped source can select syntax
explicitly with '--language' or supply a virtual name with '--filename'. Either
option suppresses unified-diff auto-detection; use '--diff' instead for a diff.
The Markdown language also has a rendered view that formats headings, lists,
quotes, tables, links, emphasis and code while retaining source line positions.
Source views remain verbatim and add color only.

Raw unified diffs are detected automatically when their structural header is
the first nonblank line. Standard Git commit output is detected from its complete
header. Binary detection examines bytes; other source content is not used to
guess a language. Piping 'git diff' in gives added and removed lines their
tints, full syntax color, a structure tree of the code each hunk touches, and
the semantic features (inferred types, go-to-definition) answered against the
CURRENT state of the workspace files the diff names.

COMMON USAGE:
  cf check ./pattern.tsx --show-transformed --no-run | cf view
  git diff origin/main | cf view        # diff mode
  cf view transformed.ts                # view a saved file
  generate-source | cf view --filename script.py
  cf check ./p.tsx --show-transformed --no-run | cf view --plain | bat

KEYS (press ? in the viewer for the full list):
  ↑/↓ k/j scroll · ←/→ h/l pan · Space/b page · g/G top/bottom · / search
  structure tree: w/s sibling · a/d parent/child · Tab/⇧Tab depth-first
  Enter info card · in it: ↑/↓ pick a reference · Enter opens it · z reveals it
  v source/rendered · t look up a definition · # line numbers · \\ wrap mode · q quit

When stdout is not a terminal (piped/redirected) it prints the colorized text
and exits, like less.`,
