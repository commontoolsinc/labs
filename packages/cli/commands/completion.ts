 * `cf completion` — shell completion scripts and the callback that feeds them.

 * Cliffy ships a `CompletionsCommand`, but its dynamic hook passes the
 * completion callback only `(command, parent)`: no cursor word, and no access
 * to the options already typed. That is enough for a static command tree and
 * nothing more — it cannot answer "the callables of the piece named by the
 * `--cell` on this line". Since the values worth completing in cf are exactly
 * those context-dependent ones (piece ids, callables, cell paths), this command
 * emits its own thin shell functions that forward the whole line instead.

const description = `Generate shell completion scripts.

Completion covers the command tree and, when the line names a reachable space,
live values: piece ids annotated with their names, a piece's callables, cell
paths walked a segment at a time, and locally known spaces.

Live values need an identity and api-url, taken from the line being typed
(-i/-a/-u) or from CF_IDENTITY/CF_API_URL. Without them the command tree still
completes.

These also complete "deno task ${cliName()} ..." — see DENO TASK below.

REQUIRES '${cliName()}' ON PATH:
  The installed function calls '${cliName()} completion complete' on every Tab,
  and swallows its errors, so without a '${cliName()}' on PATH completion
  silently yields nothing — including for "deno task ${cliName()} <TAB>".
  mise puts the checkout's bin/ on PATH; otherwise symlink bin/${cliName()}.
  See "Installing ${cliName()} on PATH" in packages/cli/README.md.

INSTALL (zsh), in ~/.zshrc after compinit:
  source <(${cliName()} completion zsh)

INSTALL (bash), in ~/.bashrc:
  source <(${cliName()} completion bash)
  # or system-wide:
  ${cliName()} completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/${cliName()}

DENO TASK:
  The scripts bind 'deno' as well as '${cliName()}', so "deno task ${cliName()} ..."
  completes too. A deno line that is not a ${cliName()} invocation is handed back
  to deno's own completion. Use --no-deno-task to bind only ${cliName()}.

  This binding needs the script evaluated, not just autoloadable. Installing
  the zsh script into fpath instead ('completion zsh > "\${fpath[1]}/_${cliName()}"')
  completes ${cliName()} itself, but the deno binding waits until ${cliName()} completes
  once. To keep that layout, add after compinit:
    _${cliName()}_deno_previous="\${_comps[deno]:-}"
    compdef _${cliName()} deno

The scripts forward the command line to '${cliName()} completion complete',
so they keep working as commands are added — reinstall only if this CLI moves.`;

/**
 * The callback the installed shell function invokes on every Tab.
 *
 * Accepts either shape of input: zsh forwards its own tokenized `words` with
 * `--cword`, bash forwards the raw buffer with `--line`/`--point` (its own
 * word-splitting mangles `:` and `=`, which cf values are full of).
