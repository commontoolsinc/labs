Shuttle holds one connection and one place — the space, piece and path its
prompt shows — and reads lines against them: cd, ls, pwd, get, wish, and
where, which prints the whole ambient record. The place fills in what a
reference leaves out, so a line names what it acts on rather than repeating
the address.

The connection is fixed for the run: one shuttle serves one space, and
restarting is how to reach another.`),
