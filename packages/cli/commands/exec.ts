 * `cf exec` reaches a verb through a filesystem mount rather than through a

 *
 * **The result cell's address goes to stderr, written the way the next command

 * three as the one token `--piece` parses, the space embedded as its
 * `/@did:.../` prefix. Naming the space is not decoration — `cf exec` takes
 * its space from the mount, while `cf get` falls back to whatever space
 * the caller has configured, so a token that omitted it would suggest a
 * command that reads a different cell.
