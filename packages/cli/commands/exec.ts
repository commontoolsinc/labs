 * `cf exec` reaches a verb through a filesystem mount rather than through a
 * piece address, and that is the whole of the difference between them.
 *
 * **The result cell's address goes to stderr, written the way the next command
 * takes it.** An address has three parts, and `canonicalAddress` renders all
 * three as the one token `--piece` parses, the space embedded as its
 * `/@did:.../` prefix. Naming the space is not decoration — `cf exec` takes
 * its space from the mount, while `cf piece get` falls back to whatever space
 * the caller has configured, so a token that omitted it would suggest a
 * command that reads a different cell.
 *
 * Extracted from the action body so it is unit-coverable: command action
 * bodies never execute under the unit suite (docs/development/COVERAGE.md).

 * furthest phase reached. That phase is the difference between a retry that
 * deduplicates and one that commits a second time — and `cf exec` accepts no
 * `--invocation`, so a retry can only be a fresh pair. Saying so is what lets
 * a caller decide rather than guess. The session completing the pair is
 * already on stderr, announced at dispatch.

 * runs under Cliffy and is unreachable from a unit test; the seams let a test
