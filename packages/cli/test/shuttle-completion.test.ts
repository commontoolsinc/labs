/**
 * Unit tests for what `tab` finishes: the token a line ends in, completed
 * against the verbs and against what stands where shuttle stands.
 *
 * Every read is stood in through the deps bag, so what is under test is which
 * candidates a position offers and what is written back onto the line, with no
 * socket and no server behind any of it. Where a completion lands on the
 * screen is the prompt's (`shuttle-prompt.test.ts`).
 *
 * The verb words are read off the dispatch rather than written here, so a case
 * about "the word that names a verb" stays a case about the table rather than
 * a copy of it that would go quietly stale.
