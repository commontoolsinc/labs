/**
 * The two pure halves of verb documentation, tested directly against
 * constructed schemas: reading an author's prose out of a compiled pattern's
 * result schema, and folding it into the schema a caller is served.
 *
 * Its companion `verb-prose-live.test.ts` drives the same code through
 * `cf piece verbs` and `cf piece call --help` against compiled, run patterns,
 * and that is where the behavior a caller sees is pinned. This file exists for
 * the shapes a compiled pattern does not produce and a served schema may still
 * hold: a reference naming a definition that is not there, a definition that is
 * a boolean, a tuple, an `allOf`. Those are the branches nothing would exercise
 * otherwise, and an unexercised branch is the one that inverts unnoticed.
 *
 * The division is deliberate. A constructed schema is a claim about the world,
 * and this file is careful to make only claims the live file does not need to
 * carry — every position class here that a pattern CAN produce is asserted
 * there as well, against output the compiler actually emitted.
