/**
 * A work item that carries a back-reference: the doubly-linked shape
 * `docs/common/concepts/self-reference.md` documents, reduced to the two
 * fields that close the circle. `addChild` files a child under this item and
 * hands it back, so the returned piece's `parent` is the container and the
 * container's `children` holds the returned piece.
 *
 * Driven against a COMPILED, RUN pattern rather than a hand-built value,
 * because both halves of what is under test are things the runtime constructs
 * and a double would only assert back. The circle has to be a real one — the
 * same object reached from inside itself, through links the runner resolved —
 * and the bound is derived from a declared result the TRANSFORMER lowered,
 * whose recursion is spelled with `$ref`/`$defs` that no hand-written schema
 * would predict.
 *
 * Five verbs, for the answers a readback can give:
 *
 * - `addChild` returns the new item, and its declared result re-enters itself.
 * - `addChildSelf` returns the CONTAINER, so the circle closes through a
 *   collection rather than through a single field.
 * - `addChildLoose` returns the same container behind `unknown`, which
 *   declares a shape that bounds nothing.
 * - `addChildRow` returns the new item behind a COMPACT declaration — two
 *   scalars, re-entering nowhere — which is the shape a verb takes when its
 *   author means the result to be a row rather than the whole piece. Its
 *   circle is at no position that declaration names.
 * - `addChildren` returns an ARRAY of items, which is the one root a
 *   `--filter` can be applied to and so the only way to reach a filtered
 *   readback of a value that closes a circle.
 *
 * One more answer needs no further verb: `addChild` reached on the piece's
 * INPUT cell, under the name `fileUnder`, is a resolution a declared result
 * cannot be keyed to at all. The harness wires that surface up for it.
