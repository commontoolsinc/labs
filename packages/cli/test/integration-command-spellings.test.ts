/**
 * Every `cf` command the integration drills run is written in the spelling the
 * surface blesses.
 *
 * Each command sits under the noun it acts on, and the spelling it replaced is
 * still mounted — hidden from help and from completion, carrying a notice, and
 * guaranteed only until the date `COMMAND_SPELLING_END_DATE` names in
 * `packages/cli/lib/deprecated-spelling.ts`. That mount is what makes a drill's
 * own result no evidence about the spellings it writes: a drill that went back
 * to a superseded one passes every assertion it makes, and keeps passing until
 * the mount is removed, at which point it fails on a day nothing about it
 * changed. So this reads the text of the scripts instead of a run of them.
 *
 * `packages/cli/README.md` carries the same table under "Superseded spellings",
 * as the surface's own record of what to write instead.
 *
 * The scan does not tell a command from a comment, and that is deliberate:
 * prose in a drill that teaches a superseded spelling wants the same edit as a
 * line that runs one.
 *
 * TODO(mike): Delete this file once `cf` mounts no superseded spelling. The
 * scan has nothing left to find then, and a check whose subject is gone reads
 * as a rule about something the CLI still does.
