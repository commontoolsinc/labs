/**
 * Unit tests for `callFromCommand`, the `cf call` action. Every input is an
 * ordinary argument — the command's own arguments, the line past `cf call`,
 * and the words past `--` included — so each case drives the whole action over
 * a stub dispatcher, and what the assertions turn on is what the action built
 * from the argv: the arguments it handed the callable, the target it resolved,
 * the projection it read past the marker, the wait control it derived, the
 * phases it announced, and the outcome it rendered. No runtime, no socket, and
 * no server stands behind any of it.
 *
 * A case reaching a failure exit supplies an `exit` of its own — one that
 * throws, which is the only shape an `exit` typed `never` leaves open — and
 * reads the report off its own sinks rather than losing the runner to
 * `Deno.exit`. `exitPieceCallFailure` rethrows a `ValidationError` instead of
 * exiting, so Cliffy still renders the usage screen for one.
