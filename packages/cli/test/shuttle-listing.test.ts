/**
 * Unit tests for what `ls` finds at a place and how it writes each row back.
 *
 * Every read a listing makes is `packages/cli`'s, and every case that makes
 * one stands its own in through the deps bag, so what is under test is the
 * composing —
 * which read a position takes, what a row carries, and how a row prints — with
 * no socket, no server and no piece behind any of it. What those reads do once
 * called is not this file's subject; that a listing hands each of them the
 * connection this process holds is, and three cases pin it.
 *
 * The connection is a borrowed one throughout. A listing never opens or closes
 * one, so which arm a case stands it up through decides nothing here, and the
 * borrowed arm is the one that needs no opener behind it.
 *
 * The property the file exists for is the last group's: a name `ls` prints is
 * a name `cd` takes back to the row it was printed for. It is driven over a
 * construction rather than a hand-listed few, because the interesting names
 * are the ones nobody thinks to list — and its other half matters as much,
 * that a row it has no operand for prints no name at all.

    // surface invites a reader to type a string that reaches somewhere else.
    //
    // A named row's name column never opens with `<`, which is what keeps a
    // name and a marker apart on one surface. `quoteToken` is the whole of that
    // mechanism and it lives a module away: `<` is one of the characters the
    // grammar reserves, so a name holding one is printed quoted and can never
    // open with it. Nothing in this module would notice if that stopped being
    // true, which is why the assertion is here and the mutation that reds it
    // is in `line.ts`.
    //
    // The property is over the name column of a printed line and not over the
    // whole of it. A line opens with the row's handle, and a row that carries
    // an error prints a marker after the name, so the name is the whole of the
    // line for no row at all; and an error is text the fabric wrote, which may
    // hold an odd quote and leave the line as a whole refusing to split. What
    // holds of every named row is that the name column holds one token `cd`
    // takes back to the row, and that anything after it is separated from it —
    // which is what "copied out of the name column" means and all it can
    // mean.
    //
    // A name is read twice on the way back, and both readings are asked. The
    // option grammar reads it first — a token opening with `-` reaches a verb
    // as a flag and never as an operand — and the place reads what is left. A
    // name the first reading takes therefore fails the property however well
    // it moves, which is why the operand is held against `readsAsOption`
    // beside being moved with.
    //
    // What varies is as load-bearing as the property. Both kinds of row a

    // holds — and each candidate is driven through the read that produces that
