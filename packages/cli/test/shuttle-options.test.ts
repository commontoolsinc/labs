/**
 * Unit tests for how the tokens after a verb divide into options and operands.
 *
 * The parse itself is `cf`'s — `parseFlags` is what `Command` reads a flag on
 * a `cf` line through — so what these cases pin is the composition around it:
 * which table the parse is handed, which of its three answers become the
 * operands and in what order, and what a refusal says past the parser's own
 * sentence. A case that looks as though it tests the parser is testing that
 * the parser is the one reading the line, which is the decision this module
 * carries.
 *
 * The predicate beside the parse is asked against the parse in every case that
 * uses it. Two readings of a token that disagreed would put a name on a
 * listing that `cd` no longer takes, and the pair is the only place that can
 * be seen.
