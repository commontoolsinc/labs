/**
 * Unit tests for the verbs a line names and the dispatch that picks one.
 *
 * Every read a verb makes is `packages/cli`'s, and every case stands its own
 * in through the deps bag, so what is under test is the composing — which read
 * a verb reaches, what it is handed, and what comes back as an outcome — with
 * no socket, no server and no piece behind any of it. One case is the
 * exception and drives the real derivation: which space a name denotes is a
 * fact two callers have to agree about, so that case asks both.
 *
 * The connection is a borrowed one in every case but one. No verb opens or
 * closes one, so which arm a case stands it up through decides nothing here,
 * and the borrowed arm is the one that needs no opener behind it. The
 * exception is `where` over a connection that will not open, which is the one
 * question the arm decides: the borrowed arm has a controller already, so only
 * an owned one can be asked what it answers when the opening fails.
 *
 * Two properties the file exists for run through it. A read never moves the
 * place, and a move never happens twice, so each of the two verbs that resolve
 * an operand is asked what it left behind as well as what it returned. And
 * nothing here writes: the dispatch hands its outcome back, so a prompt drawing
 * its own screen is never written over from underneath.
