/**
 * The exit criterion of the read options: **the same cell, reached four ways,
 * renders identically under the same selection.**
 *
 * One cell is seeded once. Each of the four arrivals — `cf cell get`,
 * `cf piece call`, `cf wish`, `cf exec` — is driven at its own outermost
 * in-process seam against that cell, under one selection, and the four
 * SELECTED VALUES are compared byte for byte. A vocabulary that answers from
 * two starting points and silently does nothing from the other two teaches a
 * rule that is false half the time, and only a comparison across all four can
 * witness that.
 *
 * The selected value is the whole of what is compared here, and deliberately
 * so: the envelope around it is each command's own. A verb arrival wraps its
 * answer in the Invocation JSON, a read arrival writes the value alone, and
 * those bytes therefore differ by design — comparing raw stdout across the
 * four would assert a sameness the commands do not have and should not. What
 * the envelope is, at each arrival, is pinned separately below and in
 * test/exec-read-options.test.ts.
 *
 * The cell is the profile the `#profile` wish resolves to, because that is the
 * one cell a wish can be made to arrive at without inventing a target: a wish
 * resolves a query rather than an address, so the other three arrivals are
 * pointed at what the wish found rather than the other way round.
 *
 * The runtime is real and emulated-storage-backed. Only the piece controller
 * and the callable cell are doubles, and each is the seam its own command
 * resolves through — the selection step under test is the production one in
 * every arrival.
