/**
 * The multi-user orchestrator's `{ label }` / `{ await }` handshake.
 *
 * A marker is a durable write in the shared space, so crossing one means the
 * announcing participant's earlier writes have reached this replica. That is
 * what lets an assertion be read once.
 *
 * What these tests hold in place is that contract as an author meets it: a
 * marker carries state across, a marker announced from a replica that predates
 * another participant's announcement still arrives, a wait outlives a change to
 * the announcer's document that is not the awaited marker, a false assertion is
 * reported for what it read rather than for running out of time, a marker
 * nobody announces is still a deadlock, and an explicit `{ settle: true }` step
 * settles a participant where the author asks for it and the run carries on. The
 * propagation gap itself is too small to observe in a fixture this size — the
 * barrier's discriminating coverage is the pattern-test corpus, where removing
 * it fails seven assertions across `topics`, `lobby`, and `cfc-group-chat-demo`.
 *
 * Also here: the CFC enforcement mode a run names reaches every participant.
 * Each participant builds its own runtime in its own worker, so a mode the
 * orchestrator holds and does not forward leaves every one of them on the
 * preset's rung while the run reads as though it named one.
