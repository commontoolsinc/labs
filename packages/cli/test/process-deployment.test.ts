/**
 * Unit tests for the process's claim on the deployment it connects to: what
 * `claimProcessDeployment` accepts, what it refuses, what it declines to
 * record at all, and how it compares two spellings of one API URL. The claim
 * is a module-level string and nothing else, so each case resets it and calls
 * the function directly.
 *
 * The `loadPieces` cases drive the real thing, which claims ahead of the
 * identity it reads and the flags it fetches from the deployment: a refused
 * connection rejects with the limit's own message, and an API URL no
 * connection can be opened over rejects on the URL itself, leaving the claim
 * free for the corrected one. No runtime, socket, or server stands behind
 * either.
