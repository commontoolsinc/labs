/**
 * The CLI's half of resolving a reference whose slug names a collection: the
 * parse lets a slug's embedded path through where a handle's is refused, a
 * command that takes a piece and nothing inside it walks that path and refuses
 * what the walk leaves, and a command that reads at a path hands the whole
 * addressed path to the reference resolver and reads at what comes back. The
 * walk itself runs against a real runtime in
 * `packages/piece/test/slug.test.ts`; here it is a double, so what is pinned
 * is the plumbing around it.
