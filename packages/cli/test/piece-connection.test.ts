/**
 * Unit tests for the `lib/piece.ts` functions that take the connection as a
 * parameter. The piece behind the connection is a double throughout, so what
 * each function does with one — the value it writes, the piece it removes,
 * the link it makes, the payload it dispatches, the view it returns — is what
 * the assertions turn on, and no socket and no server stand behind any of it.
 *
 * Most of it needs no runtime either. `getPieceView()` is the exception: the
 * inspection it delegates to reads a cell's runtime, so that block builds one
 * over an emulated storage manager and doubles only the piece around it.
