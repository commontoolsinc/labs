/**
 * A `FabricInstance` crossing `Cell.pull()` arrives as a query-result proxy
 * over an empty ordinary stub (the `getPrototypeOf` note in
 * packages/runner/src/query-result-proxy.ts), so prototype and key
 * enumeration on the materialized value cannot tell a real instance result
 * from the value-less witness — a shape check swallowed it as "no result".
 * Presence must come from the receipt's STORED value.
 *
 * The receipt here is a REAL runtime cell written, committed, and read back
 * through the real pull boundary; only the verb dispatch is a double, so the
 * seam under test — readback classification — is the production one. A mock
 * receipt cannot witness this defect at all: it hands back whatever the test
 * decided, never a proxy over an empty stub.
