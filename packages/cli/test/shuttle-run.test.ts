/**
 * Unit tests for running a shuttle: the connection, the place, and the prompt
 * composed into one session.
 *
 * Both ends are stood in for — the connection by an opener the case supplies,
 * and the terminal by one that delivers a scripted line — so what is under
 * test is the composing. A case that wants to know where the place stands asks
 * the session for it, by typing `pwd` at the prompt and reading what came
 * back, which is the only way in that does not reach past the seam.
 *
 * One case stands in for `Deno.consoleSize`, which is a member of the whole
 * process, so this file runs in the serial pass (`SERIAL_TESTS`,
 * `test/run-tests.ts`).
