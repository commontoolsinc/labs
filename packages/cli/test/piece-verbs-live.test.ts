 * The listing's classification is exercised against CELLS THE RUNTIME BUILT,
 * because the defect this pins cannot be reproduced against a double: the
 * forced-stream cast asked a cell "are you a stream?" after casting it to one,
 * and a hand-written double answers from whatever the test decided instead of
 * from the cast. Every data field below was reported as a callable handler,
 * with the field's own schema offered as its input schema.

 * mentions neither verb — while the pattern returns both, and
 * `integration.sh` calls `increment` and asserts the counter moves.
 *
 * Nothing about these two verbs is hidden or unusual; they are simply absent
 * from the type the result cell reads through, so a walk of that cell never
 * proposes their names and never gets as far as classifying them.
 *
 * `hiddenTool` is the same omission for the OTHER kind of callable. A tool is
 * not a stream and is wired to no handler node, so an enumeration keyed on
 * handler nodes cannot propose it however wide it is — and a candidate the
 * declared result type omits arrives with no evidence of its kind except its
 * own stored value, which is what makes classifying it, rather than assuming
 * it, load-bearing.
