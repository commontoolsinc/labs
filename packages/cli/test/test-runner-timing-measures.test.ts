/**
 * Guard for `--timing-measures-out`, whose whole value is that the file it
 * writes describes the run rather than a fragment of it.
 *
 * Each test file starts by clearing the performance timeline, so a capture read
 * once at the end of a multi-file run keeps only the last file and reports its
 * count as though it were the run's. That is invisible in a passing run — the
 * tests still pass, the file still exists, and only the numbers are wrong —
 * which is why it is pinned here rather than left to a reading of the code.
