/**
 * Integration-level guard for the `expectNonIdempotent` test-flag semantics.
 *
 * The flag is an ASSERTION that the idempotency detector fires, not a mere
 * tolerance: a flagged test must FAIL when zero violations are detected
 * (otherwise a detection regression silently defangs the fixtures in
 * packages/patterns/test/non-idempotent/), and must keep PASSING when
 * violations are present. Covers both the single-runtime path (runTests
 * reporting) and the multi-user orchestrator (per-participant aggregation,
 * where ANY flagged participant seeing a violation satisfies the
 * expectation).
