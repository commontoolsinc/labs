/**
 * The `case "$SECTION"` table at the end of integration/fuse-exec.sh chooses
 * which phases a run executes, and each phase records as its own test. CI
 * dispatches the table through `CF_FUSE_INTEGRATION_SECTION` on the FUSE step
 * of the cli-integration-test job, and a run with no section dispatches `all`.
 *
 * The script brings up one FUSE mount and one daemon and then works through a
 * piece on it, so a phase that reached for what a phase in another section
 * left behind would pass under `all` and fail whenever a lane ran its section
 * alone. These hold the table to the properties that make a section
 * schedulable: every phase is reachable, from `all` and from what CI
 * dispatches; the prelude every section depends on runs whichever section was
 * asked for; and the two orderings the script's phases depend on survive.
 *
 * What they read is the text of the table, of the phase functions, and of the
 * workflow. Whether a section really stands alone is settled by running it,
 * which only CI can do.
