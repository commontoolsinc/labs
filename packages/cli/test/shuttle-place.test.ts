/**
 * Unit tests for the place value and the module that owns it. A place is a
 * value and every move over it is a decision about one, so a case stands a
 * `CurrentPlace` somewhere, hands `cd` a string, and reads back both what the
 * move returned and where the instance ended up. No connection, no I/O and no
 * clock stands behind any of it, which is what makes a case per move, per
 * rendering and per refusal affordable.
 *
 * The returned outcome is the half to read first, because only two of the
 * five arms a `Move` has are verdicts: the move landed, or it is refused. The
 * other three report that the operand is one this module does not settle — a
 * `#name` wish target, a reference naming its space by name, and a place
 * standing on a piece, which the fabric has still to be asked to resolve and
 * to find — since settling any of them needs a connection to read over. Their
 * cases pin what gets handed on, and that the place did not move.
 *
 * The pending arm is the one nearly every case meets, a piece being where
 * navigation goes, so `moved()` (`shuttle-place-helpers.ts`) lands one with
 * the piece the operand itself named. That leaves each case saying what it
 * says about the reading and nothing about a resolution; the resolution has a
 * block of its own.
 *
 * A refusal's text is pinned whole, and several of them are somebody else's
 * words. Shuttle consumes the reference grammar rather than forking it, so
 * that grammar's diagnostics reach the reader unaltered, whichever door read
 * the operand — the space-mismatch sentence from `normalizeLLMFriendlyRef`;
 * the invalid-space, unknown-member, scope and duplicate-qualifier sentences
 * from the shared reader (`packages/runner/src/cell-reference.ts`); and the
 * not-a-slug sentence from `validatePieceSegment`, which every door relays and
 * not the reference alone. Each is marked at its case as relayed.
 * When one moves upstream, the fix is to copy the new sentence here, never to
 * match a fragment of it: the whole sentence is what pins that the diagnostic
 * arrives intact, and a substring would let a rewording through that says
 * something else. Other diagnostics from that layer reach a reader without a
 * case here — a piece segment that is no handle and holds a colon, a `@pin=`
 * value of the wrong length — and pinning these is enough to hold the relay
 * itself, since all of them travel the same path.
 *
 * Every other refusal in this file is shuttle's own.
