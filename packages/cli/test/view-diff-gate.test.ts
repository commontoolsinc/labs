// Coverage-gate tests for the C-style quoted-path decoder in lib/view/diff.ts.
// They drive the decoder's malformed-input fallbacks, which the canonical suite
// only reaches with well-formed quoted paths: a backslash as the final byte
// before the string ends (no closing quote), an unrecognized escape character,
// and a quoted path that never closes its quote at all. Each fall-through hands
// the path to the surrounding-quote strip so the name is never dropped.
