/**
 * Unit tests for the prompt: the loop that reads a line, runs it beside the
 * keys, and writes what it produced.
 *
 * Every case drives the whole loop with a scripted key stream and reads back
 * the writes it made, so what is under test is the loop and the bindings — the
 * terminal, the keyboard and the escape sequences are all somewhere else.
 *
 * A case that needs a line to still be running while it types the next keys
 * scripts the keys against the read itself ({@link gated}) rather than against
 * a clock: the stream waits for the read to have started, and the read answers
 * when the stream says so, so which of the two the loop sees first is decided
 * by the case and not by how many microtasks a verb happens to take.
 *
 * The connection is a borrowed one throughout and no case reaches it: a verb
 * that reads stands its read in through the deps bag, so what the prompt does
 * with what a read returned is what these cases turn on.
