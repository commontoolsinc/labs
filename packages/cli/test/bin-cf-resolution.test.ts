/**
 * Which labs checkout `bin/cf` selects.
 *
 * Several checkouts coexisting is normal — worktrees, and a vendored labs
 * inside another repo, a supported layout (see launcher.test.ts) — so an
 * install must not pin `cf` to the checkout it came from. The lookup travels
 * with the script, which is what lets `deno task install-cf` ship a copy.
 *
 * These drive the real script rather than a reimplementation of its rules, and
 * stub each fake checkout's `launcher.ts` with a dependency-free script that
 * prints the root it was run from. Nothing is written inside the repository
 * and no real CLI runs.
