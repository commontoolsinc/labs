// Deno.statSync(abs).isFile. bounded() already canonicalised abs through
// realPathSync, so the stat resolves; the separate try/catch it once carried was
// removed (read() guards the file contents). These tests pin resolve()'s data
// paths — a bounded regular file, a directory, an out-of-bounds path — the ones
// a real `cf view` invocation drives.
