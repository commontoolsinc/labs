/**
 * Unit tests for `sinkCellValue`, the subscription a long-lived caller takes
 * on one cell.
 *
 * What it adds over the sink underneath it is the settling: several fires make
 * one report, the value reported is the one the cell holds once the runtime is
 * quiet, and cancelling stops a report that was already being settled. So the
 * cases drive the fires and the settle separately — the runtime's `idle()` is
 * a promise the case resolves, which is what lets a fire land in the middle of
 * one without any wait on a clock.
 *
 * An injected controller stub is what lets all of that be asserted with no
 * live space.
