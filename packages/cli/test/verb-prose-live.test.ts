/**

 * — a sibling of a `$ref`, a field inside the `$defs` target that `$ref` names,

/**
 * One pattern documented the way an author is told to document one: the verb
 * says what it does where its `Stream` is declared, and each event field says
 * what it means where it is declared.
 *
 * The shapes here are chosen because the two documents the fix reconciles make
 * DIFFERENT inlining choices, measured on this fixture:
 *
 * - `details` is a `$ref` on the declared side and inlined on the served one,
 *   so reaching `details.note` and `details.tags` means following a declared
 *   reference the served document does not have.
 * - `details.tags.items` is a `$ref` on BOTH sides, so its element prose is
 *   already in place — and the served `$ref` must survive, since a caller's
 *   tooling reads that shape.
 * - `primary` is the same `Tag` reached a second way, inlined. It proves the
 *   walk annotates a position without disturbing the shared definition, and
 *   that reaching one definition twice is handled.
 *
 * `rename` carries no prose at all. It is the control: a verb an author has
 * not documented must gain no description, so an implementation that invents
 * one (the property's name, the event type's name, an empty string) fails
 * against it rather than passing everything.
 *
 * `AddEvent.urgent` is the other control, and it is the more interesting one.
 * It is declared, documented, and ABSENT from the schema the verb dispatches
 * through, because the handler's body never reads it and that schema is the
 * handler's read rather than the declared type. So the two documents disagree
 * on shape as well as on prose, and the assertions below pin which one wins:
 * the prose is folded into what a caller is served, never served in its place.
