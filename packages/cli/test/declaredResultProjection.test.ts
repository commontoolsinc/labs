 * The declared result of a verb that hands an item back, with `Item` naming
 * itself through `parent`. That recursion is the only thing a derived bound
 * cuts, so every case here hangs its own position beside `item` and reads how
 * the derivation treats that position while the walk is already cutting
 * somewhere else. A declaration that re-enters nowhere derives no projection
 * at all, which would leave nothing to read.
 *
 * The declaration shapes below are the ones a compiled pattern cannot be made
 * to produce — a reference out of the document, a reference to a name that is
 * not there, a position with no shape under it — which is why they are driven
 * through the derivation directly rather than through a live verb. The
 * recursion they hang off is the same one the transformer lowers, spelled the
 * same way: a local `$ref` into `$defs`.
