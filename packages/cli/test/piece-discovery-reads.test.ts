/**
 * A pattern shaped like the piece this file is about: one verb, a collection
 * whose members are documents of their own, a name, and two inline scalars.
 *
 * The collection is where a real piece's documents are — a board's topics, a
 * note's blocks — so its element type is the widest read anything could take,
 * and `Item` is what a watch under the declared result type would descend
 * into. The scalars and the name are the other half of the surface: they are
 * data, they sit beside the verb in the same result, and a discovery that
 * classifies from anything but the pattern's own declaration has a way to
 * mistake one of them for a callable.
