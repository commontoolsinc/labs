/**
 * The space a command acts on may be stated once in `CF_SPACE` rather than on
 * every invocation, and `--space` overrides it.
 *
 * Four command trees declare the space option through different builders — the
 * shared target options in `piece.ts`, and `globalEnv`/`env` in `acl.ts`,
 * `deps.ts` and `wish.ts` — so one of each is exercised here. A builder that
 * did not get the declaration reports the space as missing, which is the
 * signal each of these reads.
