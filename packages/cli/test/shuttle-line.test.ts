/**
 * Unit tests for the line split and the printer that inverts it. Both halves
 * are pure functions over strings, so a case hands one a string and reads the
 * value back: no connection, no terminal, and no line loop stands behind any
 * of it.
 *
 * Each case is written against one mutation of `src/line.ts` — the one its
 * description forbids — so that a case which stops discriminating stops
 * passing. A case pinning a refusal pins the whole sentence rather than a
 * fragment of it, since a fragment lets a rewording through that says
 * something else.
 *
 * Two of them are checked over a construction rather than over listed
 * outcomes, because a list is a slice of a class and the rest of the class is
 * where a gap hides: that every character the grammar reserves forces
 * quoting, and that a printed value splits back into the one value it was
 * printed from. The construction is where a value nobody would have listed
 * gets driven.
