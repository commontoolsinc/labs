# not work yet. Its companion `verb-session-demo.sh` shows the session as it is
# meant to read; this one is the thing that keeps that honest.
#
# A step may assert a GAP rather than a capability. Such a step fails loudly
# the day its gap closes, so this script is how we find out that a capability
# arrived rather than discovering it months later in a stale document. How
# many are open is tallied as they run and printed on the last line, so no
# prose here can fall out of step with the assertions below.

# Documented in docs/common/verbs/session-walkthrough.md.
#
# It deploys pattern/tracker.tsx and nothing else. That fixture belongs to this
# session alone, so a change to a pattern the product ships can never break a
# demonstration of what driving one through `cf` looks like.
