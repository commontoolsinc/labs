# Reading and writing a piece's cells as something to watch — the half of the
# CLI a caller reaches for before any verb: a shaped read, the two cells one
# piece has and the flag that chooses between them, the `#argument` suffix
# that spells the same choice on an address, the write that runs nothing, the
# step that recomputes, and the wish that answers with an address it had to
# write a cell to find.

# This is a demo, not a test. It narrates each command before running it, so
# the transcript is the artifact.
#
# Every command that runs is one array of words, printed and then run. There
# is no second, prettier spelling of it anywhere in this file: `run` displays
# `"$@"` and executes `"$@"`, and every act re-parses its own displayed line
# and compares the words against the argv that ran, so a line a reader
# retypes is the line that executed — checked, not asserted. `run_stdin`
# renders the `echo … |` half from the same payload it pipes, so the two
# cannot disagree either.
