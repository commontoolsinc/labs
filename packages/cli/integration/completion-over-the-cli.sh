# The completion chain against a live fabric: deploy a piece, then assert what
# a Tab offers at each slot of space -> piece -> verb -> verb fields -> cell
# path -> result shape.
#
# Every provider that reads state is exercised here: the four that reach a
# fabric (pieces, callables, cell paths, link endpoints), the one that reads
# local memory-v2 stores (--space, and the `space` positionals sharing it), the
# one that reads the environment (--api-url), and the pattern-file glob.
#
# What is NOT exercised entry by entry is the rest of the provider table: a
# dozen slots that hand the shell a constant `files` or `dirs` directive and
# nothing else — --datafile, `view <file>`, `exec <mountedFile>`,
# `id did <keypath>`, the space-management directories, and the two entries
# item 16 of the plan records as belonging to commands that declare no options
# at all. They read no state, so a fabric cannot change what they answer, and
# they are asserted one by one — kind and glob — in
# packages/cli/test/completion-providers.test.ts, which is where a constant
# belongs. Nothing here re-checks them, and `deno task check-completion-slots`
# is what catches a slot with no entry at all.
#
# The exception is an option name that means two things on two commands —
# --from, --to, --root, --scope. There the answer turns on which command was
# typed rather than on the name, so both sides of each are asserted below,
# through the real command line rather than through a resolved slot.
#
# The unit tests under packages/cli/test/completion-*.test.ts cover the pure
# half — line resolution, candidate shaping, and the degrade-to-empty path —
# and by construction cannot see a provider that reaches a fabric and comes
# back with the wrong set. Completion swallows every error on purpose, so a
# provider that throws and a provider that has nothing to say are one
# experience at the prompt: silence. This script is what tells them apart.
#
# Two rules follow from that silence, and both are held to below. A slot is
# judged only after the equivalent `cf` command has been run against the same
# target, so an empty candidate list is read as a defect rather than as an
# unreachable fabric. And a candidate is judged by whether the command accepts
# it, not by whether something came back.
#
# It drives `cf completion complete` directly, which is the one command the
# installed shell function calls. The shell functions themselves are a separate
# surface and are not exercised here.
#
# A step may assert a GAP rather than a capability, the way
# `verb-session-gaps.sh` does: such a step fails loudly the day its gap closes,
# so a slot that starts answering announces itself instead of aging into a
# stale plan. How many are open is tallied as they run and printed on the last
# line, so no prose here can fall out of step with the assertions below.
#
# Documented in docs/plans/cli-completion-coverage.md, whose item 18 this is.
#
# It deploys pattern/completion-target.tsx and nothing else. That fixture
# belongs to this walkthrough alone, so a change to a pattern the product ships
# can never break a demonstration of what a Tab offers.
