# Bulk piece operations as something to watch — the whole built surface of
# docs/plans/piece-bulk-operations.md, live rather than asserted: a board of
# 113 members surveyed in one process, the plan it emits, the retarget stamp,
# the containment refusal, a repair (a fixer run dry, applied from its own
# plan, and resumed as landed), the retarget that plan carries applied over
# grouped sessions, the after-survey diffed against the plan it verifies, and
# the reversal derived from that same plan and applied — down to one piece
# returned to one revision of its own log.
#
# This is a demo, not a test. It narrates each command before running it, so
# the transcript is the artifact. Its companion `bulk-survey-drill.sh` asserts
# the same surface as pass/fail in CI and is what keeps this one honest.
#
# Every command that runs is one array of words, printed and then run. There
# is no second, prettier spelling of it anywhere in this file: `run` displays
# `"$@"` and executes `"$@"`, and every act re-parses its own displayed line
# and compares the words against the argv that ran, so a line a reader
# retypes is the line that executed — checked, not asserted. Unlike the
# verb-session demo this one carries no `broken` helper: nothing in the
# running surface is defective, and that helper arrives when an act needs its
# claim.
