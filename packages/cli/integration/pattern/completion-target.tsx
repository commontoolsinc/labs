/**
 * Fixture for the completion walkthrough (`completion-over-the-cli.sh`).
 *
 * It exists so the walkthrough owns its subject: the shipped patterns are used
 * elsewhere, and a change to one of them should never break a demonstration of
 * what a Tab offers. Nothing else deploys this file.
 *
 * Every element here is a slot of the completion chain — space, piece, verb,
 * verb fields, cell path, result shape — so the walkthrough can name a
 * candidate set rather than assert that something came back:
 *
 * - `settings` is a nested object, so a cell path completes more than one
 *   segment deep.
 * - `items` holds child pieces, so a path crossing a `$link` boundary has a
 *   boundary to cross.
 * - `addItem` declares two fields and a doc comment; `renameItem` declares
 *   three; `sweep` declares none. Together they are the vocabulary a verb's
 *   flags come from and the prose a candidate is annotated with.
 * - `legacyAdd` is `@deprecated`, which the default verb listing holds back —
 *   so the walkthrough can ask whether completion agrees with the listing.
 * - `Item` carries a callable named `record` on its result cell AND is handed
 *   one of that name in its arguments, which is the shadowing rule the verbs
 *   listing states and the one no table walk can reach.
