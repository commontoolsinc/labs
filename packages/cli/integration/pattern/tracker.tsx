/**
 * Fixture for the CLI verb-session demo (`docs/common/verbs/session-walkthrough.md`).
 *
 * It exists so the demo owns its subject: the shipped patterns are used
 * elsewhere, and a change to one of them should never break a demonstration of
 * what driving a pattern through `cf` looks like. Nothing else deploys this
 * file.
 *
 * A work-item tracker, chosen because a tree with cross-links is where
 * addresses stop being a convenience and become the only correct answer: one
 * item can be a child of a second and blocked-on by a third, and only an
 * address tells a caller those are the same item rather than three copies.
 *
 * The board holds root items only. Everything deeper is reachable through
 * `children`, which is what makes an unshaped read of `items` expand the whole
 * tree — the cost that shaped reads exist to bound.
