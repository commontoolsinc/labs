# The verb-result walkthrough: deploy a pattern, introspect its verbs, call
# them, and read what they return.
#
# Documented in docs/common/verbs-over-the-cli.md, which explains the model
# this exercises. Keep the two in step: the doc is the explanation, this is the
# proof, and each names the other.
#
# It deploys pattern/verb-results.tsx and nothing else. That fixture belongs to
# this walkthrough alone, so a change to a pattern the product actually ships
# can never break a demonstration of how the CLI verb surface works.
#
# Every step names the property it asserts, so a failure says which one broke
# rather than just exiting nonzero. A fresh space per run, no prior state.
#
# Run standalone against any host:
#   API_URL=http://localhost:8000 packages/cli/integration/verbs-over-the-cli.sh
#
# Against a host that needs a particular key:
#   API_URL=https://<host> CF_IDENTITY=~/.config/commonfabric/identity.key \
#     packages/cli/integration/verbs-over-the-cli.sh
#
# CI runs it through integration.sh's `piece-call` section (the
# cli-integration matrix in .github/workflows/deno.yml); the `verbs` section
# is the standalone selector for running just this script by hand.
