# The bulk-operations drill: deploy a board whose members are created
# through its own verb, survey it, assert the plan — repair it: a fixer run
# dry with every plan row recording its precondition and fixer, applied from
# that plan, resumed as all-landed writing nothing, and a field-dropping
# fixer refused by name — and retarget it: the stamped plan applied to
# completion, a run killed midway and finished by re-invocation, an edited
# source refused with every unattempted piece named, a piece moved elsewhere
# stopping the run, and the after-survey diffed against the plan it verifies.
# Stages 1 through 3 of docs/plans/piece-bulk-operations.md, which finishes
# each stage with a CI drill so "does the migration tooling still work?"
# stays a CI result.
#
# It deploys pattern/bulk-board.tsx (members from pattern/bulk-member.tsx, a
# separate module so member and board identities differ, the way topic.tsx
# sits beside the topics board's main.tsx) and retargets them onto
# pattern/bulk-member-v2.tsx — the checked-in fixture pair the design calls
# for, a trimmed prior generation and a current one, so the drill reds when
# bulk operations break rather than when a real pattern changes. The fixtures
# belong to this drill alone.
#
# Every step names the property it asserts. A fresh space per run, no prior
# state, no store access — the survey is API-only.
#
# Run standalone against any host:
#   API_URL=http://localhost:8000 packages/cli/integration/bulk-survey-drill.sh
#
# CI runs it through integration.sh's `piece-call` section; the
# `bulk-survey-drill` section is the standalone selector.
