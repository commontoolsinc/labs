# The verb session as it is meant to read: a work tracker driven entirely
# through `cf`, with no tooling written for it.
#
# This is a demo, not a test. It narrates each command before running it, so
# the transcript is the artifact. Its companion `verb-session-gaps.sh` asserts
# the same surface as pass/fail and is what keeps this one honest.
#
# docs/common/verbs/session-walkthrough.md is the prose half: why the fixture
# declares the verbs it does, and which shape of the surface each act is here
# to show. An act added here without a row there is an act nobody can place.
#
# Every command in the transcript is one array of words, printed and then run.
# There is no second, prettier spelling of it anywhere in this file: `run` and
# `broken` display `"$@"` and execute `"$@"`, so a line that reads well and a
# line that ran cannot drift apart. What a reader sees is what they can retype,
# given the two environment variables the header names.
#
# Every act carries a claim, and the script checks all three kinds: an
# unmarked act says the command works, a REFUSED one says the surface turns
# this down, and a BROKEN one says a named defect is still there. Two further
# helpers, `pending` and `broken`, are defined and unused today — they are how
# an unbuilt or defective capability stays deliberately visible rather than
# being quietly omitted. Each carries its full contract at its definition
# below; a reader who never sees one fire does not need them here.
