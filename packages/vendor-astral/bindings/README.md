# Astral Bindings

Astral binds to the Chrome DevTools Protocol (and maybe more in the future!),
and those need to be written somehow. The CDP is HUGE, and writing bindings by
hand would take so long that they would be out of date by the time that they
were finished.

This folder contains these protocol bindings. Celestial is the name of our
home-grown CDP bindings. We hope to have bindings to the safari equivalent of
this protocol soon (and that project will probably be under the name
"Etherial").
