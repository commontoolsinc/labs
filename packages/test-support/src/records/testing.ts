 * This is how a producer's opt-in is pinned: a caller that did not ask for
 * records gets an empty array back even though recording was on for the
 * whole body.
 *
 * The variable it sets is the whole process's, so a test file calling this
 * runs alone. Under a runner that puts several test files on threads of one
 * process — `deno test --parallel`, which `packages/cli/test/run-tests.ts`
 * uses — the file belongs on that runner's serial list.
