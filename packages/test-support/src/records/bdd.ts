/**
 * `describe` and `it`, wrapped so that an invocation can be asked not to
 * run one of them.
 *
 * A test's identity is the name its runner reports, which for a file
 * written this way is the describe chain joined with `" > "`, opening
 * with the root suite the runner invents for a file whose hooks sit
 * outside every `describe`.
 * Registration does not follow that shape: `describe` registers one
 * `Deno.test` and every `it` inside it is a step within that one test, so
 * the preload's wrapper around `Deno.test` sees the container and never
 * the leaves. Reaching a leaf therefore needs a second interception, and
 * this is it.
 *
 * No test file changes. The root import map points `@std/testing/bdd` at
 * this module and the real one at a second specifier, so every file keeps
 * its own `import { describe, it } from "@std/testing/bdd"` and what that
 * specifier means changes once, centrally.
 *
 * A listed test is registered through `it.ignore` rather than dropped, so
 * it appears in the run's output and in its JUnit report as skipped and
 * the store learns it was deliberately not run instead of watching the
 * identity disappear.
 *
 * An invocation with no capture installed gets the real functions back
 * whole; see `capturing`.
