/**
 * The `describe` and `it` this repository's import map resolves to.
 *
 * What matters is that the wrapper is transparent: every way the real
 * ones can be called still registers, and a call the wrapper does not
 * model reaches the real function untouched rather than being dropped.
 * The shapes below are registered for real, and a run with a capture
 * installed puts each of them through the wrapper. A run without one
 * gets the real functions back, so what the shapes prove there is that
 * the file states them as the real functions accept them; the wrapper's
 * own behavior is asserted against it directly further down, and
 * through a recording run in preload.test.ts.
