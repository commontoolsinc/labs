/**
 * What a whole message costs to cross the worker connection, against what the
 * same message cost before the envelope encoding carried it.
 *
 * `data-model`'s `bench/ipc-status-quo.bench.ts` measures the encoding's own
 * contribution: encode, `postMessage()`, decode. This file measures the
 * crossing that contribution sits inside, which is the larger thing and the
 * one a reader means by "what does a message cost". The walks around the codec
 * predate it and are unchanged by it, so a ratio taken across the codec alone
 * overstates what the connection as a whole pays.
 *
 * The subject is a cell update travelling worker to client, which is the
 * connection's highest-volume message. Both arms run the same four steps and
 * differ only in the two the envelope added:
 *
 * | | status quo | envelope |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | worker: convert cells to links | yes | yes |
 * | worker: redact carried label views | yes | yes |
 * | worker: encode | -- | yes |
 * | `postMessage()` | yes | yes |
 * | client: decode | -- | yes |
 * | client: hydrate refs into handles | yes | yes |
 *
 * Every step is inside the timed region, including both encodes, because both
 * are what a sender pays. One message is in flight at a time: an iteration is
 * one round trip, and a pipeline of overlapping sends would report throughput
 * while the harness is timing latency.
 *
 * Payloads are records carrying links, since what these walks cost turns on
 * containers visited rather than bytes moved, and a link is what a converted
 * cell becomes. A payload the status quo cannot carry at all is deliberately
 * absent: timing a crossing that arrives damaged against one that arrives
 * whole yields a ratio that reads as a regression and says nothing.
 *
 * Run with:
 *
 *     deno task bench
