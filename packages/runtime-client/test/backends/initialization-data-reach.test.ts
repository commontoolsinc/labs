/**
 * Where each field of an `InitializationData` lands inside the worker.
 *
 * The host builds that payload field by field and the worker takes it apart in
 * three places: `browserWorkerParamsFromInitializationData` hands part of it
 * to the runtime preset, `RuntimeProcessor.initialize` reads the rest, and the
 * message loop in `client-registry.ts` reads one field before the processor
 * exists. A field none of the three reads crosses `postMessage` whole and then
 * configures nothing, so the host declares one posture and the worker runs
 * another.
 *
 * `REACH` is keyed by `keyof Required<InitializationData>`, which is what
 * closes the claim: a field added to the type is a type error here until it
 * names what the worker builds from it and takes a case asserting that. Every
 * field the payload declares reaches the worker, so there is no arm for one
 * that does not.
 *
 * The key set is that type's own, so the claim is over the payload's top
 * level, which is where the hazard is: a top-level field travels only because
 * a hand-written literal names it. A flag added inside `experimental` needs no
 * case of its own, because that record crosses as one value and is spread into
 * the runtime's resolved flags whole.
