 * All four fields are needed to tell two cells apart: an id alone names a
 * document in every space that stores it, one id in two scopes is two
 * documents, and two paths into one document are two cells.
 *
 * The two exclusions are what separate this from `CellHandle.equals()`, which
 * weighs `cfcLabelView` as well. That view is a display copy which drifts
 * while CFC settles, so two handles on one cell can carry different views;
 * a caller asking whether it has the same cell wants those to agree, and
 * weighing the view would have it decide they are different cells for as
 * long as the drift lasted. Schema is out for the converse reason:
 * `asSchema()` answers with another handle on the same cell, and a lens over
 * a cell is not a different cell. Equality that weighs either belongs to a
 * caller comparing HANDLES; this answers about cells.
 *
 * Structural rather than joined text, so a path segment holding a separator
 * cannot spell another cell's key.
