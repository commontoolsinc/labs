 * message. A caller that records what it answered needs to know which, so that
 * a failure is not counted as the reply it replaced.
 *
 * The message is encoded whole rather than field by field, which is what lets
 * a payload carry the entire `FabricValue` domain -- a `bigint` as itself, a
 * `FabricBytes` as bytes, an instance with its class -- where structured clone
 * alone would strip an instance to `{}`. The envelope is a record of fabric
 * values and so is a `FabricValue` itself, which is what makes encoding it
 * whole well-defined.
 *
 * No `LiveEnvironment` is given, so a value that asks for a cell throws here.
 * Nothing should: `convertCellsToLinks()` turns every live cell into a link
 * before a payload reaches this point, and a throw would say that something
 * does not.
