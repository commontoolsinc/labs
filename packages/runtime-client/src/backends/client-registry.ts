/**
 * The clients of one worker's runtime, and the message loop each of them is
 * served by.
 *
 * A worker runs exactly one runtime. The first client to arrive stands it up;
 * every later client attaches to the one already running, over a duplex of its
 * own. What a client owns is namespaced by the client -- its subscriptions,
 * its mounts, what its departure takes down -- and what governs it is not: the
 * runtime's security context is settled at initialization, and an attach
 * asserting a different one is refused rather than merged.
 *
 * How a duplex reaches this worker is deliberately not this module's business.
 * {@link RuntimeClients.attach} takes anything shaped like a `MessagePort`, so
 * a port carried by a page's opener, one relayed by a native shell, and one a
 * test builds from a `MessageChannel` are the same thing here.
