// Guards a value against the one lossy step between the runner and an external
// LLM provider: the request is sent as ordinary JSON (`JSON.stringify`), so any
// value it carries that plain JSON cannot represent faithfully reaches the
// provider altered, dropped, or not at all -- or crashes the serialization.
//
// The Common Fabric value model is a superset of JSON, so a generated schema
// (a `generateObject` schema, or a tool's `inputSchema`) may legitimately hold
// values JSON cannot carry. Those are fine internally. Crossing to a provider,
// they are not.
//
// The generic detection of JSON-unfaithful values lives in
// `@commonfabric/pure-json`; this module adds only the provider-framed
// assertion that refuses such a value at the transport boundary.
//
// A minor diagnostic point: the thrown message renders the root pointer as `/`.
// Under RFC 6901 the root is `""` and `/` names a property whose key is the
// empty string; the message trades that strict accuracy for legibility.
