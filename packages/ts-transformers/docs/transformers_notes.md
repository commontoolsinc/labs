# OpaqueRef Transformer Status & Roadmap

_Last updated: 2025-09-17_

## Overview

`@commontools/ts-transformers` now houses our TypeScript AST transformers. The
package exposes the modular OpaqueRef rewrite we ship to recipe authors (via
`createModularOpaqueRefTransformer`). The legacy
`createOpaqueRefTransformer` remains inside `@commontools/js-runtime` only until
that package migrates; it is no longer re-exported here. This document captures
the current implementation, outstanding gaps, and the focused roadmap we intend
to pursue.

## Current Implementation

### Architecture Snapshot

- **Rule-based passes** – We run a small, ordered array of rule modules (currently
  JSX expressions and schema injection) over each source file. Each rule
  performs targeted rewrites and requests imports through a shared transformation
  context.
- **Shared context** – `core/context.ts` centralises the TypeScript checker,
  cached type lookups, flag tracking (e.g., JSX depth), diagnostic reporting, and
  import management.
- **Dependency analysis** – `opaque-ref/dependency.ts` walks expressions to
  collect reactive dependencies, handles most scope boundaries, and records
  provenance so map callbacks typed as `any` can still be derived.
- **Rewrite helpers** – `opaque-ref/rewrite/**` modules handle property access,
  binary/call/template expressions, ternaries, unary `!`, and container rewrites
  using a common binding plan. Import requests are applied at the end of the
  pass.
- **Tests** – Fixture-based suites in `packages/ts-transformers/test` cover AST
  parity for JSX, schema integration, handler schema transforms, and the new map
  callback regression test.

### Recent Improvements

- **Map callback parity** – parameters annotated as `any`/`number` now derive
  correctly inside `.map` callbacks.
- **Unary `!`** – predicates like `!flag` wrap into `derive` where necessary.
- **Docs fixture** – `opaque-ref-cell-map` fixture reproduces the ct-891 case so
  we keep coverage on the new transformer.
- **Optional import handling** – the modular path defers import insertion until
  all rules run, preventing duplicate helper imports.

## Known Gaps

| Area | Impact | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Optional-chain predicates** | `!cellRef?.length` still bypasses `derive`, so
  runtime may read a `Cell` eagerly. | Need dependency support for
  `PropertyAccessChain` and a rewrite that preserves optional semantics. |
| **Closures** | Functions that capture reactive values (e.g.
  `() => count + 1`) aren’t rewritten, so callbacks read opaque values at
  runtime. | Requires capture analysis and a closure rewrite rule. |
| **Destructuring / spread** | Patterns like `const { name } = user` or
  `{ ...config, count: count + 1 }` still operate on raw refs. |
| **Async/await & template literals** | Reactive identifiers inside
  `await` expressions or template strings aren’t wrapped automatically. |
| **Testing depth** | No unit or perf suites beyond fixtures; closure/optional
  scenarios lack runtime integration coverage. |

## Near-Term Roadmap

1. **Optional-chain predicate support**
   - Extend dependency normalisation to recognise optional property/element
     chains.
   - Update the unary rule to emit `derive(cellRef, ref => !(ref?.length))`.
   - Add fixtures and unit coverage.

2. **Closure capture rewriting**
   - Introduce a capture-aware dependency walk that builds a lightweight scope
     tree.
   - Add a closure rule that wraps captured reactive values in derives inside
     arrow functions/function expressions.
   - Cover map callbacks, inline handlers, and nested closures.

3. **Destructuring & spread support (scoped exploration)**
   - Evaluate the minimal rewrites needed for object/array destructuring and
     object spreads; prioritise the patterns used in recipes once closure work
     lands.

4. **Test enhancements**
   - Add focused unit tests for the new dependency helpers.
   - Expand fixtures with optional-chain, closure, and destructuring scenarios.
   - Wire a smoke runtime test that exercises the modular transformer end-to-end
     (likely in `js-runtime`).

## Longer-Term Considerations

- **Async transformations** – Once closures are handled, assess whether wrapping
  reactive values inside template literals and `await` chains is still a blocker
  for recipes.
- **Performance & diagnostics** – If rule count grows, revisit lightweight
  instrumentation (timing, rule-level debug logging) rather than the heavy
  “transformation engine” originally proposed.
- **Legacy transformer sunset** – Coordinate the timeline for deleting the
  `js-runtime` copy of `createOpaqueRefTransformer` once the modular path covers
  closures and optional chaining, and `js-runtime` consumes `ts-transformers`
  by default.
