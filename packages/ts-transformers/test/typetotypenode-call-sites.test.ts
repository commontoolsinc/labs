// STATIC SWEEP — bypass guard for the type→TypeNode chokepoint.
//
// `typeToTypeNodeWithRegistry` (src/ast/type-building.ts) is the sanctioned way
// to convert a ts.Type into an emittable TypeNode: it normalizes commonfabric
// refs to `__cfHelpers.X` and registers the node in the typeRegistry. A raw
// `checker.typeToTypeNode(...)` call does neither, so any new raw call site is a
// latent source of two bug classes we've already hit:
//   1. inline `import("commonfabric").X` leaking into emitted type args
//   2. unregistered emitted nodes silently degrading generated schemas
//
// This test pins the exact set of raw call sites. When you add or remove one,
// this test fails — forcing a conscious choice: route it through the chokepoint,
// or add it here WITH a justification (it's genuinely internal-only / is the
// chokepoint's own implementation). The goal is that "raw typeToTypeNode" is
// always a reviewed decision, never an accident.
//
// NB: both bug classes share THIS producer set. The registry-degradation class
// can't be caught at the consumer (SchemaGenerator) — by the time a degraded
// node reaches it, the node has already been rewritten to an `unknown`-bearing
// form, indistinguishable from an intentional `unknown`. So the producer-side
// sweep below is the practical guard for the registry class too: migrating an
// emit-reaching site to the chokepoint closes BOTH the import-leak and the
// registry-degradation risk at once (the chokepoint normalizes AND registers).
// Entries that can emit a concrete (non-keyword) type are marked [emit+concrete].

  //     commonfabric refs possible) with a custom null-literal/undefined-keyword

  //     replacement; never emitted directly.
