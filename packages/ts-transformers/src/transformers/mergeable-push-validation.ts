/**
 * Mergeable Push Validation Transformer
 *
 * Flags a handler that reads a collection (an explicit `.get()` or an
 * iteration) and mergeable-`push`es to that same collection, when the read
 * actually matters to the push.
 *
 * A mergeable `push` commits as a tail-relative `append` and drops the op's own
 * array read from conflict detection so disjoint appends merge. An explicit
 * read of the same collection stays in the conflict set, so two concurrent
 * appends conflict and the loser retries. The capability analysis classifies
 * how the read relates to the push, and the diagnostic says the matching
 * thing:
 *
 * - `read-dependent-push` — the push depends on the read through a guard (the
 *   dedup-then-push shape) or through the pushed value. The intent is better
 *   expressed as an identity-addressed `addUnique` (no retry) for a uniqueness
 *   condition, or a read-modify-write `set` for other content-dependent
 *   appends.
 * - `independent-read-modify-write` — the read feeds a different write to the
 *   same collection (the append-then-trim shape). The append still forfeits
 *   merging; the remedy is to keep the independent read-modify-write in its
 *   own handler.
 *
 * A read unrelated to both the push and any sibling write is not reported: the
 * append does forfeit merging, but there is usually no better expression, so
 * warning would be noise. It is a warning, not an error: the shape stays safe
 * today (the kept read forces the retry), so this nudges toward the better
 * expression without failing the build.
