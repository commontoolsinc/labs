it shows variable 3 compact month views at the top (default June, July, August 2025) and allows participants (default Alice) to pick a color and indicate their availability for a given activity. 

when new activities are added, all participants see them and can add their availability. when creating a new activity the active user can specify details like title, description, location, and duration. when a given user is in control, the other users colors become lighter shades, and they click calendar dates to indicate their availability with a colored circle. when a day is selected by multiple participants, place the active participant color behind the others and divide the colors evenly (like a pie chart) to show them all within the circle.

Recommend the 3 best timeframes for the trip based on degree of overlap relative to the activity duration. if there is any overlap, outline the best dates in black.

double clicking toggles the entire week's availability (Sunday through Saturday)

default participants: alice, bob, eve

default activities: Summer Camp (duration 5 days), Monterey Bay Aquarium (duration 1 day), Lake Tahoe (duration 3 days), Beach Day (duration 1 day), Zoo (duration 1 day)

There is a root item in the list that looks the same as the others but can not be deleted.  If one doesn't exist, add one and name it "Root".

Outliner tool that has two modes.

   - The first root item appears like all other items, but can never be deleted.

   - In Nav mode

      - Pressing CMD-RETURN inserts a NEW LIST ITEM on the same level as the ACTIVE SELECTION and switches to Edit mode.  IF ACTIVE SELECTION has indented children, the NEW LIST ITEM appears below all children.

      - Keep track of the hierarchical level of the item as well as the parent. Display the level and item text from the parent in gray to the right of the item.

      - Ensure that items never advance more than one hierarchical level in either direction per key press.

      - The hierarchical level of each ACTIVE SELECTION can be increased or decreased with TAB and SHIFT-TAB.

         - Pressing TAB demotes (indents) the ACTIVE SELECTION one level making it a child of the item above.  If there is a hidden item directly above, show that hierarchy at this time.

         - Pressing SHIFT-TAB promotes (unindents) the ACTIVE SELECTION.

         - Show a disclosure triangle next to any item that has children. Pressing left arrow hides and right arrow shows or single clicking on the disclosure triangle directly toggles.

         - Change the active selection with the up and down arrow keys.  Skip items not shown due to disclosure triangles setting.

      - DELETE deletes the ACTIVE SELECTION

      - Pressing CMD-E or double-clicking an item switches to Edit mode.

   - In Edit mode

      - Edit mode allows editing the text of the ACTIVE SELECTION.  It begins by selecting the existing text or inserting the cursor if there is no text.

      - Pressing escape, up arrow, down arrow, or return switches to Nav mode and selects the current item as active.

Make the UI clean and Apple-like.

   - Include a button to add list items and an indication of Nav or Edit mode at the top of the screen.

   - Make all buttons subtle and minimal.

   - Include a subtle version number in the corner: 0.01`,
