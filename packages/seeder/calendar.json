In this talk, we dive into the retrieval step of a RAG system using a real-world case study: a technical documentation support bot for Weights & Biases. We walk through how we designed and applied custom retrieval evaluations, uncovering insights that would have been missed by using only public benchmarks like MTEB. You'll learn a practical, reusable framework for diagnosing and improving retrieval performance in your own application. Whether you're launching your first RAG application or debugging a live system, this talk will help you build evaluations that reflect your users and your data.\n\n\n",

    "description": "As large language models grow in complexity and capability, evaluating them rigorously across tasks and providers remains an open challenge. Inspect, developed by the UK AI Security Institute, is an open-source Python framework that brings the principles of software testing, modular composition, and reproducible research to the domain of LLM evaluation. Designed to support flexible pipelines—including prompt engineering, tool usage, multi-turn dialog, and model-graded scoring—Inspect enables researchers and developers to define and run evaluations using declarative, composable components. This talk will walk through Inspect’s architecture, including its integration with the VS Code extension for interactive development, support for dozens of major model APIs, and a rich logging system for experiment tracking and visualization. We’ll explore how Inspect’s structured approach draws from practices in literate programming, functional pipelines, and schema-driven modeling—offering a perspective highly aligned with the values of the data science and open-source tooling communities.",

In this session, I'll be sharing what the companies that actually have AI in production and successfully implemented evals have in common - they are representative of business metrics.

    "description": "Learn how to drive 50%+ CTR lift on natural language search results from two production case studies - a jobs marketplace and a hotel search aggregator. In both cases, the data being searched contains many unstructured properties (text and in the hotel case also images) and even more structured properties like numbers, locations, lists of categorical data and more - which often cause difficulties in traditional vector search systems. Additionally, to disambiguate broad queries and to handle situations where no query is available but we still want to show the user relevant results (home page, email marketing etc), we make heavy use of behavioral data to improve our understanding of both the searched content and the users interacting with the system.",

    "description": "We have two types of Show and Tells:<br><ol><li><b>Showcase </b>[Monthly] - These are designed for anyone in the friends group to attend. They have larger demos summarizing progress in the last month, and will have more exposition and description of what they are and how they fit in. If you can only come sometimes, prioritize these! These show and tells are recorded.</li><li><b>Inside Baseball</b> [Weekly] - These are designed for people who are following along closely. The demos will be of smaller things with much less exposition about why they exist and how they fit into the bigger picture. There will be much for discussion after each demo. Friends are welcome to attend, but if you can only attend some show and tells, you should prioritize the showcases. These show and tells are <i>not </i>recorded.</li></ol>",
