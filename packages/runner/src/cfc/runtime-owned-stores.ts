 * the reactive updates, event handlers and settled requests that fill such a

 * `Runtime.edit` hands this object to every transaction it creates, which is

 * its own out when it stops. That is what bounds this: a list operation mints
 * one piece per element, so an enrollment that lived for the process would
 * grow with every element a churning list ever held.
