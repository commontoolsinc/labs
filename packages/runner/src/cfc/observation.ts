 * both-direction property `fits(L, meet(C1,C2)) ⟺ fits(L,C1) ∧ fits(L,C2)`,
 * tested exhaustively in `cfc-clause-meet.test.ts`.
 *
 * The clause meet is the pairwise alternative-set UNION (plan decision 6,
 * corrected 2026-07-02): for every pair `(c₁ ∈ a, c₂ ∈ b)` emit the clause
 * with alternatives `alts(c₁) ∪ alts(c₂)`. Ceiling clauses sit on the
 * demanding side of subsumption (`alts(c) ⊆ alts(l)`, see
 * `atomsOutsideCeiling`), so the union demands what both parents demand:
 * `alts(c₁) ∪ alts(c₂) ⊆ alts(l)` holds iff both `c₁` and `c₂` subsume `l`
 * (soundness), and any label clause fitting both ceilings has witnesses
 * `c₁, c₂` whose union subsumes it (completeness). Do NOT intersect
 * alternative sets — fewer alternatives is a WEAKER demand, so intersection
 * loosens: `meet([{anyOf:[A,B]}], [{anyOf:[B,C]}])` as intersection gives
 * `[B]`, admitting label `[B]` that ceiling `[{anyOf:[A,B]}]` alone rejects.
 *
 * Flat/flat behavior: an equal-atom pair unions to a singleton that
 * `normalizeClause` unwraps back to the bare atom, so shared atoms survive
 * exactly as under the previous atom intersection; a cross pair of distinct
 * atoms becomes `{anyOf:[a,b]}` — decision-equivalent for flat labels (a bare
 * label atom is never subsumed by a two-alternative clause) but strictly more
 * precise for OR-labels, which the plain intersection wrongly rejected. The
 * result is O(|a|·|b|) clauses; fine for the sole production consumer
 * (`effectiveObservationCeiling` in builtins/llm-dialog.ts: pattern bound ∧
 * per-sink deployment ceiling, both tiny). Should a large-ceiling consumer
 * appear, dropping cross pairs is a sound over-restriction (it only
 * tightens); intersecting alternative sets never is.
 *
 * Each union clause is normalized (`normalizeClause`: dedup + canonical
 * order + singleton unwrap) and result clauses dedup via `clausesEqual`, so
 * order-differing spellings of the same clause coalesce. No absorption pass:
 * a redundant wider clause may sit beside a narrower one that subsumes
 * strictly more — harmless, it admits only a subset of what the narrower
 * clause admits (decision 4: measure before optimizing).
 *
 * Edge cases (each preserves `cfcObservationFitsCeiling` semantics):
 * - `undefined` ceiling = "no ceiling" = allow everything, so it is the
 *   identity: `meet(undefined, x) === x` and `meet(x, undefined) === x`.
 * - A declared empty ceiling is "public only"; it forms no pairs, so
 *   `meet([], x)` is `[]` — the strict bound wins.
 * - A malformed empty-alternative clause `{anyOf:[]}` never subsumes
 *   (`clauseSubsumes` fails closed), so it contributes nothing to its own
 *   ceiling and must form no pairs either — pairing it would emit its
 *   partner clause verbatim and loosen the meet past the empty-clause
 *   parent.
 *
 * Used to fold a deployment per-sink ceiling into a pattern-supplied observation
 * bound so post-commit LLM tool-loop reads cannot exceed the deployment ceiling
 * (review follow-up to #3993).
