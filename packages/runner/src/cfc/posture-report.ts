/**
 * The one posture record: what a runtime is actually enforcing, in a shape
 * every surface that publishes it publishes identically.
 *
 * A deployment whose enforcement dials cannot be read off it is
 * indistinguishable from a default one, so an operator has no way to confirm
 * what a runtime enforces (CT-2075's posture-visibility finding, AH-CFC-14).
 * Three surfaces answered that question in three shapes — a toolshed route, a
 * console startup line, a run-state section — and three shapes are three
 * things to keep in agreement. This is the one shape, derived from the
 * constructed Runtime's RESOLVED fields: a second reading of configuration
 * could disagree with the first, and the disagreement would be invisible.
 *
 * Two things the record insists on that a bare dial dump does not. An
 * `observe` rung carries what it decides on, so `policyEvaluation: observe`
 * cannot be read as active enforcement — it is a diagnostic that decides on
 * the un-rewritten label. And every known sink appears, whether or not a
 * ceiling governs it: a list of the governed sinks reads as coverage, and a
 * sink missing from it is exactly the gap a reader needed to see.
 *
 * A third: the record says which of the two things it is. A surface that
 * publishes after its runtime exists reads the resolved fields; a surface that
 * publishes before — a console printing at startup, a harness recording a
 * session built lazily on first use — projects what those fields will be. The
 * two are not interchangeable. A projection is a claim about a path that has
 * not run, and an artifact asserting a posture the path did not honor is
 * exactly what an audit of these records exists to catch, so the record must
 * not be able to pass one off as the other. The three entry points below are
 * the only ways this code builds one, and each stamps its own provenance from
 * how it was called rather than from an argument. The third is a host that
 * runs on another host's runtime and republishes that host's record, which is
 * a third thing again: it neither read a runtime nor predicted one.
 *
 * What that buys and what it does not: no production path can mislabel a
 * record, and a reader of one built here can trust the stamp. It is NOT an
 * authenticated claim — the record is a plain serializable object, so a record
 * that arrived over a wire is only as trustworthy as the channel it came on.
 * `/api/meta` is read over the deployment's own transport and trusted on those
 * terms.
