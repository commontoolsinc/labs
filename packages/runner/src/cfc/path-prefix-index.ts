/**
 * An index over a set of paths for the one question `isPrefix` is asked
 * in bulk: is ANY path in the set a prefix of this one?
 *
 * A linear scan costs the set's size per query, and the set is a document's
 * dereference-trace sources — measured at 249 for one pane, consulted once per
 * read activity at commit preparation. A trie costs the query path's length
 * instead, which is small and does not grow with the set.
 *
 * The predicate is `isPrefix` below, which treats `"*"` as matching any segment
 * on EITHER side. The index implements that predicate, and
 * a test holds the two together across a generated corpus.
 *
 * Concrete queries follow one branch. Each node also buckets sources whose
 * first wildcard follows that node's concrete prefix; only buckets on the
 * query's branch need `isPrefix` checks. Cost depends on the query length and
 * those candidates, including all wildcard sources when they start with `"*"`.
 * A wildcard QUERY uses the scan: walking every child at its wildcard depth
 * measured 730x slower than scanning a 256-source set.
