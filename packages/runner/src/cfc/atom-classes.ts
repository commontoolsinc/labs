 * Integrity-atom propagation classes (spec §15 registry, §3.1.6.1):
 *
 * - `hereditary`: survives combination via the class-aware meet — an output
 *   carries it only when EVERY input carried it (weakest-link, the
 *   `PolicyCertified` family).
 * - `value-bound`: bound to a specific value identity; any transformation
 *   invalidates the binding, so it never propagates through the default
 *   transition.
 * - `provenance`: records how/where a value came to be (builtins, links,
 *   gestures, prompt slots); meaningful only for the value it was minted
 *   on, never propagated.
 *
 * Unknown atom types default to `value-bound` (SC-10): dropping on
 * combination under-claims integrity, which is the fail-safe direction.
