/**
 * Cross-space label-metadata representation (inv-12 Stage 1 / SC-25;
 * docs/specs/cfc-label-metadata-confidentiality.md §2/§5; spec §4.6.4.1).
 *
 * At the cross-space persist seam, every commitment-classified source-bearing
 * atom field (per `label-field-classification.ts`) is replaced by its
 * unsalted canonical digest, wrapped in the self-describing marker
 * `{digestOf: "<hash>"}` so consumers dispatch on SHAPE — transformed and
 * verbatim envelopes coexist without migration (a pre-Stage-1 envelope is
 * simply one whose fields are all plaintext).
 *
 * Reserved-key discipline (mirrors `clause.ts`'s `anyOf` and
 * `atom-pattern.ts`'s `var`): only a record whose SOLE own key is `digestOf`
 * with a string value is a commitment marker. A record carrying `digestOf`
 * in any other arrangement is malformed and stays an opaque value — it never
 * digest-matches anything and only equals its structural equal (fail-closed
 * in both directions: crafted atom data cannot impersonate a marker, and a
 * malformed marker cannot match plaintext).
 *
 * Digesting uses `hashStringOf` — the shipped canonical record digest
 * (`valueDigest` / `evidenceDigest` idiom; UTF-8-sorted keys, stable number
 * formatting) — so the same field value digests identically across runtimes
 * and re-derivations (SC-11 idempotence). Privacy honesty (spec §4.6.4.1):
 * commitments of low-entropy identifiers are PROBE-ABLE; this form hides
 * identities from observation, not targeted enumeration.
