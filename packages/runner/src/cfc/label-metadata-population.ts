// Template-population Stage B (docs/specs/cfc-template-population.md §5/§6;
// spec §4.6.4.2): the §4.6.4.2 field-precise label-metadata population
// profile, carried as multi-`*` labelMap entries under the
// `/cfc/labels/<target-envelope-path>/...` metadata subtree.
//
// For every persisted payload label entry that carries source-bearing fields,
// the persist seam mints (via {@link deriveLabelMetadataTemplateEntries}):
//
//   ["cfc","labels","value",...target,"confidentiality","clauses","*",
//    "alternatives","*"]            → whole-atom projection label
//   [...same, <field>]              → per-field observation label, one entry
//                                     per DISTINCT protected top-level field
//                                     name present in the entry's atoms
//
// Entry count is O(#source-bearing-field-kinds) per labeled path — the
// clause/alternative axes ride the `*` wildcards, so counts are independent
// of how many clauses or alternatives the label has (the same one-level-up
// entry-count wall §5 dissolves). Presence/`type`/`kind` and table-`public`
// fields mint NOTHING: absence of a metadata entry is PUBLIC under the
// §4.6.4.2 default profile, and public entries are never materialized.
//
// The labels minted are the SAME §4.6.4.2 interim population rule the
// introspection surface computes in hand (source-identity confidentiality
// when known — no carrier feeds that arm yet; else, for derived-containment
// entries only, the entry's own effective confidentiality; else fail closed —
// mint nothing, `inspectConfLabel` keeps those fields unobservable). The
// interim rule stays the label SOURCE; these entries are the CARRIER —
// upgrading precision later (true per-source labels) changes the labels
// minted into the same entries, not the mechanism.
//
// `origin`/`observes` decision (documented for the design's §3.3 rule —
// plain `IFCLabel` under `label`, no new entry fields):
//
// - `origin: "label-metadata"` — a DEDICATED origin, because the origin axis
//   is the update-discipline axis and these entries have a discipline no
//   existing origin has: they are a pure function of the payload entries in
//   the SAME envelope, re-derived at every persist of that envelope (so
//   replace-on-overwrite / cleared-with-the-entry-they-describe / SC-11
//   zero-write all hold by construction). Reusing `derived` would put them
//   through every derived/structure-keyed rule in the persist loop (the
//   freeze-carry, the SC-4 existence pool, writer-fit policy selection,
//   `isRuntimeMintedTemplate` machinery boundaries), each needing a carve-out;
//   a dedicated origin makes every existing origin-keyed rule ignore them by
//   construction.
// - `observes: "labelMetadata"` — the #4657 observation class, now allowed on
//   persisted entries: `readConsumesEntry`'s class table already gives the
//   needed consumption for free (no payload read class — value/shape/
//   enumerate/followRef — consumes it; the introspection surface is the only
//   consumer, resolving explicitly via
//   {@link resolveLabelMetadataTemplateConfidentiality}).
// - Canonicalization/coalescing need nothing new: both key on
//   (path, origin, observes), so templates coalesce only with themselves —
//   two payload entries at one path (the C2 value/shape split) coalesce-JOIN
//   their per-entry population labels into the per-path template, the
//   fail-toward-taint direction the per-path §4.6.4.1 addressing (clause
//   indices run across the concatenated per-entry clause lists) requires.
