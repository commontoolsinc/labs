// labelMap entries whose class matches. The write side (persisting entries
// with explicit `observes`) is stage C2 and must not ship before this reader
// is deployed — a class-unaware reader DROPS link-origin entries instead of
// treating them as covering, so writer-first would under-taint (C0 §9).

/**
 * How a read observed its path (the C0 §4 classification):
 * - `value`: recursive value read — materializes content, which also reveals
 *   presence/type and, for containers, membership.
 * - `shape`: `nonRecursive` read (key-add, length) — observes presence and
 *   cardinality, not element content. Count-shaped reads land here and
 *   consume `enumerate` (the spec's `count` class folds into it, C0 §4).
 * - `followRef`: a link-resolution probe / slot-pointer read without
 *   dereference — observes WHICH reference sits at the slot.
