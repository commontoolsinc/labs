// Why: the runnability backstop (`PiecesController.healDefaultRootByRollForward`)
// must distinguish the ONE CFC-rejection class it can safely recover from — an
// old document that cannot migrate onto a now-required field that carries no
// default (the estuary `favorites` case) — from every OTHER CFC rejection
// (policy, provenance, prepared-digest races), which must stay fail-closed.
// Repointing a healthy root's pattern identity in response to a transient
// ordering blip would be a correctness bug; see PR #4967's review.
//
// The discriminator is carried as a machine-stable TOKEN inside the prepare
// `reason` string, not as an error subclass, because only the message string
// survives the plain-`Error` re-wrap the runner applies at its setup-commit
// boundary (`runner.ts` — `throw new Error(error.message, { cause })`). Matching
// a token (not prose, not `instanceof`) is what keeps the producer (the CFC
// merge) and the cross-package consumer (the piece controller) in lockstep.
//
// This module is deliberately dependency-free so the browser-safe piece
// controller can import the token without pulling in the `cfc/mod.ts` barrel.
