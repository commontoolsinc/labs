/**
 * Cross-space label-metadata representation classes (inv-12 / SC-14 / SC-25;
 * docs/specs/cfc-label-metadata-confidentiality.md §2). At the cross-space
 * persist seam every source-bearing atom field is persisted in one of three
 * forms, per this table:
 *
 * - `public` — verbatim. For fields whose disclosure is the feature and for
 *   non-identifying fields.
 * - `commitment` — the field value is replaced by its unsalted canonical
 *   digest (the shipped `valueDigest` / `evidenceDigest` idiom). Preserves
 *   equality matching; loses dereference and variable-binding pattern
 *   matches. Honestly probe-able (an adversary can hash candidate DIDs and
 *   test).
 * - `reference` — the strong form: an opaque back-reference into the source
 *   space, resolved at evaluation time under the source's read authority;
 *   resolution failure collapses to `notAvailable` (Stage 3).
 *
 * Stage 0 ships the table as data only — the persist transform that consumes
 * it is Stage 1 (`cfcLabelMetadataProtection: off | observe | enforce`).
 * Fields not listed here are unclassified (`undefined`): the Stage 1 dial
 * decides the default posture for them; this module deliberately does not.
