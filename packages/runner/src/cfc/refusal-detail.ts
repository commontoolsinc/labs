// Why: a refusal that names only what it refused leaves the refused party with
// nothing to do about it.
//
// `sink-request confidentiality exceeds ceiling for fetchText: "medical"` is a
// complete statement of the verdict and a useless instruction. It says a
// confidentiality atom reached an egress that does not admit it; it does not
// say WHICH of the transaction's reads carried that atom in. An agent holding
// three inputs and one refusal cannot tell which input to drop, so it either
// drops all of them (losing the run) or retries unchanged (refused again).
//
// A refusal detail answers the second question. It names the boundary that
// refused, the atoms outside it, and the reads that carried each one — and it
// states, as a checkable property rather than a promise, whether those reads
// account for every offending atom. When they do, dropping them is a REMEDY:
// the same operation over the remaining inputs meets the ceiling. When they do
// not, the detail says so, and the caller learns that taint minimization alone
// will not clear this one.
//
// A clause is matched by `deepEqual`, the structural identity `uniqueCfcAtoms`
// and the ceiling-membership test already decide by. It has to be that one and
// not a rendering: `{a:1,b:2}` and `{b:2,a:1}` are ONE clause to CFC and two
// strings to `JSON.stringify`, so a rendered key would split a clause two
// reads carried, name only the first, and call the remedy complete — and
// dropping that read would leave the other read's identical clause behind,
// refused again. `-0` and `0` fail the other way: two clauses to CFC, one
// string, so a rendering would attribute an offending atom to an innocent
// read. Rendering stays what it is, a display form.
//
// The detail rides ALONGSIDE the reason string, never inside it. The reason is
// prose for a person and a matcher; encoding a structure into it would make
// every consumer a parser and every rewording a breaking change.
//
// Every type here is a `type` alias rather than an `interface` on purpose: a
// detail travels on the `cfc.prepare-reject` telemetry marker, and a marker
// crosses the runtime-client IPC boundary as a `FabricValue`. An interface
// carries no implicit index signature, so it does not satisfy
// `FabricPlainObject`, and the whole marker union stops being serializable.
