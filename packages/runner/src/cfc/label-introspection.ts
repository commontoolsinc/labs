// Inv-12 Stage 2 (SC-25/SC-6; docs/specs/cfc-label-metadata-confidentiality.md
// §3/§5; spec §4.6.4.1-.2): the bounded first-layer label-introspection
// evaluator behind the `inspectConfLabel` builtin, plus the §4.6.4.2
// population rule that labels each metadata observation it consumes.
//
// Scope discipline:
// - FIRST LAYER ONLY. A query addresses the confidentiality label stored at
//   one payload path (`/body` ↔ the `/value/body` envelope entry); the
//   labels-of-labels subtree (`/cfc/labels/...`) is runtime-enforced metadata
//   and is not introspectable (`parseConfLabelTargetPath` refuses `/cfc`).
// - EQUALITY PREDICATES ONLY, over the six §4.6.4.1 fields. An absent field
//   is no match (consulting absence is an atom-shape observation — public
//   under the default profile).
// - OUTCOME NORMALIZATION. Unobservable targets, missing metadata and
//   matching-but-unreadable atoms all collapse to one byte-identical
//   `{status:"notAvailable"}`; `ok` with empty atoms is returned only when
//   every per-atom field observation consulted to establish the miss was
//   observable (its population label exists), so the caller cannot
//   distinguish the hidden arms.
// - LABEL SOURCE (template-population Stage B). Protected field/projection
//   observation labels RESOLVE from the persisted `/cfc/labels/...`
//   population templates when the envelope carries them (the §4.6.4.2
//   field-precise profile, minted at the persist seam —
//   `label-metadata-population.ts`), falling back to the computed-in-hand
//   interim rule when absent (pre-Stage-B envelopes). On envelopes the
//   current runtime persisted the two agree exactly: the interim rule is the
//   label SOURCE, the templates its CARRIER.
// - CONSUMPTION. Every `ok` outcome reports the joined population-rule
//   confidentiality of the field observations it consumed
//   (`consumedConfidentiality`) plus the per-consulted-path records
//   (`consumedObservations`, at the CONCRETE clause/alternative metadata
//   paths); the transaction channel (`recordCfcLabelMetadataObservation`) is
//   wired by `inspectStoredConfLabel`, not the evaluator — the evaluator
//   stays pure over stored metadata.

/**
 * The full introspection step for one target, consuming on the transaction —
 * everything above the input plumbing the `inspectConfLabel` builtin owns:
 *
 * 1. Parse the payload pointer (a `/cfc/...` pointer — labels-of-labels — is
 *    refused: notAvailable).
 * 2. Read the resolved target's stored envelope through the SAME
 *    runtime-internal verifier seam prepare uses (`readStoredCfcMetadata`,
 *    INTERNAL_VERIFIER_META): the raw `["cfc"]` journal read stays excluded
 *    from flow/consumed derivations exactly as before (SC-6) — while still
 *    journaled, so reactivity re-runs the builtin when the envelope changes.
 *    A read ERROR is an unobservable target: notAvailable. Consumption
 *    happens through the explicit observation record below, never the raw
 *    read.
 * 3. Evaluate the §4.6.4.1 query (`evaluateConfLabelQuery`).
 * 4. The fail-closed dial rule (design §3 item 2; decision documented on the
 *    Stage 2 PR): a result whose evaluation consumed PROTECTED metadata
 *    observations is returned only when the transaction can carry the joined
 *    label onto the result — `cfcFlowLabels: "persist"` under a non-disabled
 *    enforcement mode, the one configuration where the derived component
 *    actually lands on the written result doc. Anywhere else the result
 *    would commit as an UNLABELED copy of protected label metadata, so it
 *    degrades to the same notAvailable as every hidden arm (indistinguishable
 *    by construction). Purely public results (empty consumed join) flow under
 *    every dial.
 * 5. Record the consumed observations (`recordCfcLabelMetadataObservation`),
 *    one per consulted CONCRETE metadata path (field consultations at the
 *    field segment, whole-atom projections at the alternative node — the
 *    evaluator's `consumedObservations`): they join the flow derivation
 *    (labeling the result through the normal per-tx J), the egress consumed
 *    set, the per-write input gate, and the prepared digest.
