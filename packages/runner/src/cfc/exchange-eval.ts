/**
 * The guarded-rewrite evaluator (spec §4.4.5, Epic B4 of
 * docs/history/plans/cfc-future-work-implementation.md §3): runs a policy snapshot's
 * exchange rules over one label to a fuelled fixpoint. The ONLY things a
 * firing may do:
 *
 * - ADD instantiated alternatives to the clause whose alternative the rule's
 *   `appliesTo` matched (spec §3.1.3 — exchange adds alternatives), or
 * - REMOVE the matched alternative for a `dropClause` rule (the spec's
 *   empty-instantiated-postcondition form; the clause disappears when its
 *   last alternative goes — the singleton case is the §4.2.3 Expires
 *   discharge).
 *
 * Clauses are never merged, created, or reordered; sibling clauses are
 * untouched (invariant 11 clause locality); integrity is never modified
 * (B2a rules carry no integrity postcondition). Evaluation is evaluation-
 * time only — rewritten labels are never persisted (design decision 1).
 *
 * Rule scoping (B2b, label-carried selection): `ambient` records are in
 * scope for every label (the B2a posture — operator-vetted standard
 * profiles; spec §4.4.1's deployment/system policy root), each rule still
 * gated by its own `appliesTo` + guards. `referenced` records are in scope
 * only where the CURRENT label carries a matching hash-bound
 * `Policy(...)`/`Context(...)` ref atom (§4.4.2/§4.4.3, fail-closed on
 * mismatch or absence), and their rules may rewrite ONLY the ref's home
 * clause(s) — the CT-1874 constraint; see `matchRule`. Records live in the
 * deployment snapshot in both modes: the owner decision (2026-07-10,
 * revising the earlier space-hosted-docs plan) is that remote attestation
 * covers deployment config for security-sensitive inputs like
 * `cfcPolicyRecords`, so attested federated peers provably evaluate the
 * same record set and space-hosted policy documents are not needed for
 * federation soundness (docs/specs/cfc-spec-changes.md SC-28).
 *
 * Termination (spec §4.4.5): add-only rule sets converge by monotonicity;
 * add+drop sets can cycle, so the evaluator is fuelled and FAILS CLOSED on
 * exhaustion — `exhausted: true` with the ORIGINAL label, never a partial
 * rewrite (invariant 6: violating a policy disables exchange, it never
 * silently downgrades).
