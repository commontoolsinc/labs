/**
 * CFC grant records (spec §8.12.7 route 2a; design
 * docs/specs/cfc-persisted-declassification.md §2): durable, revocable
 * release decisions persisted as content-addressed documents at a reserved
 * namespace, written only through the trusted policy-writer path
 * (`IExtendedStorageTransaction.writeCfcGrant`) and consumed at access time
 * by `policyState`-guarded exchange rules. The stored label of the released
 * value never changes — monotonicity is untouched; revocation is the grant's
 * lifecycle (mark revoked / expire); "disjunctions arise at access time"
 * stays true.
 *
 * ## Addressing decision (the design doc's one open point)
 *
 * A grant document's entity id derives deterministically from its RELEASE
 * SCOPE — `{ space, kind, owner, resource }` — hashed under a versioned
 * `cfcGrant` wrapper and carried under the reserved `grant:cfc:` id scheme
 * (the `cid:` schema-doc precedent: a distinct URI scheme IS the reserved
 * namespace, recognizable by the S18-class write gate without any registry):
 *
 *   id = `grant:cfc:` + hashStringOf({ cfcGrant:
 *          { version, space, kind, owner, resource } })
 *
 * Why these four fields and not the full record:
 *
 * - **Point-query-able (§4.9.3 discipline, never enumeration).** A consuming
 *   rule's guard binds `owner` from the label atom its `appliesTo` matched
 *   (a label-carried discovery) and names `kind`/`resource` concretely (or
 *   through already-bound variables), so the resolver can COMPUTE the one
 *   candidate address from `(kind + bound fields)` and point-read it. Fields
 *   that stay free in the guard — the audience being resolved — must
 *   therefore not participate in the address.
 * - **Revocable in place.** `audience`, `expiresAt` and `revoked` live in the
 *   document VALUE, not the address: revoking (or extending) a grant updates
 *   the same document, and consumers stop resolving it on the next
 *   evaluation. Hashing the full record would give a revocation a NEW
 *   address while the old address kept resolving the un-revoked content —
 *   exactly backwards.
 * - **One decision per scope.** Two grants by the same owner over the same
 *   resource under the same kind are the SAME durable decision (audience is
 *   the decision's current extent) — matching the §4.9.3 ACL precedent (one
 *   ACL doc per space whose value maps principals to capabilities; here: one
 *   grant doc per release scope whose value lists the audience).
 * - **Verified on read.** The stored value repeats the identity fields; the
 *   resolver recomputes the address from them and refuses a document that
 *   does not hash to the address it sits at (a forgery/corruption), before
 *   any lifecycle or audience check. Fail closed throughout.
 *
 * The GOVERNING SPACE is the owner's identity space (`space === owner`):
 * only the owner (and their runtime) holds write authority there, so a
 * verified document at the derived address carries the owner's release
 * authority implicitly — the same way the space ACL document is owner-gated
 * by living in the space it governs. Grants hosted in shared spaces (a team
 * space's policy root) need per-document write-attribution verification —
 * future work on its own track: the B2b space-hosted policy-doc plan this
 * was once coupled to is descoped (SC-28: attestation covers deployment
 * config; policy records stay in `RuntimeOptions.cfcPolicyRecords`), which
 * leaves grants as the one space-hosted policy state.

 * The consumption-receipt document id for a single-use grant (design §2.2;

 * ## Derivation decision
 *
 * Spec §6.5.1 derives an intent's consumption cell as
 * `refer({ intentConsumed: { intentOnceId } })`; the runner's shipped event
 * receipts derive theirs as `runtime.getCell(space, { resultFor: cause })` —
 * `createRef` over the cause record, minting an ordinary `of:` entity id.

 * { grantId } }`, one receipt per grant id) realized with the #4627 ADDRESS
 * IDIOM (the reserved `grant:cfc:` URI scheme + a versioned `hashStringOf`
 * wrapper, exactly like `cfcGrantDocId`) rather than `createRef`, because:
 *
 * - **The receipt is policy state and must live in the reserved namespace.**
 *   `noteSystemWrite` records ANY unprivileged write at ANY path under a
 *   `grant:cfc:` id as an S18-class violation. An `of:` receipt would sit
 *   outside that gate: forging one is merely fail-closed (a denied live
 *   grant), but unprivileged DELETION/overwrite of a spent receipt would
 *   RE-ARM a consumed single-use grant — fail open. The reserved scheme
 *   covers both directions with the gate that already exists.
 * - **Point-derivable from the grant id alone** (the §4.9.3 discipline): the
 *   resolver computes the one candidate receipt address from the grant it
 *   just verified — no enumeration, no cell machinery, readable under
 *   `internalVerifierRead` like every other policy lookup.
 * - **Same space as the grant**: the receipt is part of the grant's
 *   lifecycle state and rides the owner-space write authority the v1
 *   governing-space posture already establishes (module doc).
 *
 * Enforcement reads PRESENCE only: any document at this address — even a
 * malformed one — means the grant is consumed (a receipt cannot be forged
 * into absence; fail closed). The stored {@link CfcGrantConsumptionReceipt}
 * value is audit content, not the enforcement signal.

 *   "single use" advisory. So it resolves ONLY where resolution is
 *   atomically coupled to the receipt claim — the consuming boundary gates.
 *   (Consequence, stated for the observe dial: its diagnostics never show a
 *   would-be single-use release, because observe decides on the raw label
 *   and must not spend the grant.)
 * - **Receipts unavailable → unsatisfiable everywhere** (never silently
 *   multi-use): see `cfcGrantReceiptsAvailable`.
 * - **Receipt present → does not resolve** (guard unsatisfied, fail closed,
 *   exactly like revoked/expired). PRESENCE is the signal — malformed
 *   content still counts as consumed. The receipt's resolution-time state
 *   joins `consultedGrants` (present → content digest, absent →
 *   `CFC_GRANT_ABSENT_DIGEST`), so it binds into the prepared digest with
 *   the same invalidation discipline as the grant itself.
 * - **Own claim → resolves.** The registry remembers receipts THIS
 *   transaction claimed, so a re-prepare that finds its own staged receipt
 *   in the journal recognizes the same consumption instead of failing
 *   itself. If another release committed a receipt in between, this
 *   transaction's create-only mark still dies at commit (`receipt-exists`)
 *   — the race backstop makes the shortcut safe.
 *
 * Consumption attaches at RESOLUTION: the grant's facts entered the
 * decision basis of a consuming gate. Whether a specific rule firing then
 * used them — or changed the final decision — is not reconstructable at
 * staging time, and erring toward consumption is the fail-closed direction
 * (a spent grant releases nothing; an unspent-but-used grant would be a
 * replay). A resolved-but-rejected commit still consumes nothing: the
 * receipt rides the rejected transaction.

/**
 * The runner-side grant resolver for boundary evaluation sites that hold a
 * transaction (the sink egress gate and the input-requirement gate in
 * prepare.ts). All I/O lives here — the evaluator stays pure:
 *
 * - Candidate address: computed from `(kind + bound fields)` — `owner` (a
 *   bound DID) fixes the governing space (module doc), `resource` completes
 *   the release scope. A query with either unresolved returns nothing: the
 *   guard's variables must be bound from the label under evaluation (the
 *   §4.9.3 label-carried discovery), never enumerated. Rules that leave
 *   `resource` free (the §13.4.4 shape at a site that binds it from the
 *   evaluation context) arrive with the share-UI build-order item.
 * - Point read at the derived address, under `internalVerifierRead` metadata
 *   (the `readStoredCfcMetadata` idiom) so grant lookups never enter the
 *   consumed set or PC (design §2.3 soundness condition 2).
 * - Every consulted candidate — present or absent — is recorded with its
 *   content digest into the transaction's CFC state; B5-style digest binding
 *   (`PreparedDigestInput.consultedGrants`) invalidates a prepared decision
 *   whose grant inputs drift (design §2.3 soundness condition 3).
 * - Verification, then lifecycle: absent, malformed, address-mismatched,
 *   revoked, or expired grants resolve nothing (fail closed).
 * - Per-query memo: the transaction reads from a stable snapshot, so a
 *   fixpoint pass re-querying the same guard resolves identically; the memo
 *   keeps repeated evaluation cheap and the consulted-set recording
 *   once-per-candidate.
 *
 * The clock defaults to the runner's wall clock (`Date.now`, the builtin
 * idiom) — injected here, NEVER read inside the pure evaluator.
