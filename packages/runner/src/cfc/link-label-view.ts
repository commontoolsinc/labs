/**
 * The `cfcLabelView` side-channel that rides on a cell link's inner: the two
 * accessors for the view on a single link, and the walk that removes every
 * view from a whole inbound value.
 *
 * A view is display state rather than part of what a link addresses, and that
 * is what makes the two directions different rather than symmetric. Outbound,
 * the view may be shown but the caveat sources behind it may not, so the
 * conversion that mints a link for the main thread attaches the view's display
 * form to it, and no walk runs after the fact. Inbound, a view is an untrusted
 * artifact that must not become worker label state, so it is removed
 * outright.
