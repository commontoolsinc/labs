 * exchange-rule evaluation runs before the fit check, as at any boundary.
 * Confidentiality clauses that the ceiling does not satisfy AFTER exchange
 * evaluation MUST fail closed." So this module resolves the CONSUMED LABEL
 * of a rendered cell — it never rewrites the ceiling — and returns the
 * resolved confidentiality for the reconciler to fit (clause-subsumption,
 * §8.10.3) against the host's `maxConfidentiality`.
 *
 * Resolution runs RUNNER-side (this module) exactly as B5's sink gate does
 * (`evaluateGatedConfidentiality` in prepare.ts), differing only in the
 * boundary class: this mints `sinkClass:"display"` where the network sink
 * mints `sinkClass:"network"`. The reconciler consumes the resolved label; it
