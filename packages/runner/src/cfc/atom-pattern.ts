/**
 * Atom pattern matching for the exchange-rule calculus (spec §4.3.3/§4.4.5,
 * Epic B1 of docs/plans/cfc-future-work-implementation.md).
 *
 * An `AtomPattern` is one of:
 * - a **concrete scalar/array** — matches by structural equality;
 * - a **variable placeholder** `{ var: "$x" }` (a record whose SOLE own key
 *   is `var`, holding a non-empty string) — matches any value and binds it;
 * - a **record pattern** `{ type: …, field: pattern|value, … }` — matches a
 *   record atom that has every named field matching the corresponding
 *   sub-pattern (recursively). Fields the pattern does not name are
 *   UNCONSTRAINED (subset semantics): a pattern names exactly what it
 *   requires, so `{ type: HasRole, space: {var:"$s"} }` matches a full
 *   HasRole atom without spelling `principal`/`role`. The `type` field has
 *   no special role in matching — it is simply the field every registry atom
 *   carries, so patterns constrain it like any other field. A named field
 *   whose pattern value is explicitly `undefined` is an ABSENCE requirement
 *   (the atom must not have that field) — expressible from TS-authored
 *   policy records, unrepresentable in JSON, and fail-closed relative to
 *   ignoring the entry.
 *
 * Reserved-key discipline (mirrors `clause.ts`'s `anyOf`): `var` inside a
 * record is EITHER the exact placeholder shape or malformed. A record
 * containing a `var` own key in any other arrangement (extra keys, non-string
 * value, empty string) matches nothing — never silently degrading to literal
 * matching, in either direction (a pattern cannot literally match atom data
 * that happens to spell `{var: …}`, and a malformed placeholder cannot match
 * anything at all).
 *
 * Bindings are unification-style: the same variable name recurring anywhere
 * across one match (or across patterns in a conjunction) must bind
 * structurally equal values — this IS the post-match equality constraint
 * between variables (§4.3.3 `constraints`, plan B1 "constraint correlation").
