 *
 * A confidentiality label is a conjunction of clauses. Each clause is either
 * a bare atom (a singleton clause — every entry in today's flat labels) or an
 * authored/exchange-produced disjunction written as `{ anyOf: [atom, …] }`.
 * The `anyOf` wrapper is the wire discriminator, chosen so a clause-unaware
 * reader deep-equals the whole object against ceiling atoms, finds no match,
 * and treats the data as MORE restricted — never less (mixed-version
 * fail-closed by construction).
 *
 * The `anyOf` key is therefore reserved: an atom must never use it. To keep
 * accidental collisions fail-closed, only a record whose SOLE own key is
 * `anyOf` (with an array value) is recognized as a clause; any other shape
 * stays an opaque atom (unsatisfiable against ceilings — restrictive).

 * - a singleton `{anyOf: [a]}` unwraps to the bare atom `a` (semantically

 *   the wrong direction. Malformed nesting stays wrapped and opaque;
 * - an empty `{anyOf: []}` is kept as-is: it is an unsatisfiable clause
 *   (see `clauseSubsumes` for how both positions treat it fail-closed).
 *
 * Canonicalization never merges clauses, never unions alternative sets

/**
 * A `PersonalSpace(owner)` label alternative, restated as the one principal
 * every reading of the atom puts inside its audience: its owner.
 *
 * The atom is a SPACE principal, not a person. §15.2 and §4.1.2 both call it
 * a convenience form for a per-user space principal, and §4.9.4 generates its
 * reader fact by a §4.9.3 point query against that space's own ACL record,
 * calling it one of "the two `Space(...)` atoms". §3.6.4 does give a personal
 * space fixed membership, but only while it stays personal: its own sharing
 * bullet has adding a member CONVERT the space into a shared one, and §3.6.5
 * rewrites no labels when that happens. A `PersonalSpace(P)` clause stamped
 * beforehand therefore goes on naming a space that has stopped being
 * personal, which is what defeats reading its audience as one person.
 *
 * What holds regardless is the role hierarchy. §3.6.2 states `owner ⊃ writer
 * ⊃ reader` — "owners are implicitly writers; writers are implicitly readers"
 * — and §3.6.4 makes the named principal the space's sole owner, so the owner
 * is one of its readers by the role order rather than by any particular ACL
 * configuration. A ceiling whose audience is that owner is therefore inside
 * the label's audience however the membership has since changed, which is
 * what the fit test asks. This is a fact about space membership, not a
 * spelling equivalence, and it runs on the LABEL side only. In a ceiling the
 * same rewrite would claim a store declaring the atom is read by that person
 * ALONE — the reverse containment, which nothing establishes.
 *
 * Only the canonical two-field shape participates, and only when its `owner`
 * is a DID — the type §15.2 gives the field, tested with the identity
 * package's `isDID` rather than a `did:` prefix, so a truncated or
 * method-only string gets no reading — or the §4.6.4.1 `{digestOf}`
 * commitment the cross-space seam persists that field as. A record carrying
 * further fields, or an `owner` that is neither, is not the atom it resembles
 * and gets no reading either. `isDID` refuses a third colon, so a
 * method-specific id containing one is refused too; that is over-refusal,
 * which is the direction a well-formedness gate should fail in.
 *
 * Both fields are checked as OWN properties, which the sibling recognizers
 * here do not bother with because they only gate a comparison. This one
 * builds an atom out of the field it reads, so a value arriving from a
 * prototype would end up inside the manufactured `User`. Label atoms come
 * from `JSON.parse` and from module source, neither of which produces one,
 * so this is closing a shape the input cannot currently take rather than a
 * live hole.
 *
 * The well-formedness test reaches the plaintext form only. A commitment is a
 * digest of whatever the field held, and the transform that produces one
 * commits every classified field without inspecting it, so a malformed owner
 * digests exactly as a DID does and this predicate cannot tell them apart.
 * The committed form of a malformed owner is therefore admitted where its
 * plaintext twin is refused. What it can be admitted AGAINST is the bound:
 * the ceiling has to name that same malformed subject, in plaintext or under
 * the same digest, and §15.2 types `User.subject` as a DID too — so reaching
 * it takes a store whose declared policy is already malformed in the matching
 * way. Closing the gap properly means validating at the commit seam or
 * carrying the field's type into the marker, neither of which belongs in a
 * fit predicate.

/**
 * Clause subsumption — the ceiling-fit kernel (spec §8.10.3):
 * a ceiling clause `c` subsumes a label clause `l` when every alternative of
 * `c` appears among `l`'s alternatives (`alts(c) ⊆ alts(l)`) — then any
 * principal satisfying `c` satisfies `l`, so an observer admitted by the
 * ceiling clause is entitled to data guarded by the label clause.
 *
 * Deliberate fail-closed divergence from the pure set algebra: an EMPTY
 * ceiling clause never subsumes. Mathematically `∅ ⊆ alts(l)` holds and an
 * unsatisfiable destination-audience clause would admit any flow, but an
 * empty `anyOf` in an authored ceiling is far more likely malformed input
 * than a deliberate "nobody observes this" claim — so it contributes
 * nothing. (On the label side the algebra already fails closed: no
 * non-empty ceiling clause is a subset of an empty alternative set, so a
 * label containing `{anyOf: []}` never fits any ceiling.)
 *
 * Atom comparison is per-family entailment (`atomEntails`, Epic B1):
 * structural equality everywhere, plus the `Expires` timestamp order —
 * ceiling alternative `Expires(t_c)` entails label alternative `Expires(t_l)`
 * iff `t_c <= t_l` (every context the ceiling admits, `now <= t_c`, is one
 * the label allows). The clause generalization is per-alternative: `c ⟹ l`
 * for disjunctions iff EVERY alternative of `c` entails SOME alternative of
 * `l` — so the subset check becomes an entailment-witness check, reducing to
 * the previous deepEqual membership on order-free families.
 *
 * One case is added to that relation, on the LABEL side only: a
 * `PersonalSpace(owner)` alternative also answers a ceiling alternative
 * naming that owner, because the owner is always among their own space's
 * readers (`personalSpaceOwnerAsReader` above). Each comparison tries the
 * atoms as written first, so a clause carrying no such alternative costs
 * exactly what it did before.
 *
 * §8.12.1 states `atomLe` as structural equality plus the `Expires` order,
 * so this is a deviation from that text. It preserves the semantic criterion
 * the same section gives for the relation — satisfying the more restrictive
 * side implies satisfying the other — which is what makes it safe; the spec
 * edit it owes is recorded as SC-39.
 *
 * Clause IDENTITY is left untouched: `clausesEqual`, `normalizeClause`, and
 * `cfcCanonicalClauseDigest` still tell the two atoms apart, so a
 * mutually-subsuming pair can carry different digests. That direction is
 * fail-closed everywhere it shows — a §8.12.7 route-2b exemption naming one
 * does not exempt the other, and a ceiling meet keeps both alternatives
 * rather than collapsing them.
