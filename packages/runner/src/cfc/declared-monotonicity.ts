/**
 * The declared-component monotonicity gate (WP5; spec §8.12.1/§8.12.8;
 * docs/specs/cfc-persisted-declassification.md §4 item 3).
 *
 * A persisted path's DECLARED (store-policy) label component evolves only
 * through the schema-walk re-mint in `prepare.ts`. §8.12.1's
 * `canUpdateStoreLabel` — the semantics of record is the Lean mechanization
 * (`formal/Cfc/Store.lean`: `ConfLe`/`ClauseLe`/`IntegLe`) — requires every
 * update to be monotone:
 *
 * - **Confidentiality (CNF)** may only become more restrictive: every stored
 *   clause must still be present-or-strengthened in the proposal (the clause
 *   set may grow; an existing clause's alternative set may only shrink).
 *   The witness relation is `clauseSubsumes(proposed, stored)` — every
 *   alternative of the proposed clause entails some alternative of the
 *   stored clause (`alts(p) ⊆ alts(s)` modulo per-family entailment) —
 *   exactly the Lean `ClauseLe stored proposed`. `clauseSubsumes` fails
 *   closed on an empty proposed clause, so an unsatisfiable stored clause
 *   can never be re-witnessed: fail-closed, and seeded-metadata-only.
 * - **The declared integrity claim** may only remove atoms (weaker claims
 *   are safe; the store must not become more trusted "for free"): every
 *   proposed atom must already be in the stored set, by canonical structural
 *   equality.
 *
 * Scope (§8.12.8): the gate governs ONLY entries with `origin: "declared"`
 * on BOTH sides. Derived / link-carried / structure components follow
 * replace-on-overwrite disciplines, and legacy (origin-less) entries keep
 * the historical combined rules — none of them are ever compared here.
 *
 * A consequence worth stating plainly: schema mints that vary per write —
 * an `addIntegrity` current-principal claim resolving to a different acting
 * principal, a copied `exactCopyOf` label whose source changed — are
 * non-monotone declared updates by construction under `enforce`. That is
 * §8.12.1 semantics, not an accident: per-value evidence belongs in the
 * derived component, and the dial ships default-`off` while those mints
 * migrate.
 *
 * The one sanctioned exception (§8.12.7 route 2b — the future
 * declassification-event writer) is the per-transaction privileged
 * exemption: it names exactly one (doc, path, clauseDigest) triple, where
 * `clauseDigest` is `cfcCanonicalClauseDigest` of the STORED clause being
 * dropped or widened. Integrity violations are never exemptable.
 */

/**
 * Canonical clause digest — clause identity for the exemption seam and the
 * future §4 event record (`{doc, path, clauseDigest, …}`). Clause indices
 * are evaluation-ephemeral; the digest of the canonicalized clause (
 * alternatives deduped and hash-sorted, singleton unwrapped) is not.
