 * Resolution order (mirrors the server exactly):
 *  1. Implicit `OWNER` when `principal === space` (a principal owns its own
 *     identity space) or `principal` is a configured service DID — these hold
 *     regardless of ACL contents or deployment ACL mode.
 *  2. Otherwise the ACL document decides: `acl[principal] ?? acl["*"]`. A
 *     missing/malformed ACL, an unlisted principal with no `"*"` grant, or a
 *     capability short of READ all yield `null` (fail closed). The implicit
 *     owners above are unaffected by an absent ACL.
 *
 * `acl` is the space's ACL doc value (`undefined` = not yet read / absent):
 * both `undefined` and a malformed value fail closed. A returned role is
 * always reader-or-higher — every `Capability` is `isCapable(_, "READ")`, so
 * any explicit grant admits reader access; the exact rank is returned for
 * callers that need it, but the render mint only needs non-`null`.
