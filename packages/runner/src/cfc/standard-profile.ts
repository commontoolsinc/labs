/**
 * The §10.1 standard prompt-caveat profile, expressed entirely as ordinary
 * exchange rules (Epic B6 of docs/history/plans/cfc-future-work-implementation.md §3;
 * spec §10.1 / §8.10.5). There is NO prompt-specific runtime branch: the
 * runtime surfaces atoms (caveats in confidentiality, evidence in integrity,
 * `BoundaryContext` at release sites) and these rules decide discharge.
 *
 * Two DISTINCT rule sets, because bare-`InjectionSafe` discharge is only sound
 * where the evidence is known to be on the CURRENT value/path (§10.1):
 * - `MATERIAL_RISK_DISCHARGE_POLICY` — the material-risk drop rules, guarded by
 *   bare `InjectionSafe`. Consumed ONLY by the trusted-schema sanitizer
 *   (`schema-sanitization.ts`), which runs them over ONE instruction-inert
 *   path's confidentiality with THAT path's freshly-minted `InjectionSafe`, so
 *   the discharge is value-local by construction — replacing the old hardcoded
 *   `filterMaterialRiskAtoms` strip with a rule firing (goldens prove
 *   equivalence). This set is deliberately NOT in the deployment profile: at a
 *   boundary the integrity pool is the whole consumed label's join, so a bare
 *   `InjectionSafe` from one value would discharge a material-risk caveat on
 *   another (cubic P1 on #4567 — the tx-wide-aggregation cross-value hole).
 * - `STANDARD_PROMPT_CAVEAT_POLICY` — the tier upgrades, the value-screened
 *   discharge, and the display/influence discharge, all SOURCE-bound (and, for
 *   influence, SINK-bound) so they are safe against tx-wide integrity
 *   aggregation. Deployments spread this into `RuntimeOptions.cfcPolicyRecords`
 *   so it runs at real boundaries under `cfcPolicyEvaluation`. At a boundary a
 *   material-risk caveat is handled through the screening gradient
 *   (`CaveatScreened` evidence carries a `source`, so the tier rules correlate
 *   it to the caveat) → value-screened discharge — never by bare
 *   `InjectionSafe`.
