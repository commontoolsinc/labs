/**
 * Stage a sink request on `tx` and run `flush` once that transaction commits.
 *
 * The work happens after the commit because the request's own state — the
 * pending flag, the request hash a later run recognizes — has to be durable
 * before anything is sent. So the commit failing means the work never starts.
 * Usually that is right: the action runs again, stages the request again, and
 * a later attempt sends it. When the code that owns those attempts stops
 * making them, the caller is left with a request that was staged, never sent,
 * and never answered. `onRejected` is where a caller settles that. It is
 * called once, when the transaction is abandoned, and never on a rejection
 * another attempt still follows — the scheduler decides which is which, since
 * no rejection says so on its own.
 *
 * What it is handed says the request was refused and names the sink, and stops
 * there. A caller records that error where a pattern reads it, and the refusal
 * detail — the document the rule named, the confidentiality atoms that did not
 * fit, and with them the `source` of each caveat, the principal that introduced
 * it — is precisely what the pattern-facing surface withholds (inv-12 / audit
 * 28b, the rule `redactCaveatSourcesForDisplay` applies to label views). It
 * would be a strange bargain to refuse the write and then hand its reason to
 * the writer. The detail travels on `cause` and to the log below, both of which
 * face the operator. A deployment that wants a pattern to read some of the
 * reason declassifies the fields it chooses through an error exchange rule,
 * which names each field and the confidentiality it is released to.
 *
 * A rejected request has no receipt and no partial send. The refusal happens
 * before the transaction reaches storage, which clears the post-commit outbox,
 * so `flush` — and with it the release check below that would mint one — never
 * runs. `onRejected` reports what did not happen; it must not write anything
 * that stands for a completed request.
