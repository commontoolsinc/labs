/**
 * The schema-document registry: the strong, realm-lifetime index from a
 * schema document's tagged hash to its interned schema, backing `cid:`
 * `$ref` resolution (`docs/specs/content-addressed-schemas.md`).
 *
 * The registry is module-level rather than per-runtime because resolution
 * happens in pure schema code with no runtime handle, and because content
 * addressing makes realm-wide sharing safe: registration verifies every
 * document's content against its claimed hash, so an entry can only ever be
 * the one value its key names, whoever registered it.
 *
 * Retention is session-scoped through leases: every `StorageManager`
 * acquires one for its lifetime, and when the last lease in the realm
 * releases, the registry clears. Entries are therefore strong while any
 * session lives — a `cid:` ref in a link or selector must resolve for as
 * long as a session can read it, which the schema intern table's `WeakRef`s
 * cannot promise — and bounded by the distinct schema documents the live
 * sessions have seen, strictly less than the duplicated inline copies they
 * replace. Concurrent sessions share retention (the union of overlapping
 * lifetimes). A realm that never holds a lease — the memory server
 * registers through traversal without one — retains for the process
 * lifetime; its entries are a cache over its own store, so a future size
 * cap is safe there (an evicted document is one local read away).
