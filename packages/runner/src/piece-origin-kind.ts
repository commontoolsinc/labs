 * the runtime does with it cannot drift apart.

 * - `web`: an absolute HTTP or HTTPS program endpoint.
 * - `fabric-entity`: an unpinned fabric URL naming a mutable entity, whose

 * - `fabric-pattern`: content-addressed source, named directly or fixed by a
 *   trailing pin. It resolves to the same code forever.
