   * Clean up resources and cancel all operations.
   *
   * NOTE: This does not wait for in-flight transactions to settle.
   * Any unawaited tx.commit() calls will be canceled when
   * storageManager.close() tears down storage sessions. Callers
   * should await all pending commits before calling dispose().
   *
   * `closeStorage: false` leaves the storage manager OPEN for a caller that
   * OWNS it and is still using it — a second runtime sharing the same store, or
   * one that reads the store after this runtime is done writing to it. Every
   * other step still runs, which is the point: quiescing the WRITER is what
   * makes a subsequent read of the store a statement about a state this runtime
   * actually reached. `idle()` and `synced()` cannot substitute, because they
   * say nothing about the background work that only teardown stops —
   * `sourceReconciler`'s source checks and the runner's pointer-commit
   * roll-forwards both live outside the scheduler and can still commit. That
   * path also drains in-flight async builtin work first; see below.
   *
   * It is about OWNERSHIP, not survivability. `close()` destroys the manager's
   * providers and rotates its session id rather than latching it shut, so what
   * a later write does is a matter of circumstance rather than contract — all
   * measured: over a caller-held server, a write to a doc the replica never saw
   * lands, a retrying writer (`editWithRetry`) recovers, and a bare `commit()`
   * to a doc the replica already knew fails its stale-read precondition and
   * LOSES the write; over `StorageManager.emulate`, which owns its server,
   * closing strands everything. A callee cannot see which of those its caller
   * is in, so it hands the decision back rather than betting on the recovery.
   *
   * Passing `false` makes closing the CALLER's job — nothing else will. Note
   * `await using` / `[Symbol.asyncDispose]` always takes the closing path.
   *
   * Either way this resets the PROCESS-GLOBAL experimental config to defaults
   * (`resetModernCellRepConfig` and friends) — except
   * `readerSchemaPrecedence`, which dispose leaves standing: serving
   * runtimes are per-space and idle-disposed, so a teardown reset would
   * lift a live rollback from under the survivors. Under a non-default
   * flag that is visible to a second runtime still running against the
   * same store, which is exactly the caller this option serves — so set
   * the flags per process, not per runtime, if two of them must agree.

  /**
   * Creates a storage transaction that can be used to read / write data into
   * locally replicated memory spaces. Transaction allows reading from many
   * multiple spaces but writing only to one space.
   *
   * If the transaction fails with a RETRYABLE commit rejection, it will be
   * retried up to maxRetries times. Retryability is decided by the shared
   * rejection vocabulary (`isRetryableCommitRejection`, storage/rejection.ts),
   * which is an allow-list: a stale basis (server conflict or the local
   * inconsistency guard), a liveness failure the memory client heals on its own
   * (a transport failure, an undecodable frame), a discarded attempt
   * (`tx.abort()`, or a prepared CFC transaction whose inputs drifted before
   * the verdict), or an authorization denial the server itself marked
   * `retriable`. Every other rejection — an ACL/protocol refusal, an
   * authorization denial, a precondition failure, a commit-rule violation, a
   * CFC boundary refusal (`CfcCommitRefusalError`, a deterministic verdict on
   * the transaction's own reads and writes), a `SessionError` (nothing on this
   * path remounts the session, so
   * every attempt reuses the handle the server just refused) — is returned on
   * the FIRST attempt, because re-running cannot change the outcome and each
   * doomed attempt costs a round-trip plus a subscriber revert notification.
   *
   * Every retry invokes `fn` again with a fresh transaction. Aborting an
   * attempt discards only the operations staged in that transaction; an effect
   * `fn` commits through another channel survives and repeats on retry unless
   * the caller gives it a stable identity or otherwise makes it idempotent.
   *
   * A caller that decides inside the transaction whether to write at all — one
   * re-reading a precondition against the fresh state each retry sees — says so
   * through the value `fn` returns, which comes back as `ok`. An `ok` of
   * `false` carrying no `error` is the convention for a write that was declined
   * rather than one that failed. The bound on that convention is that we commit
   * whatever `fn` staged, whatever `fn` returned: declining does not abort the
   * transaction, so it stands for "nothing was written" only where the callback
   * stages nothing before it declines.
   *
   * @param fn - Function to execute with the transaction.
   * @param maxRetries - Maximum number of retries.
   * @returns `{ ok }` once the transaction commits, carrying whatever `fn`
   *   returned, or `{ error }` when it does not commit: a rejection that is not
   *   retryable, a retryable one whose retries are spent, or `fn` itself
   *   throwing, which aborts the transaction.

   *
   * Why this exists (the cfc-group-chat-demo `:133` stall —
   * verification-coverage.md OW45's PHASE-3 groupchat observation,
   * rootcause §2b): a blind UI-input write threads a SHAPE precondition at
   * its cell's PARENT (`setBlindStructuralTarget`). Under server execution
   * a serving wave routinely lands structure on the same document
   * concurrently with typing — the first `/cfc` labelMap stamp, a sibling
   * key add on the piece argument doc — and the engine then rejects the
   * input's commit as `stale confirmed read`: a ConflictError the ruled
   * vocabulary classifies RETRYABLE (storage/rejection.ts — catch-up, then
   * a fresh read converges). The previous call sites fired `tx.commit()`
   * and dropped the result, so the rejection's `readyToRetry` gate had no
   * consumer and the USER'S INPUT was silently, permanently lost — while
   * the served derivations over it (a send button's `disabled`) stayed
   * correctly stale forever.
   *
   * Semantics:
   * - `blind: true` is the LWW leaf-overwrite class (every renderer
   *   `$value` input write). The blind marking and the structural target
   *   are re-threaded PER ATTEMPT on the attempt's own fresh transaction,
   *   so a retry re-resolves the cell and bases its shape read on the
   *   caught-up state ("the retry's write carries its true version" —
   *   {@link awaitCommitRetryReadiness}).
   * - `blind: false` is the CAS class (`CellHandle.push`): the value was
   *   resolved by the caller (read-modify-write on the main thread) and
   *   the value-equality reads stay in place. A conflicted CAS write takes
   *   ONE attempt and surfaces the loss loudly — re-running `set` with the
   *   same already-resolved value against fresh state could erase an
   *   intervening writer's append (cubic/codex P1 on #6477); the modify
   *   step is not re-runnable here, so retrying is the caller's decision.
   *   CAS writes also never join a supersede lane: a blind set's retry
   *   must never write a push's resolved value or vice versa.
   * - `supersedeKey` makes writes to one UI control one LANE, and each
   *   attempt writes the lane's NEWEST requested value rather than the
   *   value this call was issued with. That closes both failure shapes at
   *   once: a delayed retry can never re-assert an older input over a
   *   newer one (the LWW-inversion hazard the OW47 report recorded
   *   against unguarded auto-retry), and a newer same-lane call that
   *   resolves VACUOUSLY — its `set` no-ops against the older write's
   *   still-standing optimistic layer, so it holds no ops of its own —
   *   cannot strand the value when that older layer is reverted: the
   *   older call's retry is still live and re-issues the newest value on
   *   the repaired base (the d05-diagnosed remainder of the :133 stall,
   *   where token-based decline left the value owned by a no-op).
   * - a write that exhausts the budget or is refused non-retryably resolves
   *   `{ error }` and is LOUD: `ui-cell-write.lost` is logged at error
   *   level and counted, so a run's census can see dropped user input (the
   *   silent-loss detectability lesson of OW46/S-D). Callers that must not
   *   block (cell IPC) fire-and-forget the returned promise; the loss
   *   report does not depend on them.
