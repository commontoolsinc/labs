/**
 * The schema-observing lazy view.
 *
 * Where `validateAndTransform` builds everything a schema selects in one pass,
 * a view resolves each path as the reader touches it, narrowing the schema by
 * that step. What the reader never asks for is never built, never link-resolved
 * and never registered as a reactive dependency.
 *
 * A view is reached only from a transaction marked with `markLazyMaterialize`;
 * `validateAndTransform` reads that mark and branches here after its own link
 * resolution, `asCell` dispatch and schema combination have run, so a view and
 * an eager read agree on which link and which schema they are looking at.
 *
 * ## What a view checks, and when
 *
 * At the container it is built over: the value's type against the schema's, and
 * the schema's `required` keys — that the value carries each of them, and that
 * the schema selects each one it requires. Both come off the container
 * read a view takes anyway, so neither descends.
 *
 * Everything below that is checked where the reader touches it. A subtree the
 * reader never reads is never validated — the deliberate cost of not
 * materializing what nobody wants.
 *
 * A mismatch the reader does touch surfaces at the nearest enclosing property,
 * which is where an eager read decides the same question. Under a `required`
 * property it becomes a {@link SchemaMismatchError}; under an optional one it
 * reads as `undefined`, because an eager read leaves a property whose traversal
 * fails out of the object rather than voiding it. Either way the read that
 * failed is registered first, so whatever depends on it runs again when the
 * missing data arrives.
 *
 * The root is the exception: a mismatch there yields `undefined`, which is what
 * an eager read yields for the same data, so the runner's existing
 * "argument did not resolve" gate handles it unchanged.
