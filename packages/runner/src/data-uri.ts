/**
 * Cell-side integration of the `data:` cell URI codec. The dividing line
 * between this module and `data-model`'s `codec-data-uri.ts` is the need
 * for the cell/link machinery: everything that can be expressed against
 * `data-model` alone lives in the codec (in that package); this module
 * holds the two operations that cannot -- {@link dataUriFromValueWithResolvedLinks},
 * which rewrites relative links against a base before encoding, and
 * {@link findAndInlineDataUriLinks}, which dissolves `data:` URI links
 * back into the values they carry.
 *
 * The payload encodes the cell's VALUE, and the codec's decode entry
 * points return that value. The document view that the address grammar
 * requires (`["value", ...]`-rooted and facet paths) is synthesized by the
 * one reader that thinks in documents -- `storage/transaction/
 * attestation.ts`'s `load()` -- which also guarantees that payload content
 * can never alias a document facet (`cfc`, `source`).
 *
 * The dependency on the link machinery is one-way: this module imports
 * from `link-utils.ts`, and `link-utils.ts` imports nothing back. The
 * relationship with `cell.ts` is mutual -- this module needs `isCell` (and
 * the `Cell` type) while `cell.ts` consumes it -- the same two-way shape
 * `cell.ts` and `link-utils.ts` had while these functions lived there,
 * relocated rather than newly introduced.

/**
 * Makes a `data:` URI that names a cell whose content is carried in the id
 * itself. Reading such a cell means decoding its own id; there is no document
 * in a space to fetch.
 *
 * The encoded payload is the cell's value itself; the document view that
 * the address grammar needs is synthesized on read (see the module doc).
 *
 * This is the encode half of the matched set this module exists to hold;
 * {@link valueFromDataUri} is what reads back what this writes. Both
 * sides speak only the standard `data-model` `FabricValue` encoding, which
 * carries that codec's prefix tag.
 *
 * Each primitive cell link within `data` is rewritten to a full sigil link,
 * with relative links resolved against `base`. That rewriting is what makes
 * the result self-contained: the ids it embeds don't depend on where it was
 * minted, so the URI denotes the same value wherever it later gets read.
 *
 * The standard encoding canonicalizes plain-object key order (UTF-8 byte
 * order, per `3-json-encoding.md` section 10), so two runtimes holding the
 * same value mint the same id regardless of key insertion history -- the
 * property that makes this content addressing actually address content.
 *
 * @param data The value to encode. Must be acyclic.
 * @param base Optional base link; relative links within `data` are resolved
 *   against it.
 * @returns A `data:` URI naming a cell whose content is `data`.
 * @throws If `data` contains a reference cycle.
