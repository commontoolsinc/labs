 * handler-not-run withdrawal and the piece-start deferral): when a
 * served event DEFERS — its durable entry left pending for a later
 * drain — every later-arrived durable served entry queued behind it in
 * the SAME SPACE defers with it, or a later arrival's consequence lands
 * ahead of an earlier one (the b01 register class, re-demonstrated on
 * the handler-not-run withdrawal as review-6459 F1: the drain queues a
 * pass's pending entries together, so a healthy follower dispatches —
 * and SEALS — right behind the deferred head). The exclusions mirror
 * the load-park arm's, deliberately: cross-space queue neighbours
 * (§2's order is per-space) and LT1 in-process copies (`served` with
 * no `streamEntry`) — a running event's same-wave cascade children,
 * not later arrivals. The enqueueSeq guard scopes the sweep to LATER
 * arrivals, which the facade arm gets implicitly (its failing event is
 * the un-dispatched queue head, so everything queued is later): these
 * arms run after the deferring event left the queue (dispatch) or off
 * the head slot (piece load), and an earlier event requeued by a
 * concurrent commit verdict must not be barred behind an event that
 * arrived after it. Sweeping is order-safe by construction — a swept
 * entry re-drains in arrival order on a later pass — so a spurious
 * sweep costs one deferral round, never disorder.

 * Decides what to do with an event-handler commit result.
 *
 *  - success: nothing more to do.
 *  - permanent: a commit-time precondition failure (receipt-exists,
 *    origin-committed). Re-running can never succeed and would double-handle the
 *    event, so it is never retried.
 *  - terminal: a deterministic refusal of the committed data on its own merits
 *    (`isTerminalRejection`) — the server's CFC row-label commit rule, or the
 *    client's CFC boundary refusing before storage; never retried —
 *    re-running recomputes the identical refused write, and the doomed re-runs'
 *    speculative rev bumps would starve concurrent siblings. Surfaced as a
 *    terminal outcome (telemetry `terminal: "rule"`) rather than a silent drop.
 *  - give-up (reason "non-retryable"): a non-permanent rejection that is neither
 *    a stale basis nor a terminal commit-rule refusal — an authorization denial,
 *    a malformed store operation, a transport error, a handler `tx.abort()`.
 *    Re-running against fresher confirmed state cannot resolve it, so the write
 *    drops fast rather than burning the retry window on a rejection that will
 *    recur identically.
 *  - give-up (reason "opt-out"): the caller sent with `retries: false` (a
 *    speculative lineage origin, an internal one-shot) and opted out of retrying.
 *    The failed write drops deterministically so a descendant of a failed origin
 *    does not run.
 *  - backoff / convergence-failed: a stale-basis rejection — a server-side
 *    ConflictError under contention, or the local StorageTransactionInconsistent
 *    guard (the same-replica race the rehydration storm produces). Re-running the
 *    handler against fresh confirmed state and committing again can succeed, so a
 *    committed write that represents user intent backs off with capped
 *    exponential delay and retries until it lands or the retry window elapses,
 *    after which it surfaces a terminal CommitConvergenceError rather than being
 *    silently dropped. This is the backpressure path.
 *
 * Only a stale basis is windowed, because only a stale basis converges by
 * re-running: the confirmed timeline moved on, and reading it fresh resolves the
 * commit. StorageTransactionInconsistent is windowed unconditionally — the
 * generalization of an earlier version that windowed it only when the commit
 * carried a mergeable op, which made the mergeable-op gate unnecessary. Every
 * other non-permanent rejection is deterministic with respect to confirmed
 * state: retrying it would waste the whole window arriving at the same refusal
 * (and, for an authorization denial, retry a security denial), so it fails fast
 * with the permanent precondition failures. There is no fixed retry count either
 * way — a stale basis is bounded by the retry window, and a non-stale-basis
 * rejection drops on the first attempt.
