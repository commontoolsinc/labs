// Wake shaping (timing side-channel mitigation, see
// docs/specs/sandboxing/TIMING_SIDE_CHANNELS.md). The moment a pattern observes
// a change is the last sub-second timing signal the runtime hands it, and it
// arrives on two paths: an *event* delivered to a handler through the
// scheduler's event queue (channel 3), and a *cell flip* propagating through
// the reactive graph — a renderer `$value` keystroke write or a server-pushed
// change — which never touches the event queue (channels 4 and 5). This module
// is the single shaping choke point for both (plan C): one token-bucket engine
// (WakeShaper), with a thin per-path adapter that fixes the semantics each path
// needs.
//
// The threat is a SUSTAINED high-frequency stream (held-key autorepeat,
// rhythmic tapping, a chatty background source) used as a reference oscillator
// to time other operations at sub-second resolution. The capability gate (W1)
// already denies a direct sub-second clock, so the job here is to floor the
// SUSTAINED cadence a pattern can observe while leaving ordinary interaction
// realtime:
//
//   - a per-group token bucket of BURST_CAPACITY tokens, one consumed per
//     delivery, refilling one per MAX_DELIVERY_DELAY_MS window. While tokens
//     remain, each wake is delivered realtime (the burst). Once the bucket
//     empties, further wakes queue and release as ONE batch per window — one
//     timing sample — and the bucket refills during quiet, so a later burst is
//     realtime again.
//   - the group key identifies the observing pattern instance (all of one
//     pattern's wakes of one class share a bucket — the property that defeats
//     the count-the-deliveries attack), namespaced per path: `event:` groups
//     for the event queue, `cell:` groups for cell flips (further split
//     interactive-vs-push by the caller; see shapableWakeGroupKey in
//     invalidation.ts).
//
// Per-path semantics, expressed per hold:
//   - Overflow policy: event holds pass no item key, so every event is kept in
//     arrival order (a counter still counts every click). Cell holds pass the
//     cell identity as the item key, so overflow coalesces last-wins per cell
//     (only the current value of a data cell is meaningful) without dropping
//     any distinct cell.
//   - Leading-edge delivery: event holds deliver synchronously (the deliver
//     thunk only enqueues to the scheduler — no re-entrancy). Cell holds defer
//     to a fresh macrotask, off the storage-notification loop's stack. The
//     trailing flush always runs inside the window tick, which is already a
//     fresh macrotask.
//   - Charge sharing: a cell hold carries the source commit as its charge key,
//     and every reader wake from that one commit rides a single burst token —
//     a token counts one user gesture, not the fan-out of readers it wakes
//     (all of them observe the same instant: one timing sample).
//
// IMPORTANT: only *shapable* wakes (real-world timing: renderer input, server
// pushes) may be routed here. Routing ordinary internal computation through it
// would delay reactivity and break the runtime. Deciding shapability is the
// caller's job (shouldShapeDelivery for events; shapableWakeGroupKey in
// invalidation.ts for cell flips).
//
// Games and other apps that need precise input timing are out of scope.
