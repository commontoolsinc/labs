// The serving scheduler's cooperative macrotask yield (server-execution v2
// stage C tuning, T3; serving-loop.md §2/§3).
//
// Why: the settle loop (`settle.ts`) runs every action of a pass on one
// microtask chain — no macrotask boundary from the first run to the
// last. On a serving runtime that is the wave's whole settle: the
// stage-C attribution
// measured chat event waves of 2.6–3.6 s in which the 100-ms flush
// deadline fired 2.5–8.3 s LATE (`wavesBudgetExhausted` was a symptom,
// not a bound), the lease-renew `setInterval` starved for up to 10 s
// against a 15-s TTL (t2: `wave-commit-rejected` then `lease-lost` on
// every active space within 10 ms — the process's renew timers missing
// together), and the memory server's 5-ms push flush waited too. The
// timers all ride the macrotask queue the loop never yields to.
//
// What: a time-sliced yield. `maybeYield()` is called between runs;
// when the current slice of continuous scheduler work has run longer
// than `sliceMs` it awaits one macrotask turn (`setTimeout(0)` — the one
// primitive that lets DUE timers fire in deadline order before it
// resumes; measured on Deno: a MessageChannel turn or `setImmediate`
// let 0–2 of 8 due timers fire across a 360-ms loop, `setTimeout(0)`
// all 8 within a few ms of their deadlines) and reports the slice to the
// installed observer FIRST, synchronously — the mid-wave lease renew
// rides that hook, so it never depends on the timer queue being
// serviced. Between yields nothing changes: the OFF arm and client
// runtimes never construct one of these (the scheduler creates it only
// under `runtime.servingPosture`), so their settle loops keep the exact
// microtask shape they had.
//
// Bound, stated honestly: the deadline becomes honest to within ONE
// action plus a slice — an action's per-demander instance runs (a
// 250-ms demand walk × its demanders) and its union-log resubscribe
// still run to their end; nothing here shortens the WORK (that is the
// design half of stage C, the per-demander walk). The yield is NOT
// placed inside the fan-out loop (see run.ts's note): a macrotask there
// let a run's own async seal refusal re-enter the pass.
