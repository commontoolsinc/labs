// Server-execution v2 fan-out stage B — the run supply's per-node state:
// the KNOWN-SCOPE RATCHET, the instance-set function over (ratchet ×
// demanders), and B7's PRECISE per-instance dirtiness. Owner ruling
// (2026-08-16): "if a space scoped calculation gets narrowed to user,
// it'll have to run for all users that demand it" — scopes.md §2's
// mechanism sentence: a principal's demand at a broad address is demand
// for THAT principal's instance of every node that narrows beneath it.
//
// The node stays SINGULAR (the spec-model's C11b): instances live in
// keys, basis rows, stamps — and, here, in one per-node record that
// remembers what running has DISCOVERED (never what a schema or a body
// declares — D11's no-static-analysis rule; the ratchet's only writers
// are run outcomes). Nothing here is reached off the serving posture:
// a node acquires this state only when the demand registry supplies
// demanders for it, and the OFF arm's `runSchedulerAction` never does.
//
// The RATCHET is ragged-capable (scopes.md §2 as amended 2026-08-16,
// the panel's Lens 1): the top hop — space→(user|session) — is
// structural, so it is one node-level bit (the broad slot's redirect is
// SHARED state; a node that narrows for one principal narrows for
// everyone). Below it, depth is PER PRINCIPAL: a node may be user-scoped
// for Alice and session-scoped for Bob (a data-dependent second hop),
// so the ratchet is a set of session-deep principals, never a single
// level. It only narrows — per principal — and is forgotten with the
// node (re-learned by the next probe run).
