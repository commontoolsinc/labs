/**
 * Backpressure policy for committed writes under contention.
 *
 * The runtime is optimistic: a committed write applies locally and is confirmed
 * by the server in the background. The server can reject a commit. Rejections
 * split two ways (see storage/rejection.ts):
 *
 *   - Transient: a stale basis-sequence conflict. Re-running the originating
 *     work against fresh confirmed state and committing again can succeed. Under
 *     sustained contention (for example a space rehydrating while a handler
 *     writes to it) these arrive in bursts.
 *   - Permanent: a commit-time precondition failure (receipt-exists,
 *     origin-committed). Re-running can never succeed and must not happen.
 *
 * A committed write that represents real user intent must converge or fail
 * loudly; it must never be silently dropped. This policy retries a transient
 * conflict with capped exponential backoff so the system slows down rather than
 * busy-looping, and keeps retrying for a bounded window long enough to outlast a
 * contention burst. If the window elapses without the write landing, the failure
 * surfaces as a terminal error rather than vanishing.
