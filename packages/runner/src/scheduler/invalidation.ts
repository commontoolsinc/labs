// Timing side-channel mitigation (plan B, channels 4/5). Return the token-bucket

// cell-notification shaper — i.e. the change is a shapable real-world-timing source

// pattern instance (carries a pieceId). Internal machinery (no pieceId) and
// ordinary local computation (not a shapable source) return undefined and are
// never deferred, so normal reactivity is untouched.
//
// Only interactive input (renderer `$value` keystrokes) is shaped here, under a
// per-pattern `|input` bucket.
//
// Server pushes (`pull`/`integrate`) are NOT shaped. The original reason —
// observation adoption needed the push's readers marked dirty synchronously —
// deleted with the adoption machinery (server-execution v2 Phase 1 stage C;
// runtime-mapping.md N62), so whether pushes should now be shaped is an open
// re-check (N10), not something this comment decides.
//
// The security cost of leaving them unshaped is small and was already the
// design's stated position: a pattern cannot drive server pushes at
// sub-second cadence (it has no way to make the server push faster than real
// network traffic arrives), which is the same network-bounded assumption the
// separate `|push` bucket already rested on. See the channel-5 row in
