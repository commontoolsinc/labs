/**
 * Which action a `scheduler/run/action` span belongs to.
 *
 * The key stays `scheduler/run/action` for every one of them, because a key
 * names a place in the code and the statistics are keyed by it — naming the
 * action there would multiply the rows by every action the runtime has ever
 * run. The timeline is where an occurrence can be identified, so this rides
 * along on the emitted measure instead, and only when emission is on.
 *
 * The module or pattern name is what a reader recognizes; the action id is the
 * fallback for an action that carries neither, and for one that carries an
 * empty string — which is a name a reader cannot use, not a name.
 *
 * Two property reads, and called only when a measure is actually being
 * emitted. Both halves of that matter and were measured: the full telemetry
 * builder formats every annotated read and write on its way to these same two
 * names, which costs about 675ns per action — more than twice the timing pair
 * it would sit inside — so a label asks for a name rather than for telemetry.
 * Deferring what remains costs about 4ns and saves about 19ns per action on the
 * ordinary path, where emission is off.
