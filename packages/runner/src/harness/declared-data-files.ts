/**
 * Attach the data files a program's own source declares.
 *
 * A pattern declares the code it depends on by importing it, and the resolver
 * follows that declaration. A pattern declares the data it depends on by
 * reading it, with `dataFile("./cities.json")`, and this follows that one.
 * Both are read out of the source, so a program carries the same files however
 * it was built and whoever built it, and no caller has to state a second time
 * what the source already says.
 *
 * A read resolves against the module that wrote it, as an import specifier
 * does, so the name a file is attached under here is the name the runtime will
 * look it up by.
 *
 * The names come from the resolved closure, and each is read back through the
 * resolver that produced it, so a program assembled from the file system, from
 * a web address, or from anywhere else reaches its data the way it reaches its
 * source.
 *
 * Parsing is the compiler stack's work, so the caller must have awaited
 * `ensureCompilerStack()` — `Engine.resolve` has, by the time it gets here.
 *
 * A declared name the resolver cannot produce is an error. The program cannot
 * be assembled as its source describes it, and saying so here names both the
 * module that asked and the name it asked for, while the pattern that would
 * otherwise fail at the read is still being built.
