/**
 * The patterns route: the server half of a `system:` pattern origin.
 *
 * A piece that records such an origin follows it by fetching a path under
 * {@link PATTERNS_ROUTE_PREFIX} from the host serving its space — the source
 * itself, or, with `?identity`, the content identity of that source's whole
 * authored import closure. This is what answers.
 *
 * Both halves of that exchange belong to the runner. The route prefix is part
 * of a pattern's content identity, because a compiled module is named by its
 * URL pathname; and the identity a request asks for is the value a worker
 * stores as `patternIdentity.identity` when it compiles the same source over
 * HTTP. A host serving this route has to reproduce both exactly, and an answer
 * that reproduces them imperfectly is one no runtime can adopt. So the route
 * is defined once here, and each host — the toolshed, a test harness hosting
 * storage in its own process — supplies its directories and composes the
 * answer with whatever else it serves.
 *
 * Deno-only: it reads files. Single-file reads only, never a directory
 * listing, so it behaves the same in a compiled binary's embedded file system
 * as it does on a source tree.
