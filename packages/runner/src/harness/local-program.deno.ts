 * listed here; the option is for a path the source cannot state, and for one
 * a caller wants attached to a program that does not read it.
 *
 * `root` grounds every authored name, and so decides the paths `dataFile()`
 * addresses a data file by. Omitted, it is the common directory containing the

 * that compiles local source goes through it. That is deliberate. Attaching
 * data files is a step a hand-rolled `resolve(new FileSystemProgramResolver())`
 * has no reason to remember, and a program assembled without them compiles and
 * type-checks perfectly — the omission only surfaces when a pattern reads one.
 * Composing the whole operation here removes the opportunity rather than
 * relying on each caller to take it.
 *
 * `deno task check-local-program` holds that line: it fails on a
 * `FileSystemProgramResolver` constructed outside this module.
 *
 * `resolve` is the harness's own `resolve`, passed in rather than imported so
 * this module carries no dependency on which engine compiles the result.
