 * The entry-module content identity of `main` within `files`, computed WITHOUT
 * compiling — the same value `Engine.compileToRecordGraph` stores as
 * `patternIdentity.identity` for a same-build compile of the same source
 * package. A program carrying extra source roots or data files must name
 * them in `options`: the compiler folds both into the entry's hash, so the
 * bare import-closure identity is not the stored one for such a program.
 *
 * `files` must include the entry's full internal import closure (a superset is
 * fine — unreachable files neither affect the entry's identity nor are they
 * validated). Ambient (non-rooted) `.d.ts` files are dropped as the engine
 * drops them; an authored, rooted declaration file is a module like any
 * other, and a data file is kept whatever its name says. `contents` must be
 * the **authored**
 * (pre-transform) source: the engine hashes pristine authored bytes, restoring
 * them via `pristineModuleSources` after the helper-injection pretransform, so
 * hashing the injected form here would diverge (see
 * `test/module-identity-engine.test.ts` "CT-1740").
 *
 * The caller must have `await ensureCompilerStack()`-ed first: import scanning
 * (via `resolveModuleImports`) parses with the TS parser.
 *
 * Throws if, walking the entry's reachable closure, any module still has an
 * internal-looking dependency (`./`, `../`, `/`) that did not resolve to an
 * included file — the closure is incomplete and the identity would be silently
 * wrong. Also throws on a `cf:` fabric import, which the light path does not
 * model (fabric mounts fold the imported pattern's identity into the leaf; use
 * the full compile path for those).
