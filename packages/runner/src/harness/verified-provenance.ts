 * An entry exists ONLY for a function object recorded through the single
 * runner-owned registration channel: post-evaluation module indexing
 * (`Engine.recordModuleProvenance`, gated by `isTrustedBuilderArtifact` and
 * the defining-module guard), which records the implementation function of an
 * exported / `__cfReg`-registered builder artifact with the module's content
 * identity and the artifact's export/`__cfReg` symbol. There is NO in-action
 * registration channel: a builder artifact minted DURING a running action has
 * no content-addressed identity, and the runner fails closed at creation time
 * instead of admitting it (identity E5 — see
 * `Runner.invokeJavaScriptImplementation` / `builder/action-context.ts`).
 *
 * The WeakMap itself is the anti-spoof proof for CFC: an attacker-supplied
 * function — even with byte-identical source text — was never registered
 * during a verified evaluation, so it has no entry. There is no string key to
 * collide and no load scoping required. This replaced the former
 * `implementationRef` × `verifiedLoadId` registry checks (deleted in PR E2);
 * see docs/specs/content-addressed-action-identity.md.
