// The space-root ensure core (OW45 arm-B server-ensure STAGE 1; design:
// docs/history/plans/server-execution-v2/optimize/
// ow45-armb-server-ensure-design.md, PR #6209, owner-green-lit 2026-08-23).
//
// Why this lives in the runner: the SpaceServer's activation owes the space
// a root ensure (existence + freshness), but `packages/piece` depends on
// `packages/runner`, so the executor cannot import `PiecesController`. The
// design's §1 implementation note picks the extraction over an injected
// hook precisely so the OFF arm stays ONE code path: the controller's
// creation arm delegates to `createSpaceRootIfAbsent` below (behavior
// preserved byte-for-byte — same phase labels, same causes, same
// transaction body), and the serving seat calls `ensureSpaceRootPattern`,
// which adds only what the server needs (ACL-derived home predicate,
// bookkeeping stamp + owner trust snapshot, the freshness reconcile).
//
// What deliberately does NOT live here:
// - the START of the root and its runnability repair pair (the cold-start
//   setup repair and `healDefaultRootByRollForward`) — client-side today,
//   stage 2's gate: the ON client's creation retirement must not ship
//   until the repair pair moves (design §2; this stage's report records
//   the gate);
// - the custom `defaultAppUrl` read — the opening user's home-config read
//   is client identity through and through, and the server-side
//   owner-scoped fetch is an UNRULED fork (design §3, open question 3):
//   the server ensure takes the sanctioned interim, system default only,
//   logged on the creation path;
// - `deriveSystemPatternSource` (packages/piece/src/system-pattern-url.ts)
//   — its home predicate is `space === runtime.userIdentityDID`, which is
//   CLIENT semantics: a serving runtime's `userIdentityDID` is the SERVICE
//   DID (see `Runtime.homeSpacePrincipalFor`), so the serving seat derives
//   home-ness from the ACL (self-owned = home) and passes it in.
