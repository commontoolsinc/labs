// The co-hosted reference implementation of the wave commit sink
// (server-execution v2 stage D, serving-loop.md §3d): commits wave batches
// directly against the space's engine, on the same process the memory
// server runs in. This is the store half of plane (a)'s loopback path —
// the wave's ONE derived commit, its basis rows, and its per-doc
// re-verification all inside one engine transaction (`applyWaveCommit`) —
// with stage B's derived-class lease admission enforced by the engine
// itself. Stage F's SpaceServer wires this sink under the serving loop;
// until then tests drive it.
//
// Stage D's three documented bounds are all discharged:
// - DISCHARGED (stage F): foreign provisioning batches now apply WITH
//   protocol.md §2's delegated-identity admission row — the batch's
//   `delegated` carriage (originating chain actor + capabilityRef) rides
//   the commit metadata, admission validates completeness, and scoped
//   foreign writes key from the CARRIED identity. A foreign batch with
//   scoped ops and NO delegated carriage is still refused (commitWave
//   below) — that path would silently key from the sink's own principal,
//   the empty-instance trap, cross-space edition.
// - DISCHARGED (stage F): the seal handoff carries read-only spaces'
//   read sets (ITransactionSealSink.sealSpaceReads), and the
//   accumulator's withdrawn-read closure folds them by doc identity.
// - DISCHARGED (stage G): sqlite ops in HOME wave batches attach their
//   cell-db file(s) through the `sqliteAttachmentsFor` hook (the memory
//   server's attachWaveCommitSqliteDbs — same validations and ≤1-db
//   rule as the transact path, keyed by the accumulator's per-RUN scope
//   keys), attached before and detached after the synchronous apply. A
//   sink constructed WITHOUT the hook still refuses such a batch
//   loudly. Sqlite ops in FOREIGN batches stay refused — Phase 5 KEPT
//   this refusal deliberately: no sanctioned producer folds sqlite into
//   provisioning, and the foreign attachment identity rides the
//   grant-scoped read design (protocol.md §2).
//
// Stage G also forwards the wave's durable outbound-append rows
// (serving-loop.md §5, FP1): `batch.outboxAppends` land INSIDE the same
// engine transaction as the wave commit, via applyWaveCommit.

   * engine dedupes commits by UNIQUE (session_id, local_seq), returning
   * the STORED result for a byte-identical replay and throwing "commit
   * replay mismatch" for a different one. Every sink in the process
   * shares ONE long-lived counter — `localSeqRef`, owned by the
   * ExecutorHost, starting at 0 — and uses the DR1 HOLDER identity
   * as the `sessionId`, which is simultaneously what the
   * derived-envelope admission requires (protocol.md §2, RULED
   * 2026-08-05: the producing session must BE the holder's own service
   * session). The counter is process-global rather than per-space
   * because the session is: a home sink's FOREIGN provisioning batches
   * (protocol.md §2b) land in other spaces' engines under this same
   * session, so per-space counters re-mint pairs another writer already
   * consumed there and the engine kills the later wave as a replay
   * mismatch (the ExecutorHost's `#sinkLocalSeq` doc carries the
   * incident shape). Freshness is structural, not queried: the holder's
   * process-instance component makes a new process a NEW engine
   * session, so 0 never collides; a park/re-activate within one
   * process reuses the counter. (A holder scheme WITHOUT a process
   * component would need a stored-max floor instead; no such scheme
   * exists.) Tests that construct throwaway
   * sinks may omit `localSeqRef` and get a private counter from 0 —
   * sound for a fresh session id per test engine.
