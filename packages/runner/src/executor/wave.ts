// The wave accumulator (server-execution v2 Phase 1 stage D,
// docs/specs/server-side-execution/serving-loop.md §3c–§3d): the seal
// destination a serving runtime's action transactions close into, and the
// wave commit step that batches what sealing attached.
//
// One abstraction, two destinations: `action(tx)` keeps its object and
// interface — 1 action run = 1 IExtendedStorageTransaction — and only the
// DESTINATION differs. On a client (the OFF arm always, and ON-arm
// speculation) seal == commit exactly as today. Server-side, under
// EXPERIMENTAL_SERVER_EXECUTION, the tx seals here instead: its writes
// apply to the space replica's optimistic overlay — the accumulator's
// layered view, store snapshot at the wave's input seq + previously
// sealed writes, which later action runs read through the ordinary read
// path — and the store commit is deferred to the wave.
//
// Sealing fires everything commit fires today: the per-action-run CFC
// gates run unchanged in ExtendedStorageTransaction.commit() before the
// destination dispatch (§3c — the unit is the RUN, `action × instance`,
// never the action), the reactivity log keeps feeding the scheduler's
// dependency graph from the tx journal, and the sealed commit's read set
// feeds the wave's per-doc CAS basis and the scheduler_basis rows (§3b).
// Identity annotations attach AT SEAL TIME, when the run still knows who
// it ran as; the wave commit step only batches what sealing attached — by
// then no single "current user" exists to consult, which is the model,
// not a gap (protocol.md §1).
//
// Nothing installs this on main: the serving loop that drives waves is
// Phase 1 stage F. The machinery lands dark, exercised by tests.

/**
 * What kind of run a contribution came from, deciding its writes' conflict
 * class at the wave commit's per-doc CAS (serving-loop.md §3d):
 *
 * - `derivation` writes are PURE — re-derivable, so a write whose doc head
 *   advanced past the wave's basis is DROPPED; the drop re-arms nothing —
 *   recomputation arrives only through the ordinary dependency path
 *   (serving-loop.md §3d, RULED 2026-08-05);
 * - `event-handler` writes are NON-RE-DERIVABLE consequences — rebased and
 *   retried on conflict, and REQUEUED (rolled back to unconsequenced,
 *   never lost) when the rebase conflicts semantically;
 * - `bookkeeping` is the SANCTIONED INTERNAL STAMP KIND stage F names
 *   when it installs the seal destination (serving-loop.md §3d, RULED
 *   2026-08-05: unstamped seals are refused, so the loop's own writes —
 *   the watermark-doc advance today; the acked-effect retirement write
 *   when Phase 4 lands the client-effect channel, protocol.md §5 —
 *   declare this kind; stage G's outbox-ROW retirement is an unstamped
 *   engine-table delete on plane (c), never a commit). Conflict class:
 *   non-re-derivable, so a raced bookkeeping PATCH rebases when it
 *   commutes with the concurrent commit (the loop's steady-state
 *   watermark advance is a key-path patch); a write that cannot rebase
 *   — a whole-doc set (the first-ever watermark write materializing
 *   the doc), or a semantic conflict such as a whole-doc authored
 *   intrusion — DROPS the contribution whole: there is no event to
 *   requeue, and no re-advance is scheduled by the drop itself. The
 *   loop's watermark advance is INPUT-driven, so the dropped doc write
 *   is re-landed only by the next input batch's advance — on a quiet
 *   space the doc simply lags (while the wave's commit metadata and
 *   the loop's in-memory W, decided before the drop, already carry the
 *   advance — see space-server.ts's bookkeeping-write comment).
 *   Watermark forgery is an accepted authored intrusion — protocol.md
 *   §1's threat model.
 *
 * The remaining §3d non-re-derivable members — `eventWatermark` advances
 * and effect intents — are produced by Phase 3 events and the stage-G
 * effect channel; they seal as `event-handler`-class contributions when
 * their producers exist.
