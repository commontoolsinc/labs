// The SpaceServer (server-execution v2 stage F, serving-loop.md §1, §3):
// one committing runtime per ACTIVE space. It owns the lease (renewed on
// a timer — stage B's cycle finally gets its cadence), the serving
// Runtime (flag ON, builtins registered, the pattern-update posture
// flipped server-side — §3e), the accepted-commit subscription (the
// host's in-process feed — plane (d)), and the wave loop: wake on
// accepted commit, run the affected graph to fixpoint through the
// stage-D wave machinery, commit ONE derived transaction per wave
// carrying the watermark (protocol.md §4).
//
// What activation LOADS (RULED 2026-08-02): there is NO piece-start
// policy. The space is one lazy reactive graph; activation loads graph
// structure sufficient to resolve the DEMANDED values (client
// subscriptions — the server's watch registry) and queued events — via
// `ensurePieceRunning`, the sanctioned prior art (the no-handler
// auto-load path), per demanded root, never "instantiate the pieces" as
// a step of its own. Undemanded derivations stay dirty-unmaterialized
// indefinitely.
//
// Phase-1 bounds, stated (the stage cut, plan Phase 1):
// - no events on the wire until Phase 3 (the event seam exists in the
//   wave machinery; this loop has no producers to drain), so
//   `events.*` counters stay 0 and the activation criterion
//   "undelivered events" has no instances yet;
// - demand at OFF-arm cardinality: per-run demanded identities plug in
//   at `#stampRun` (M1's seam); in Phase 1 the loop serves the graph
//   under its wave identity.
//
// Stage G lands the effect channel (serving-loop.md §4–§5): sealed
// post-commit effects defer to the per-space outbox and fire after the
// wave commit; effectful builtins' writebacks — marked with their
// effect key — commit as their OWN derived-class COMPLETION commits
// (never through the wave: §4's "never passes through §3d's sealing"),
// annotated from the outbox carriage captured at the original run's
// seal; the durable outbound-append rows deliver and retire through
// the outbox; `memo.*`/`outbox.*` counters are live.

   * the wave-level identity (the cardinality-1 fallback). The SUPPLY

   *
   * ATTRIBUTION (protocol.md §1; fan-out stage B, RULED 2026-08-16 —
   * design §F): a run's RESOLUTION identity and its ATTRIBUTION are two
   * things. The demand-supplied pair resolves the run's scoped

   * a real demanded instance). What the run ACTS AS is derived from the
   * scope it DISCOVERS by running — space → no actor; user → the user
   * (`firedAt.session = "server"` on its events); session → the pair —
   * settled at the seal from the transaction's read-scope ratchet
   * (wave.ts `settleScopeAttribution`) and, for a mid-run emission, at
   * the send site from the ratchet so far under the early-emit guard.
   * So a DERIVATION with a demanded identity is stamped
   * `attributionFromScope` and NO eager acting: a user-scoped instance
   * value belongs to all of the user's sessions and carries the user
   * only; a space node demanded by anyone carries none. HANDLER runs are
   * unchanged (the event's server-stamped `firedAt` is their explicit
   * actor — LD1; the in-process LT6 shape inherits the origin's pair).
   * Never DERIVED for `bookkeeping`: the loop's own writes are
   * service-identity writes that carry addressing and NO acting
   * principal (protocol.md §1's "The SpaceServer's own writes") — with
   * ONE explicit exception: a bookkeeping run carrying `info.delegated`
   * (OW31 seat S-A — the compile-cache / program materialization
