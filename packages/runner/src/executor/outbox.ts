// The SpaceServer's outbox (server-execution v2 stage G, serving-loop.md
// §4–§5): both halves of the effect channel.
//
// - The EFFECT half is PROCESS-LOCAL by design (§5; the FP1 ruling keeps
//   it that way): a queue of sealed post-commit effects — the network
//   work of `fetch*`, `generate*`, `sqlite*` — handed over by the wave
//   cycle AFTER the wave commit (never at seal: §3's "hand external
//   effects to the outbox (post-commit)"), deduped in flight per effect
//   key (`${kind}:${inputHash}@<result-cell id>` — the memo key basis
//   widened by the requesting node's target identity, see
//   effect-completion.ts `effectTargetKey`; §4's in-flight dedupe,
//   scoped per (key, target) because each effect's closure writes only
//   its OWN node's cells — the round-2 headline).
//   Crash-soundness needs no durability here: a crash re-misses the
//   effect from memo keys (§4, §6 step 3 — RULED, at-least-once
//   accepted). Per-entry run-context CARRIAGE (§4's miss rule: the
//   result-cell identity resolution + the acting identity + — carried
//   structurally — the label basis) is captured from the sealing
//   transaction's stamped context and consumed by the completion
//   committer (space-server.ts).
// - The DURABLE half (FP1, RULED 2026-08-03) is the engine-table rows
//   of cross-space event appends — written inside the emitting wave's
//   own transaction by the sink; this module DELIVERS them (an authored
//   delegated commit at the target — protocol.md §2, §2b; LT5's service
//   envelope) and deletes each row on delivery-ack. Activation calls
//   `deliverPendingAppends` to re-send undelivered rows (§6 step 5);
//   duplicates dedupe at the target's eventId horizon.
//
// FORBIDDEN and respected: no effect retry timers (failures commit
// error-shaped results; retries are input-driven — §4), no "pending
// effects" table (the effect half never touches the store), no delivery
// of a withdrawn contribution's appends (the wave folds survivors only).
