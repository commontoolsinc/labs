// The serving loop's counters (server-execution v2 stage F,
// serving-loop.md §7): exposed via the existing `/api/health/stats`
// shape as the `servingLoop` block. Implemented WITH the loop, not
// after — every phase gate in the plan reads these counters, and tests
// MUST assert on counters, not logs. The §3 amplification metric is
// computable from counters alone:
// `derivedCommits / (authoredSeen − effectAcks)`.
//
// Stage boundaries, stated so zeros read as design rather than gaps:
// `events.*` counts nothing until Phase 3 lands events-down, and
// `effectAcks` nothing until Phase 4's effect-channel acks exist.
// `memo.*` and `outbox.*` are LIVE since stage G: memo.hits counts
// builtin evaluations that resolved from the stored request hash
// (serving-loop.md §4's hit rule; reported for the fetch*, generate*
// and sqliteQuery families — fetchProgram and llmDialog count misses
// via the outbox but report no hit events yet). Each hit is one
// stored-key RESOLUTION per §4's hit rule — the stored result (or
// error-shaped result) IS the node's value and no effect fires: one
// avoided external call at that evaluation. The granularity caveat
// for Phase 2's gate arithmetic: hits count per EVALUATION, not per
// distinct request — one settled node re-evaluated N times counts N
// hits — so hit/miss ratios compare resolutions to admissions, never
// "N distinct requests suppressed". (In-flight dedupe of a live key
// is neither: attachment, not a hit.) memo.misses counts
// effects admitted to the outbox (every deferred post-commit effect —
// the serving posture's only producers today are the effectful
// builtins' requests), memo.inflight the live entries;
// outbox.queued/completed track admissions and settled effect work,
// and outbox.failed counts INFRASTRUCTURE failures (a flush throw, a
// rejected work promise, an LT4 deterministic append rejection) —
// effect-level failures commit error-shaped RESULTS per §4 and are
// memo-visible, not outbox failures.
