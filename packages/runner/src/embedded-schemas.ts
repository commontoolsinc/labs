/**
 * The embedded schemas: well-known schema bodies resolvable by URL from a
 * static in-process table on every peer, with no document behind them. The
 * renderer's vdom/vnode schemas are the residents.
 *
 * Each resident enters the table in external form, the way a member of a
 * content-addressed cyclic group is read: its refs into its own `$defs` take
 * the `<url>#/$defs/<name>` form, which the table answers as well, and no
 * entry carries a `$defs` of its own. A resolved embedded schema can then be
 * embedded below any other root — a narrowed schema places it under a
 * property — and its refs still name its own definitions, where a local
 * pointer would name the enclosing root's.
 *
 * Transitional (`docs/specs/content-addressed-schemas.md`): an embedded ref
 * is an allowed leaf inside content-addressed schema documents — every
 * realm resolves it identically without any closure entry — and the
 * expectation is that these refs retire in favor of ordinary `cid:`
 * documents, at which point this table goes with them. Stored documents
 * carrying the URLs keep resolving until then.
