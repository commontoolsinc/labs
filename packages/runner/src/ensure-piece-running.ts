 * therefore neither re-materializes metadata nor re-validates the stored
 * argument — a piece whose `patternSetupIdentity` names another version is not
 * repaired through this route, only through one that reaches setup. This keeps
 * the code simple and stateless.
 *
 * This function follows result metadata from argument or derived internal cells
 * back to the root result cell, then starts the piece if it's not already
 * running.
 *
 * The traversal logic:
 * 1. Start with the cell at the cellLink location
 * 2. Follow result metadata until it reaches the owning result cell
 * 3. Read the owning result cell's pattern metadata
 * 4. Start the existing owning result cell
 *

 * @param cellLink - The location that received an event or should be current
 * @param options - `propagateErrors` RETHROWS instead of collapsing every
 *   exception into `false` (review thread r3739139521): the serving loop's
 *   demand cycle must distinguish a creation-race DEFERRAL (`false` — retry
 *   next cycle) from an actual load/start FAILURE (throw — counted
 *   `structureLoadFailures`); with the collapse, its failure arm was
 *   unreachable and real errors retried silently every input-driven cycle.
 *   Default stays best-effort for the event-recovery caller.
