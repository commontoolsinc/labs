/**
 * First-party `RuntimeOptions` presets — the one place Runtime construction
 * config is assembled for our own environments (CT-1814).
 *
 * CT-1811 was a harness-vs-runtime divergence on the LOAD path, sealed by
 * `PatternManager.compileAndRegisterModules`. This module seals the second
 * axis: CONSTRUCTION-CONFIG drift. Before it, 13+ sites hand-rolled a subset
 * of `RuntimeOptions`, so a new option (or a changed constructor default)
 * could land unevenly and make the harness silently behave differently from
 * production. Observed instances: three parallel copies of the
 * env→`ExperimentalOptions` mapping whose parsers disagreed on non-canonical
 * values; the multi-user test worker not honoring `EXPERIMENTAL_*` while the
 * single-user runner did; client CLIs running patterns against the builder's
 * hardcoded-localhost `patternEnvironment` fallback.
 *
 * How the seal works — four gates, all in this file:
 *
 * 1. {@link RUNTIME_OPTION_KEYS} is a type-gated exhaustive registry of
 *    `keyof RuntimeOptions`. Adding an option to `RuntimeOptions` without
 *    registering it here is a COMPILE ERROR, which forces the author to
 *    decide, fleet-wide, how every environment treats the new option.
 * 2. {@link EXPERIMENTAL_ENV_VARS} is the canonical (and only) env mapping
 *    for `ExperimentalOptions`, type-gated the same way. A flag that is
 *    deliberately not env-reachable is declared `null` here instead of being
 *    silently absent from one wiring.
 * 3. {@link EXPERIMENTAL_FLAG_AUTHORITY} says, per flag, whether a client
 *    that is not built alongside its server follows the deployment or runs
 *    its own value — type-gated the same way, because a `cf` binary silently
 *    disagreeing with the server it talks to is the same drift one release
 *    further out. {@link experimentalOptionsForDeployedClient} is what such
 *    a client calls instead of {@link experimentalOptionsFromEnv}.
 * 4. Every preset composes the same {@link coreOptions}, so the invariant
 *    posture (today: the CFC dials) is written once. The conformance test
 *    (`runner/test/runtime-presets.test.ts`) pins each preset's full output
 *    as a golden, so any change to fleet posture is a visible diff there.
 *
 * Presets return a complete `RuntimeOptions`; call sites keep the
 * `new Runtime(...)` expression so construction stays greppable. Deliberate
 * per-environment deltas (mock fetch, error collectors, byte caches) are
 * explicit, documented parameters — a preset that hid them would be worse
 * than hand-rolled config. This is a convention, not a gate: a site CAN still
 * hand-roll `RuntimeOptions`, but first-party code should not.
 *
 * Classification of every option (the conformance test asserts this table):
 *
 * | Option                     | Treatment                                        |

 * | storageManager             | per-site (required param; open vs emulate, and   |
 * |                            | its identity/session, are the caller's domain)   |
 * | experimental               | per-site (required param — pass                  |
 * |                            | `experimentalOptionsFromEnv(...)`, host data, or |
 * |                            | an explicit `{}`; requiredness is the seal).     |
 * |                            | productionServer/remoteClient resolve an unset   |
 * |                            | `serverExecution` to the first-party default     |
 * |                            | constant; the single-process presets keep the    |
 * |                            | constructor default (OFF). A deployed CLIENT     |
 * |                            | passes what                                      |

 * either way, and a session that wants the floor's `observe` rung rather than
 * the bundle's `enforce` asks for it the same way.

 * Every network-fetch egress sink is public-only (an empty ceiling admits no
 * confidentiality atom), so labeled data cannot leave through them. The
 * llm-class sinks release ungated, carrying the reason, the owner, and the
 * condition that retires the gap ({@link SINK_UNGATED_RATIONALES} in the

 * ungoverned — any confidentiality, a secret as much as a risk caveat,
 * reaches them without a policy evaluation running. The posture record
 * publishes that as a deviation rather than leaving it to be inferred from a
 * sink's absence from a ceiling list. Building the mechanism that retires the
 * gap is planned in `docs/plans/cfc-llm-sink-admission.md`.
 *
 * Until the §8.12.5 route-2 widening, one path was gated anyway, by accident:
 * a pattern calling `llm(...)` staged its request in the transaction that also
 * wrote the builtin's own result store, that store declared nothing, and the
 * writer-fit misfit refused the commit. It fired on every such call, so under
 * this posture an llm call over caveated content did not work at all — the
 * opposite of what the rationale above says the sink is for. The store now
 * declares what flows into it, so the ungoverned statement holds of the
 * builtin path too. `max-enforcement-posture.test.ts` pins the hand-staged
 * request and `builtin-abandoned-request.test.ts` the builtin one; both flip
 * to asserting the refusal when the admission mechanism lands.
