/**
 * Read one path segment out of a data container WITHOUT falling through to the
 * container's prototype.
 *
 * A path segment names data. Plain indexing returns `Object.prototype`'s
 * member when the segment is absent and happens to be named after one —
 * `toString`, `valueOf`, `hasOwnProperty` and the rest are ordinary, legal
 * keys. That turned "absent" into a function: `getValueAtPath({}, ["toString"])`
 * handed back `Object.prototype.toString`, and `setValueAtPath({}, ["toString"],
 * v)` compared against it and threw "Cannot compare a function value".
 *
 * Arrays need no special case: an index or `length` is an own property, and a
 * hole is correctly absent — the same distinction the storage-v2 path helper
 * draws between record presence and sparse slots.
 *
 * Primitives need none either, and must not be excluded. `Object.hasOwn()`
 * coerces with `ToObject`, so it returns `true` for a string's `length` and its
 * indices — genuinely own — and `false` for `toUpperCase`/`toString`, which
 * live on `String.prototype`. Bailing out on everything non-`isObjectOrArray` would
 * lose `getValueAtPath("abc", ["length"])`, which callers rely on to
 * reconstruct write details over primitive subtrees; indexing unconditionally,
 * as this did before, would hand back the prototype methods. `Object.hasOwn`
 * is the line both want.
