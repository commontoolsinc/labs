/**
 * Returns true if the SHALLOW structure of `before` and `after` are the same.
 *
 * For non-recursive reads, only structural changes at the target level
 * (key additions/removals, type changes, link identity changes) should
 * trigger re-evaluation. Deep value changes inside existing keys should not.
 *
 * - Links: compared by identity (deepEqual), since a link IS the pointer.
 * - Plain objects: changed iff the key set changed (not the values).
 * - Arrays: changed iff the key set changed (not the values).
 * - Everything else: an opaque leaf, changed iff its value changed.
 *
 * Comparing by key set is only meaningful for a plain object or array, where
 * the key set IS the shallow structure and a subscriber on a deeper path still
 * catches a changed value underneath it. It says nothing useful about any
 * other object: a `FabricPrimitive` holds its state in private fields, so
 * comparing key sets reports every two of them as unchanged — and because that
 * state sits behind no enumerable key, no deeper subscriber path reaches it
 * either. The change goes unnoticed at every depth, which is what separates
 * this from a plain object's values being skipped by design. Those are leaves,
 * and a leaf is compared by value.
 *
 * That resolves an ambiguity this function used to leave open — whether a
 * shallow read of an opaque leaf should react to a change of class or to any
 * change of value. Treating non-plain values as leaves answers "any change of
 * value", which is also what the recursive path answers, so the same value
 * gets the same verdict whichever way it is read.
 *
 * A leaf whose comparison `valueEqual()` cannot perform will throw, and that
 * is deliberate: the classes it currently cannot compare are ones whose
 * protocol members are unimplemented stubs. A stub announcing itself loudly is
 * worth more than a quiet answer derived from it, and swallowing the failure
 * would let an unfinished class shape behavior here. Do not add a `catch`.
