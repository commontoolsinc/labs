/**
 * Builder-side replayability registry for `type: "ref"` builtin modules.
 *
 * At pattern-build time a builtin appears only as a string `implementation`
 * name — the runtime's module registrations (`builtins/index.ts`,
 * `registerBuiltins`) are invisible to the builder — so the computed-cell
 * classifier (`pattern.ts`, `assignComputedCellKinds`) decides replayability
 * by NAME, against this registry. Names fail STRICT: any name not listed in
 * `REPLAYABLE_BUILTIN_REFS` is treated as non-replayable and disqualifies
 * both the cells the node writes and the cell roots bound into its inputs
 * (non-replayable builtins may write through their inputs — e.g. `llmDialog`
 * pushes onto `inputs.key("messages")`).
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT derived from `isEffect` (scheduler semantics,
 * incomplete on the fetch family — do not complete or repurpose it) and NOT
 * merged with the scheduler-facing `EAGER_RESULT_BUILTIN_REFS` set
 * (runner.ts) — same shape, different concern.
 *
 * Reciprocal note lives at `builtins/index.ts` (`registerBuiltins`): when a
 * builtin is added there, record it here — either as replayable or in the
 * documented non-replayable list below.
 */

/**
 * Builtin refs whose execution is a pure, replayable derivation of their
 * inputs: re-running the node deterministically reproduces every write it
 * makes, so a dropped write to one of its output cells loses nothing. Only
 * these names may write computed-kind cells.
 *
 * Known NON-replayable builtins (async and/or externally effectful — must
 * never be added here): `fetchBinary`, `fetchText`, `fetchJson`,
 * `fetchJsonUnchecked`, `fetchProgram`, `streamData`, `llm`, `llmDialog`,
 * `compileAndRun`, `generateObject`, `generateText`, `navigateTo`, `wish`,
 * `sqliteQuery` (server round-trip; an effect like `llm`),
 * `inspectConfLabel` (reads stored label metadata — ambient CFC state that
 * changes independently of the node's inputs).
