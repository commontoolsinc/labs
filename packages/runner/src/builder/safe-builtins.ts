/**
 * The capability gate for the raw `Date`/`Math` intrinsics inside pattern
 * compartments (W6).
 *
 * `sandboxDateNow`/`sandboxRandom` back the gated `Date`/`Math.random` injected
 * into pattern compartments, so authored `new Date()` / `Date.now()` /
 * `Math.random()` become the safe API. They enforce the time/entropy capability
 * boundary by reading the lift-vs-handler context from the active frame: a
 * lift/computed (pure) context cannot read a clock or entropy at all (it would be
 * a fine reactive time source and would break idempotency), while a handler gets
 * pass-through entropy and a clock frozen to its triggering event.
 *
 * The handler clock is NOT the live wall clock. It is the event's own instant
 * (Frame.eventTime), captured once when the event was created and carried
 * forward to every event the handler emits, coarsened to one second here. Time
 * therefore does not advance during a handler's own work: reading it before and
 * after an `await` yields the same value, so a handler has no clock that ticks
 * during a synchronous secret-dependent operation and no fine wall-clock edge to
 * correlate a network round trip against. Across separate events it still
 * advances, bounded by how fast events arrive. `new Date(arg)` is deterministic
 * and is left untouched at the injection site. See
 * docs/specs/sandboxing/TIMING_SIDE_CHANNELS.md (W1/W6).
