/**
 * Both pattern construction paths that detect a reactive cell being captured
 * from an outer frame raise the SAME conceptual violation: a callback (a map /
 * filter / flatMap / computed body) closed over a `Cell`/`Reactive` that
 * belongs to a different frame, instead of receiving it as an explicit
 * reactive input.
 *
 * Historically the two sites threw two differently-worded errors, neither of
 * which named the offending site, the cell, or the consuming module — so
 * authors saw a bare SES stack and couldn't tell whether the two strings were
 * the same problem. This module produces one diagnostic shared by both sites,
 * enriched with whatever context is available at throw time.
 *
 * Note: the most common trigger — `(cell.get() ?? []).map(cb)` where `cb`
 * captures a sibling cell — is now lowered to `mapWithPattern` by the
 * transformer (CT-1626), so it no longer reaches here. This diagnostic is for
 * the residual shapes that genuinely cannot be auto-rewritten and need author
 * intervention.
