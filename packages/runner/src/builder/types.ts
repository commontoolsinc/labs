 *   assignable to the implementation's own generic column map, which it is not.
 * - `cfSqlite` gathers `table` with the row-label helpers, whose declarations

 *   the whole namespace is taken from the implementation, which is also what
 *   keeps its members agreeing with each other: a rule built from the helpers
 *   has to be one `table` accepts.
 * - `entityRefToString` and `valueEqual` come from `@commonfabric/data-model`
 *   and take fabric values as parameters, so the same reversal applies. The
 *   pattern-visible `FabricHash` and `FabricValue` are structural views of
 *   classes whose private fields no interface can carry, which is why no
 *   declaration can be assignable to them.
 * - `FabricKeyPair` is the one fabric class in the same position: its second

 *   to be assignable to the class. Its instance side is compared, both here and
