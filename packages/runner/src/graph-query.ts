/**
 * The driver a storage engine uses to resolve a schema graph query: given
 * documents the engine supplies, walk them under a schema and record every
 * document that schema reaches.
 *
 * A memory server resolves a subscriber's watch set with this, while a client
 * asks the same question of a live replica through `schema.ts`. Both run the
 * one traversal in `traverse.ts`, because a server and a client that disagree
 * about which documents a schema reaches leave the client waiting on a
 * document nobody will send. This module is the whole of what a storage engine
 * needs from the runtime to take part in that, and it re-exports the vocabulary
 * the two sides name in common so a caller reaches for one module rather than
 * the traversal's internals.
