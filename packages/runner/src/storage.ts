/**
 * Storage implementation.
 *
 * Life-cycle of a doc: (1) not known to storage – a doc might just be a
 *  temporary doc, e.g. holding input bindings or so (2) known to storage, but
 *  not yet loaded – we know about the doc, but don't have the data yet. (3)
 *  Once loaded, if there was data in storage, we overwrite the current value of
 *  the doc, and if there was no data in storage, we use the current value of
 *  the doc and write it to storage. (4) The doc is subscribed to updates from
 *  storage and docs, and each time the doc changes, the new value is written
 *  to storage, and vice versa.
 *
 * But reading and writing don't happen in one step: We follow all doc
 * references and make sure all docs are loaded before we start writing. This
 * is recursive, so if doc A references doc B, and doc B references doc C,
 * then doc C will also be loaded when we process doc A. We might receive
 * updates for docs (either locally or from storage), while we wait for the
 * docs to load, and this might introduce more dependencies, and we'll pick
 * those up as well. For now, we wait until we reach a stable point, i.e. no
 * loading docs pending, but we might instead want to eventually queue up
 * changes instead.
 *
 * Following references depends on the direction of the write: When writing from
 * a doc to storage, we turn doc references into ids. When writing from
 * storage to a doc, we turn ids into doc references.
 *
 * In the future we should be smarter about whether the local state or remote
 * state is more up to date. For now we assume that the remote state is always
 * more current. The idea is that the local state is optimistically executing
 * on possibly stale state, while if there is something in storage, another node
 * is probably already further ahead.
