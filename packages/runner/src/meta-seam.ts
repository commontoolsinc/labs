 * The seam is the runtime's, to read as well as to write, so none of this
 * reaches the cell surface a pattern compiles against. `pattern` links a
 * result cell to its pattern, and `argument` to its argument cell. `internal`
 * holds a manifest of links to derived internal cells. `schema` stores the
 * schema for a result cell. `patternSetupIdentity` records the pattern
 * identity whose complete setup state was installed on a result cell.
 * `result` lets a result cell link to its parent result cell, and lets the
 * argument and derived internal cells link back to the result cell.
 *
 * `cfc` is deliberately NOT a meta field: the `["cfc"]` document field holds
 * raw label metadata (Caveat.source and other principal identities), which
 * must not ride the raw meta seam. The cfc code reads the field directly
 * through its own verifier seams; display consumers get the redacted view via
 * getCfcLabel.
