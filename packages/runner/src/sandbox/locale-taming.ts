/**
 * Deterministic locale-method sanitization — a vetted pre-lockdown shim.
 *
 * SES `localeTaming: "safe"` amputates the `toLocale*` family: each method is
 * aliased to its non-locale equivalent and its arguments are silently ignored
 * (`toLocaleDateString("en-US", { month: "short" })` returns `toDateString()`
 * output). SES does this because the methods' DEFAULT arguments reach ambient
 * host state — an omitted `locales` resolves to the host locale and an omitted
 * `options.timeZone` to the host timezone — which is nondeterministic across
 * runtimes and a fingerprinting channel. But called with explicit arguments
 * these methods are pure functions of their inputs (modulo the engine's
 * ICU/CLDR tables), so amputation throws away a legitimately useful surface.
 *
 * We sanitize instead: each method that `localeTaming: "safe"` would alias is
 * replaced with a wrapper that pins every ambient default — an omitted locale
 * → "en-US", an omitted Date timeZone → "UTC", and the unsupported-tag
 * FALLBACK locale → "en-US" (see pinLocales) — and delegates to the original,
 * passing explicit arguments through otherwise untouched. Lockdown then runs
 * with `localeTaming: "unsafe"` so SES leaves the sanitized methods in place
 * and hardens them like any other intrinsic.
 *
 * Two consequences to be aware of:
 *
 * - This must run BEFORE `lockdown()` — the prototypes freeze at lockdown.
 *   `ensureSESInitialized` sequences it.
 * - It patches the realm's shared intrinsics, so host (non-pattern) code sees
 *   the sanitized methods too. That is strictly closer to native behavior
 *   than the status quo, where post-lockdown host code got the amputated
 *   aliases.
 *
 * Residual nondeterminism, accepted: ICU/CLDR version skew — identical
 * explicit inputs can format differently across engine versions (e.g. ICU
 * 72's switch to U+202F time separators). This is the same hazard class as
 * the untamed local-timezone Date getters (`getFullYear()` etc.), which
 * remain host-local.

// otherwise fall back to the host default locale, letting sandboxed code
// read the user's language/region off the formatted output. With the
// fallback appended, resolution picks the caller's tag when the host
// supports it and "en-US" when it doesn't — never the host default.
// Malformed tags still throw RangeError, unchanged.

  // would iterate, then the pinned fallback is appended so resolution can
  // never fall through to the host default locale. `Array.from` also turns a

// leak or a read-inconsistency hazard, and no legitimate caller needs it:
//
//   - primitives / functions: V8 coerces them to an object with no `timeZone`
//     (functions are objects; `ToObject` boxes primitives), so native formats
//     in the host zone. We reject rather than box.
//   - null: native throws `TypeError`; we reject consistently.
//   - a `timeZone` accessor (`{ get timeZone() {…} }`): a stateful getter can
//     return a real zone when we validate and `undefined` (→ host zone) on
//     native's read.
//   - an inherited `timeZone`: not a plain own property; treated the same as
//     an accessor for simplicity.
//
// Unlike locale resolution (which silently falls back — see pinLocales),
// ECMA-402 throws on an invalid *explicit* timeZone string, so a plain own
// value is safe to forward: `"Not/AZone"` / `null` still throw `RangeError`
// from native, and `undefined` (== omitted) is pinned to UTC.
