/**
 * Restoration of `Error.isError` — a vetted mid-lockdown shim.
 *
 * SES's error taming rebuilds the `Error` constructor from scratch rather than
 * patching the original, and copies forward only `length`, `prototype`, and
 * the V8 stack surface (`stackTraceLimit`, `prepareStackTrace`,
 * `captureStackTrace`). `Error.isError` is not among them, so lockdown leaves
 * the realm — host code included, not just compartments — without it. Every
 * `ses` release through 2.2.0 behaves this way; `permits.js` does list
 * `isError` under both `%InitialError%` and `%SharedError%`, but a permit only
 * says a property MAY survive, never that it gets added, so no version bump
 * fixes this on its own.
 *
 * The gap is silent until something calls it: `Error.isError(value)` throws
 * `TypeError: Error.isError is not a function`, and only in the post-lockdown
 * process. Code that classifies unknown values — data-model's
 * `tagFromNativeValue`, for one — reaches for it precisely because it is the
 * only correct error test across realms, `instanceof` being the thing it
 * exists to replace.
 *
 * We restore the genuine intrinsic rather than polyfill it. Captured at module
 * evaluation (before any lockdown), it is a pure predicate over the
 * `[[ErrorData]]` internal slot: no powers to withhold, no realm affinity, and
 * it answers correctly for the tamed constructors' instances because those are
 * still constructed from the original `Error`.
 *
 * Two consequences to be aware of:
 *
 * - This must run BETWEEN `repairIntrinsics()` and `hardenIntrinsics()`. The
 *   constructors do not exist before the repair phase and freeze during the
 *   harden phase, so the two-phase form of lockdown is the only seam where
 *   they are both present and extensible. `ensureSESInitialized` sequences it.
 * - There are two constructors to patch, not one. Repair mints `%InitialError%`
 *   for the host realm and a powerless `%SharedError%` for compartments;
 *   patching only the global would leave pattern code without it.
 */

 * and the default carries it in. Defining the property as `undefined` instead
 * would fail SES's `isError: fn` permit, so the harden pass would strip it
 * right back out and report an unpermitted intrinsic on every lockdown.
