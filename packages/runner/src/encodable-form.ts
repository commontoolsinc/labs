 * property and a `FabricPlainObject` has none, so an artifact has to be
 * replaced before the value crosses into the data model. An artifact sits
 * wherever a pattern author put it -- under a tool's `handler` key, in a
 * result, inside a node's `inputs` -- so finding one takes a walk.
 *
 * The `toEncodableForm` name is what bounds the subject to _builder artifacts_.
 * An artifact carries `toJSON` as well, delegating to the same serializer (see
 * `builder/json-member.ts`), but that name belongs to `JSON.stringify` and the
 * conversion gives it no standing: a plain object carrying a `toJSON` it
 * defined itself is user data, and the conversion rejects it, that `toJSON`
 * being a function-valued member.
 *
 * An artifact is reached in two shapes and both are covered: a module is an
 * object, and a factory is a _function_ carrying its module's members (the
 * `Object.assign` in `builder/module.ts`). A function is replaced but never
 * descended into: its members are the builder's, not content.
 *
 * Subtrees carrying no artifact come back by identity, which keeps an already
 * deep-frozen `FabricValue` eligible for the conversion's identity fast path
 * and keeps a twice-reachable object shared.
 *
 * A cycle is left for the conversion to reject. What it rejects it _by_ may be
