/**
 * Following a piece's source origin.
 *
 * {@link SourceReconciler.reconcile} runs when a piece is opened: it reads the
 * origin the piece records, resolves it, and adopts the source it names when
 * that source has moved. Nothing reconciles a piece nobody opened, and no kind
 * of piece — a space root included — has a path of its own.
 *
 * A user opening a piece is what opens most of them. The runtime also opens the
 * surfaces it instantiates for itself, and {@link SourceReconciler.open} is how:
 * it supplies the origin such a piece is made from, so that piece records where
 * its code came from and is followed from then on like any other.
 *
 * Whether a candidate has to prove itself first turns on one question: did
 * anything gate the release that produced it? A `system:` origin names source
 * this deployment serves, released through golden replays that load
 * representative state written by the previous version and check the new one
 * still reads it (`docs/specs/pattern-update-testing.md`). That check is
 * better than any the runtime could make, and repeating a weaker version of it
 * would only refuse releases the replays already cleared. Every other origin is
 * somebody else's, and nobody promised anything, so a candidate from one has to
 * prove itself — today by not moving the piece's contract at all, which
 * {@link SourceReconciler.reconcile}'s refusal check explains.
 *
 * `docs/specs/piece-source-lifecycle.md` is the design of record.
 * `piece-origin-kind.ts` enumerates the origins this dispatches on.
 *
 * What each reconciliation concluded is recorded on the piece it ran for, so
 * that a reader who opens it later can tell one that is following its origin
 * from one that could not reach it and one that refused what it offered. See
 * "Saying when a piece has stopped following its origin" in the lifecycle spec.
