/**
 * Write the ending of a request whose staging transaction was abandoned.
 *
 * A builtin stages its request in the transaction that schedules the work and
 * does the work once that transaction commits, so an abandoned one means the
 * request will never be sent and nothing else will say so. `write` puts that on
 * the builtin's own result cells — the pending flag down, the refusal as the
 * error — and announces those cells again, because the announcement rode the
 * abandoned transaction and a reader has nothing to look at without it.
 *
 * One transaction for both, attributed to the builtin and carrying the served
 * effect's completion key: a writeback naming neither is refused under the
 * serving posture, which would leave the pattern pointing at nothing — the
 * state this exists to prevent. Every request staged on the outbox has such a
 * key, so it is required rather than defaulted.
