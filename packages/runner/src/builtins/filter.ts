/**
 * Implementation of built-in filter module. Like map, this is called once at
 * setup and manages its own actions for the scheduler.
 *
 * Runs a predicate pattern per element. The output array contains cell
 * references to the original input elements where the predicate is truthy.
 * Output is always dense (no holes), even when the input is sparse.
 *
 * Identity tracking and reconciliation are identical to map — see map.ts for
 * the full explanation of how getAsNormalizedFullLink() provides stable
 * identity for cell links and positional identity for inline values.
 *
 * Two-pass convergence: when a new element appears, its predicate pattern
 * hasn't run yet, so the predicate cell is undefined and the element is
 * excluded. The predicate then runs, updating its cell, which re-triggers
 * this action. On the second pass the element is correctly included or
 * excluded.
