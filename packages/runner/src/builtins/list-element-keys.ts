 * It is a release rather than a stop, so an element result that something
 * opened in its own right keeps running; `docs/specs/runner-child-run-ownership.md`
 * defines the two authorities. A reconcile whose transaction does not become
 * durable has released children for a removal that never landed. The next
 * reconcile reads a list that still holds those elements and sets them up
 * again, on the same deterministic result cells, so their values return.
 *
 * An entry is dropped only once its child is released, so a release that
 * throws leaves the entry for the retry and for the coordinator's teardown to
 * find. Every other child is released either way, and the failures are raised
 * together at the end: one child whose cleanup throws must not keep its
 * siblings running. Passing an empty set releases every child, which is what
 * teardown and an input that went undefined both want.
