/**
 * Name `store` as a store the runtime owns for `owner`'s piece: a document a
 * builtin mints from its own node's cause to hold state, rather than data an
 * author named.
 *
 * A builtin's state store holds whatever the transactions running that builtin
 * read, and an author cannot know which atoms a given transaction will carry,
 * so no confidentiality declaration written into a schema covers it. CFC's
 * write-side fit check (spec §8.12.4) reads this marker and declares that
 * policy itself; `docs/specs/cfc-enforcement-matrix.md` §4 states the route.
 * The runner records the same marker for a piece's own argument, result and
 * internal documents.
 *
 * Only a store keyed on this NODE belongs here. A document the runtime mints
 * from a constant or from the space's own principal — a space cell, a shared
 * clock, a per-space pinned-cell list — is shared by every piece in the space,
 * so one piece's flow join has no business becoming its declared policy.
 *
 * The marker names the store for THIS transaction, which is what a store the
 * runtime mints and fills in one go needs — a dialog message, say. A store the
 * node keeps across transactions wants {@link ownedCell}, which enrolls it as
 * well.
 *
 * The marker carries the runtime's authorization, which is what the fit check
 * asks for: the method that records it is reachable from anything holding a
 * cell, so an unmarked marker naming the same document counts for nothing.

 *
 * This is the shape every builtin holding its own state uses, so the mint, the
 * marker and the scoping stay together: a builtin that mints a store without
 * naming it has a store whose every labeled write is refused, and the refusal
 * arrives at whichever later transaction first carries a label rather than at
 * the mint.
 *
 * The enrollment is what reaches those later transactions — a node's state is
 * written by event handlers and by settled requests, each on a transaction of
 * its own. It lasts until `owner`'s piece is cancelled, which is why only a
 * store the node KEEPS belongs here: one minted per event would grow the
 * enrollment for as long as the piece runs, and needs the marker alone.
