 * `piece`, `space`, `task`, `inputs`, `resultSchema`, `maxConfidentiality`,
 * `tools`, `submittedAt`, `state`, and `stateSince`. A runner writes
 * everything from `claim` on as an authored client — `claim`, `attempts`,
 * the terminal fields — and moves `state` and `stateSince` as it goes. The
 * builtin never writes the record again; it reads it, which is what lets a
 * derived creation and later authored writes share one document.
 *
 * `cancelRequestedAt` is the one field a client other than the runner
 * writes: the `cancel` stream of `agent-run.tsx` sets it, and a runner that
 * sees it on a record it is running aborts the run and ends the record
 * `cancelled`. A stream event reaches only the runtime that runs the handler,
 * so the durable field is what carries a cancel to a runner in another
