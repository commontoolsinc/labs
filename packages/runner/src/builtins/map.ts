/**
 * Implementation of built-in map module. Unlike regular modules, this will be
 * called once at setup and thus sets up its own actions for the scheduler.
 *
 * This supports both legacy map calls and closure-transformed map calls:
 * - Legacy mode (params === undefined): Passes { element, index, array } to pattern
 * - Closure mode (params !== undefined): Passes { element, index, array, params } to pattern
 *
 * The goal is to keep the output array current without recomputing too much.
 *
 * Elements are tracked by the normalized link address of their cell (via
 * `getAsNormalizedFullLink()`). The `asSchema` traverse with
 * `asCell: ["cell"]` already resolves cell links to target entities, so:
 *
 * - Cell links: `list[i]` resolves to a cell pointing at the target entity.
 *   Its normalized link is stable across position changes, enabling reuse.
 * - Inline values: `list[i]` resolves to a cell pointing at the array position.
 *   Its normalized link includes the positional index, so identity = position.
 *   Shifted inline values get new runs (acceptable trade-off).
 *
 * @param list - A doc containing an array of values to map over.
 * @param op - A pattern to apply to each value.
 * @param params - Optional object containing captured variables from outer scope (closure mode).
 * @returns A doc containing the mapped values.
