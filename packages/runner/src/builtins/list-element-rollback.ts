/**
 * Undo a reconcile's in-memory bookkeeping when its transaction does not become
 * durable.
 *
 * A reconcile records an element's result cell and index in plain memory while
 * writing that element's setup through its transaction. The memory survives a
 * transaction that is rejected or aborted, so the next reconcile finds the entry,
 * reuses it, and never re-runs the setup whose writes are gone. The element then
 * has no pattern and reads as undefined for as long as the coordinator lives.
 *
 * A stale basis is the exception. A conflict or a local inconsistency re-runs
 * the same reconcile against fresh state, and that re-run is what converges;
 * it reuses this bookkeeping and re-issues only the writes it still needs.
 * Tearing the bookkeeping down under it makes each attempt rebuild the elements
 * it just discarded, and the reconcile stops converging altogether. Every other
 * outcome — an abort, a terminal or permanent refusal, a transport failure —
 * has no such re-run behind it, so the record has to go.
 *
 * The setup writes themselves are what the re-run has to re-issue, and every
 * failed outcome loses them, stale basis included. Marking the record as
 * needing setup again is therefore the one undo that applies to all of them: an
 * element whose entry survives is set up again by the next reconcile, rather
 * than reading as undefined for as long as the coordinator lives. The result
 * container's own links are setup writes of the same kind — the coordinator
 * keeps the container in memory, so a reconcile that loses those links leaves
 * a container nothing points at — and they are marked and re-issued the same
 * way.
 *
 * Each undo checks that the state it is about to revert is still the state this
 * reconcile installed. An overlapping reconcile that has already moved the same
 * entry owns it, and its bookkeeping matches durable writes of its own.
