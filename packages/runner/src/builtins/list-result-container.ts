/**
 * Issue the writes that make a list coordinator's result container reachable:
 * the container's `result` and `pattern` meta, and the link the coordinator
 * hands to its output binding.
 *
 * A coordinator mints a container and then keeps it in memory across reconciles,
 * so these writes are setup in the same sense an element's pattern run is: the
 * reconcile that stages them and does not commit loses them while the
 * coordinator carries on holding the container. A container nothing links to
 * reads as undefined for as long as the coordinator lives, so the record passed
 * here says whether they are owed, and the next reconcile issues them again
 * against the container already in hand. See list-element-rollback.ts for the
 * undo contract.
