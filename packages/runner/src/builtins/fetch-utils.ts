/**
 * How long a claimed request mutex is believed before another replica may take
 * it over.
 *
 * This is not a bound on the request. A request issued here ends when its
 * promise settles or its AbortSignal fires, and `fetch.ts` decides from its own
 * state, not from the clock, whether it already has one in flight. The only
 * reader is a replica that finds a claim it did not make and has to decide
 * whether the replica that made it is still there. Nothing in the runner
 * reports another replica's presence, so that question has no event to wait on
 * and a staleness bound is the only answer available.
 *
 * The value is left where it was. Once an early takeover no longer costs a
 * result, the size is a trade with a cost on both sides: too low sends a second
 * copy of the request to the remote peer whenever another replica looks in
 * while one is running, too high leaves a replica that arrives before the bound
 * elapses looking at a claim it will not take over and has no reason to
 * re-examine, so the piece keeps showing a spinner. A duplicate request is
 * wasted work; a spinner that never resolves is a dead end, so the trade goes
 * to the lower value. A caller whose endpoint is slow enough that duplicates
 * matter raises its own bound with `options.mutexTimeoutMs`.
 *
 * `docs/features/fetch-request-deadlines.md` records why this bound stays
 * and what an early takeover costs.

 *
 * Two normalizations are applied before hashing:
 *
 * (1) The top-level `result` property and `options.mutexTimeoutMs` property
 *     are dropped. `result` exists only as a TypeScript type hint at call
 *     sites, and `mutexTimeoutMs` is a local scheduling knob. Neither is a
 *     real fetch parameter, so neither must influence the hash.
 *
 * (2) `undefined`-valued object properties are dropped, recursively.
 *     Callers commonly materialize snapshots via unconditional object
 *     construction (e.g. `{ url, mode, options }`, or one level deeper
 *     `{ method, body }`), and the resulting hash needs to be the same
 *     regardless of whether an absent field is omitted entirely or
 *     present-but-`undefined`. The `FabricValue` layer preserves
 *     `undefined`-valued properties, so this function must do the
 *     JSON-style normalization itself.
 *
 * `hashStringOf()` itself is happy to hash `undefined` values; no
 * normalization for hashability per se is needed.
