/**
 * Normalizes a selector's schema for the wire

 * `contentAddressedSchemas` flag, shared with the link writer — the two
 * emissions deploy together). Two obligations meet here:
 *
 * - PREFERENCE (flag-gated): a schema whose whole closure
 *   `isSchemaDocPersisted` confirms in the target space emits as a
 *   reference — server-confirmed local presence implies server presence,
 *   since a confirmed document arrived by delivery or an acknowledged
 *   commit and can never change.
 *
 * - CORRECTNESS (unconditional): a schema that already carries `cid:`
 *   refs — a live pattern's binding schema, a schema minted in another
 *   space — must NOT reach the wire unless the target space persists the
 *   closure, because the server answers an unpersisted selector reference
 *   loudly. When the closure is not confirmed there, the schema
 *   recomposes to the fully inline form through the realm registry, which
 *   holds every document behind a locally created reference.
 *
 * A decomposition refusal keeps the selector exactly as given when the
 * schema carries no references — inline is inline, and the server accepts
 * it. Refusal is structural as often as it is a missing document, so a
 * ref-bearing refusal splits on what the SERVER can answer: a schema
 * whose every reference the target space is confirmed to persist passes
 * through as given, and any other throws
 * {@link SelectorClosureUnavailableError} — a document held only in the
 * local registry backs nothing on the wire, the structural refusal rules
 * out recomposing inline, and emitting would violate the client's
 * send-only-what-you-can-back obligation while spending a round trip on
 * the server's refusal. The retainer invariant is one instance: a
 * reference dies with the registry epoch that minted it, and every
 * retainer of externalized forms drops them on the registry clear (the
 * wish sidecar pattern caches, the sanitize memo), so a cross-epoch
 * reference reaches this gate with nothing confirmed anywhere — a bug to
 * surface at its source, not to forward.
