 * when the catch-up write lands as a fresh notification, but that does not cover
 * a conflict whose triggering write was already delivered, so the re-queue is
 * what guarantees re-evaluation.) The reactive path recovers the local
 * stale-basis guard (`isStorageTransactionInconsistent`) the same way — it too
 * converges by re-running, so it re-queues off the budget rather than stranding
 * a compute as a zombie under a contention burst. Only a non-permanent error
 * that re-queueing cannot resolve — a transport or malformed-store error —
 * keeps the bounded retry. (Not to be read as "a transport error can never
 * converge": `editWithRetry` treats it as liveness and DOES retry it, for the

 * because re-queueing a reactive compute is not the same act as re-running a
 * transaction — see the note on the two classifiers in

 *
 * The event-handler commit path treats the same rejection as the signal to
 * apply committed-write backpressure: re-running the handler against fresh
 * confirmed state and committing again can succeed, so a conflict is retried
 * with backoff rather than dropped. It windows the local stale-basis guard
 * (`isStorageTransactionInconsistent`) the same way. Every other non-permanent
 * rejection there — a handler-initiated abort, an authorization denial, a
 * transport or malformed-store error — is not a stale basis and cannot converge
 * by re-running, so it drops fast rather than entering the window (see

/**
 * The STALE-READ sub-family of {@link isConflictRejection}: the server

 * with that meaning, and this predicate matches exactly those two:
 *
 * - `stale confirmed read: <id> at seq N conflicted with seq M`
 *   (validateConfirmedReads — a confirmed read's document advanced);
 * - `stale pending read: <id> via localSeq N conflicted with seq M`
 *   (resolvePendingReads — a read through the session's own accepted
 *   layers whose underlying document advanced; the sibling shape of the
 *   same race, reachable when the serving side's commit advances a
 *   pending-read target while the confirmed reads pass).
 *
 * The engine's OTHER `ConflictError` messages are deliberately NOT
 * matched, because neither describes a basis a fresh read repairs:
 *
 * - `pending dependency not resolved: <localSeq>` — this session's own
 *   earlier commit is unresolved; that commit's fate decides, not a read.
 * - `entity-value-hash precondition target changed: <id>` — a commit
 *   PRECONDITION (the create-only / value-hash class) failed on the
 *   committed data's own merits; re-running double-handles.
 *
 * Beyond the engine, `ConflictError`s are also CLIENT-FABRICATED
 * (storage/v2.ts `makeLocalRejection`) with verbatim caller messages —
 * wave withdrawals wrap inner errors ("seal failed: …", "wave abandoned:
 * …"), which can EMBED a staleness phrase without being one. The match is
 * therefore anchored to the MESSAGE HEAD: an embedded phrase never
 * classifies. One same-family client shape is knowingly NOT matched:
 * `commit preempted: read set stale until caughtUpLocalSeq>=N`, minted
 * only under the experimental `CF_CONFLICT_ADMISSION=preempt` mode
 * (default off) — extending to it is that mode's own decision, recorded
 * here rather than taken silently.
 *
 * Discriminated by MESSAGE, the way `toRejectedError` (storage/v2.ts)
 * already recovers the conflicted entity from one: `Error` fields do not
 * survive the wire, the message does, and its format is owned by the
 * `ConflictError` construction in memory/v2/engine.ts.
 *
 * A caller that only needs "can re-running converge at all" wants
 * {@link isRetryableCommitRejection}. This predicate is for a caller that
 * must separate a basis a fresh read fixes from every other refusal — the
 * commit-gated piece start, whose first-hydration commit races the serving
 * side materializing the very documents its basis read as absent
 * (server-execution v2; verification-coverage.md OW45 arm B). Introduced

/**
 * A liveness failure: the commit never reached a verdict because the link to
 * the memory server was down. The committed data was never evaluated, so
 * nothing about it is refused — a fresh attempt over a re-established
 * connection can land the identical write, and the memory client re-establishes
 * one WITHOUT being asked: a transport close schedules `reconnect()`, and a
 * `transact` issued while disconnected queues in `#outstandingCommits` and calls
 * `client.restoreConnection()` (memory/v2/client.ts). `ConnectionError` is the
 * runner's normalization of a transport failure (storage/v2.ts
 * `toConnectionError`).
 *
 * `InvalidMessageError` is the other liveness class, and the less obvious one.
 * The client raises it when a frame off the wire will not decode
 * (memory/v2/client.ts `onMessage`), and then calls `rejectPending(error)` —
 * which rejects EVERY in-flight request with it, not just the request whose
 * response was malformed. An in-flight `transact` is collateral: the server may
 * never have seen it, may have committed it, may have replied successfully in a
 * frame that was garbled after the fact. What is certain is that nothing about
 * the commit was evaluated and refused, so it is a liveness failure and not a
 * verdict. Unlike a `SessionError` the connection is typically still usable —
 * one frame failed to decode, the socket did not close — so the next attempt is
 * a fresh request that may well be answered. That is a reason to allow the
 * retry, not a guarantee it lands: if frames keep arriving undecodable the
 * budget is spent and the caller sees the real name.
 * (For it to be classified at all the name must survive normalization —
 * `toRejectedError` in storage/v2.ts preserves it explicitly for that reason.)
 *
 * This is deliberately narrow. An `AuthorizationError` is NOT a liveness
 * failure even though it also arrives from the network: the server evaluated
 * the request and denied it. The one exception the server marks itself —
 * `retriable: true` on a session-open anti-replay race
 * (memory/v2/session-open-auth.ts) — is handled by
 * {@link isRetryableCommitRejection} reading that marker, not by class.
 *
 * `SessionError` is NOT here, and the reason is the retry path rather than the
 * error: it is the same "never evaluated" shape as a `ConnectionError`, but the
 * re-established session its convergence argument needs never arrives. Nothing
 * between two `editWithRetry` attempts clears or remounts one:
 *  - `SpaceReplica.#memoizedSessionHandle()` (storage/v2.ts) memoizes the mount and drops
 *    it only in `close()`/`closeNow()` — and, since 2026-08-26, when an admitted
 *    commit touches the space's ACL doc (`consumeOwedSessionRemount`, the READ
 *    path's fix for the profile-starvation fifth face). Nothing an `editWithRetry`
 *    ATTEMPT does clears it, so every attempt still reuses the very handle the
 *    server just refused: the remount is driven by the ACL changing, not by the
 *    retry, which is exactly why it does not make this class retryable;
 *  - `SpaceSession.#reopen()` (memory/v2/client.ts) runs only from `restore()`,
 *    which only the client's `reconnect()` calls — i.e. only after a TRANSPORT
 *    close;
 *  - `sendOutstandingCommit`'s catch (memory/v2/client.ts) keeps a commit
 *    outstanding for replay on `isConnectionError`/`isSessionRevokedError` only;
 *    a `SessionError` falls through and rejects the commit with `#sessionId`
 *    untouched.
 * Those three also say which case actually reaches here. A transport drop never
 * surfaces as a `SessionError` at all — the commit queues and replays after the
 * reconnect's `reopen()`, and the server re-creates even a TTL-expired session
 * from the id the client resends (memory/v2/session-registry.ts `open`). What
 * reaches `editWithRetry` is the other case: a LIVE connection whose session the
 * SERVER dropped — an ACL de-authorization sweep (`#revokeDeauthorizedSessions`,
 * memory/v2/server.ts, whose own comment is "its next message fails closed
 * (Unknown session)"), or a takeover, both of which also delete the entry
 * `Connection.#requireSession` checks. That is terminal for the session: the
 * client's remedy is the `session/revoked` frame, which CLOSES it
 * (`terminateSession`), not a reopen — and a reopen would be denied at
 * `session.open`.
 *
 * Retrying it is therefore all cost. With no backoff the whole budget burns
 * within milliseconds on identical doomed round-trips, each one emitting a
 * subscriber revert from `finalizeRejection`; and it DOWNGRADES the reported
 * error, because once the revocation frame lands `#assertOpen()` throws
 * `SessionRevokedError`, a name `toRejectedError` does not preserve — so the
 * caller is handed a generic `TransactionError` instead of the real cause it
 * would have seen on attempt 1. Move it back into the allow-list the day the
 * retry path clears `#sessionHandle`, or the client reopens on `SessionError`:
 * the convergence argument is sound, only the remount is missing.
 * (2026-08-26 — the READ path's half of that gap is now closed, and it is
 * worth being precise about which half. `consumeOwedSessionRemount` remounts
 * when the ACL CHANGES, which is the only event that can change this verdict;
 * a commit RETRY is not that event, so the sentence above still stands for
 * this predicate. What would move `SessionError` into the allow-list is a
 * retry path that waits for the remount rather than one that re-fires
 * immediately.)

 *
 * It is an allow-list on purpose. A rejection class introduced tomorrow — a new

 *
 * The four admitted cases and their convergence argument:
 *  - stale basis from upstream ({@link isConflictRejection}) — the retry runs
 *    after the conflict's `readyToRetry` catch-up gate, against fresh state.
 *  - stale basis locally ({@link isStorageTransactionInconsistent}) — a value
 *    read during the transaction changed on this replica; re-reading resolves.
 *  - liveness ({@link isTransientCommitRejection}) — the commit was never
 *    evaluated, and the client re-establishes the connection on its own, so a
 *    retry lands it. `SessionError` is the near miss that is NOT admitted: same
 *    "never evaluated" shape, but no one remounts the session between attempts;
 *    see that predicate's doc for why, and for what would change the answer.
 *  - discarded attempt ({@link isDiscardedAttemptRejection}) — the attempt
 *    never reached storage and the caller asked for a fresh one.
 *
 * Plus one marker-driven case: an `AuthorizationError` the SERVER tagged
 * `retriable` (the session-open anti-replay race a fresh handshake heals — see
 * memory/v2/session-open-auth.ts, and `isNonRetriableAuthorizationError` in
 * memory/v2/client.ts, which reads the same marker). An unmarked
 * `AuthorizationError` is terminal, including the ACL bootstrap denial
 * ("Space … requires an ACL genesis commit before ordinary writes",
 * memory/v2/server.ts): that denial CAN clear if a concurrent genesis lands,
 * but retrying it here is not how it clears — `editWithRetry` re-runs with no
 * backoff, so all attempts complete within milliseconds of each other, and the
 * runner's own genesis runs at session open (storage/v2.ts) rather than
 * concurrently with a replica's writes. Failing fast surfaces the real problem
 * instead of hiding it behind six identical denials. If that race ever needs to
 * heal by retry, the server should mark the denial `retriable` — the marker,
