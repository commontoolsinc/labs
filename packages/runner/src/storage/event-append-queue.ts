// The client-side event-append queue (server-execution v2 Phase 3;
// events.md §5, speculation.md §5, LT9). Under the flag a client's
// handler fire commits ONLY the event — an authored append to the
// stream's sidecar doc (events.md §1, §7) — and this queue owns that
// commit's delivery: fired-order discharge, retry across transport
// loss and session replacement, and the duplicate-as-delivered
// classification the dedupe horizon makes sound.
//
// Why a queue and not a bare transact: events are INTENTS. Unlike an
// ordinary authored write — whose CAS staleness needs application-level
// repair, so the storage layer deliberately rejects it on transport
// death — an event append is safe to resubmit forever: admission
// dedupes by eventId above the stream's `eventWatermark`
// (events.md §4), the engine's replay check covers the same-session
// resend, and the server signals "already appended" with a NAMED error
// (`EventAppendDuplicateError`) precisely so a discharging client
// treats it as delivered rather than re-raising forever (events.md §5's
// duplicate-submission rule).
//
// Ordering: strictly one in-flight append per space, PER-STREAM fired
// order — events.md §5's "discharge on reconnect in fired order" is the
// per-stream requirement (a stream's sidecar carries that stream's
// entries; nothing on the wire orders one stream against another).
// Unpaced, the queue sends the fired-order head, which serializes the
// whole space in fired order as a consequence. Under OW27 pacing the
// next send is the earliest-fired entry whose STREAM has a token: a
// paced stream holds only its own later sends, never an unrelated
// stream's (no cross-stream head-of-line hold — the P7 review's
// finding 5, ruled per-stream independence), and one in-flight append
// per space still holds.
//
// Persistence class (LT9, RE-RULED 2026-08-15 — owner): the queue is
// PROCESS-LIFETIME. Queued-but-undischarged intents surviving a client
// RELOAD is a NON-GOAL this round — in the owner's words, the status quo
// does not survive a client + server reload either — so the queue rides
// an injectable {@link EventAppendQueueStore} whose ONE shipped
// implementation is in-memory and MANAGER-SHARED: it outlives any single
// SpaceReplica, so an in-process provisional-replica REPLACEMENT hands
// the successor queue the predecessor's undischarged intents (that
// in-process loss is machinery loss, not reload loss, and stays fixed).
// The durable Web-Storage adapter and the reload self-start path that
// Phase 3 carried for the earlier "durable" ruling are RETIRED with the
// re-ruling; the recorded future shape, if reload survival is ever
// wanted, is per-tab persistence + orphan adoption (verification-
// coverage.md's closed OW20 row). Sessions are per tab: one writer per
// session by construction, no leader election, no shared persisted
// session.

 * `burst` sends pass immediately, sustained sends drain at
 * `ratePerSecond`, and a flood (key-repeat driving `stream.send()`)
 * is HELD, in that stream's fired order, never coalesced and never
 * dropped — events are intent, and dropping loses it. Streams are
 * INDEPENDENT: the buckets are per stream and so is the hold — the

 * paced stream never holds an unrelated stream's sends (no cross-stream
 * head-of-line hold; ruled with the P7 review's finding 5) while each
 * stream's own fired order stays exact (its entries share one bucket
 * and are scanned in fired order).
 *
 * The bound this imposes on the flooding user's OWN legitimate rapid
 * interactions is the dial: with N sends queued past the burst the
 * newest waits ≈ (N − burst) / ratePerSecond seconds. The default —
 * 20/s sustained, 20 burst — is a starting posture, FLAGGED for the
 * owner (Phase 7): a person's deliberate clicks never reach it, a
 * held key (≈30 Hz auto-repeat) is paced to 20 commits/s and clears
 * within half a second of release. `false` disables pacing (tests;
