// The client half of the client-effect channel (server-execution v2
// Phase 4; docs/specs/server-side-execution/protocol.md §5): every
// flag-ON NON-serving runtime subscribes to its own session's instance
// of the well-known effects doc in each space it connects to, ENACTS
// unacked intents (navigation — the one shipped kind), and ACKS by
// nonce with an ordinary AUTHORED write into the session's own instance
// (the plan's interim-postures Phase-4 row). The instance resolves from
// the runtime's authenticated session — the client names no scope key
// (T2.Q3).
//
// Exactly-once per nonce is THIS side's duty (protocol.md §5), kept by
// the ENACTED-NONCE RECORD — process memory, deliberately reload-wiped:
// a reload between intent and ack re-reads the unacked intent on
// resubscribe and MAY re-enact it, which is ACCEPTED for reversible
// effects (LT8, RULED 2026-08-03). The record has two writers, both
// through `beginEnactment` (record BEFORE the enactment settles, with
// its outcome attached):
//
// - the OPTIMISTIC path — the speculation overlay begins the run's
//   deterministic nonce here BEFORE its navigateTo flush runs
//   (speculation.md §2; the flush awaits an arbitrary callback, and the
//   authoritative intent can arrive mid-flush), so the authoritative
//   intent CONVERGES on the in-flight nonce and never re-navigates
//   (T2.Q7);
// - the AUTHORITATIVE path — an intent arriving unenacted (a reload, a
//   client that never speculated the run) is begun, enacted, and — on
//   SUCCESS — acked here (record-before-invoke guards re-entrant
//   deliveries).
//
// The ACK FOLLOWS ENACTMENT SUCCESS (protocol.md §5: the client
// "enacts, then commits an authored ack write"; owner review P1-1,
// 2026-08-12): every ack chains on the enactment's outcome, and a
// FAILED enactment retracts its record instead of acking — the entry
// stays unacked in the store, so a later delivery (any commit touching
// the instance, or the LT8 reload re-read) retries. Acking a failed
// enactment would let the server retire a navigation that never
// happened — permanent loss.
//
// The ack is once-per-nonce and the server-side retirement is
// idempotent, so the accepted LT8 re-enactment never doubles anything
// downstream of the client.
//
// HOW the channel watches its doc (server-execution v2 stage C design
// (e), item 13 — RULED 2026-08-18: "the effects-channel sink follows the
// same redesign, as (e)'s second step"): a NON-REACTIVE storage-
// notification listener keyed on the subscribed spaces, not a schema-less
// whole-doc `cell.sink`. The sink was a scheduler effect that re-read
// every entry on every change of the session's effects doc — following
// each intent's `args.target` link into the navigated-to doc (a demand
// leak) — and paid the CFC probe over that read set; the same shape as
// the intent watch, on a smaller doc. Now: ONE `storageManager.subscribe`
// per channel, the doc kept WATCHED through the schema-less selector
// (`sync(id, { path: [], schema: false }, "session")` — also the LT8
// resubscribe re-read), and ONE coalesced MICROTASK reconcile per
// (space) that reads the RAW replica doc: no transaction, no proxy, no
// probe, no scheduler node, no demand edge. The reconcile itself is
// unchanged.
