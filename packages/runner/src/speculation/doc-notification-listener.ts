// A NON-REACTIVE storage-notification listener for a small set of docs
// (server-execution v2 stage C design (e), RULED 2026-08-18 — design
// §5 items 4 and 15: the intent watch "may be a non-reactive
// storage-notification listener outside the scheduler", on
// `storageManager.subscribe`).
//
// The shape it replaces was a schema-less `cell.sink` over a WHOLE doc:
// a scheduler EFFECT node that ran on every change of the doc, minted
// two transactions per run, deep-traversed every entry FOLLOWING PAYLOAD
// LINKS into other docs (a demand leak), and paid the CFC flow-relevance
// probe over that read set on every commit — O(entries²) per change on
// the stream sidecar (the attribution's 65 % of a saturated worker; the
// design's §3.1). Nothing in the spec asks for a reactive effect there:
// the consumer only needs to know THAT its doc changed and, ideally,
// WHERE (design §3.2).
//
// This listener subscribes ONCE to the storage manager's notification
// relay — the same `IStorageNotification` relay the scheduler consumes —
// and, per notification, filters the merged changes to the docs a
// consumer currently WANTS: O(changes) map lookups, no transaction, no
// query proxy, no CFC probe, no scheduler node, no `idle()`
// participation, no demand edge. It records the LEAF-granular change
// paths the differential already computed (a consequenced mark arrives
// as `["value","entries","<i>","consequenced"]`; an append as
// `["value","entries"]`) and calls the consumer ONCE per (space, doc) in
// a MICROTASK — never inline: the replica dispatches notifications
// inside its commit / integrate step, and a consumer that resolves
// verdicts (dropping speculative layers through the rollback path) or
// calls arbitrary UI subscribers must not interleave with that
// integration (the `#sealSpeculative` deferred-sweep precedent). A
// `reset` notification carries no changes and is relayed as
// `id === undefined` for its space (everything the consumer tracks there
// is dirty).
