// The client speculation overlay (server-execution v2 Phase 2;
// speculation.md is normative). Under EXPERIMENTAL_SERVER_EXECUTION a
// NON-serving runtime — every client, and any server-side utility
// runtime that is not the space's SpaceServer — loses its
// derivation-commit path BY CONSTRUCTION: the runtime's default seal
// destination is this overlay, so a stamped derivation-kind run's
// writes are REDIRECTED into the replica's optimistic pending layer
// (`sealNative` with a speculation verdict) instead of a storage
// commit. There is no client code path from a derivation run to the
// wire, and none that could construct a `derived`-class commit
// (protocol.md §1's FORBIDDEN clause holds structurally).
//
// What stays on today's commit path, exactly (the plan's Phase 3
// interim postures row — F10's handler interim ENDED with events-down,
// events.md §7):
// - bookkeeping runs (the client-side pattern swap's pointer write is
//   an ordinary authored input);
// - UNSTAMPED transactions — UI-binding writes, imperative edits, and
//   the event-append commit itself (the fire's one authored act,
//   events.md §1) are state authorship under existing ACL + CAS
//   (README §3.6), and they never pass through the scheduler's
//   stamping choke points.
//
// Event-HANDLER runs divert here exactly like derivation runs since
// Phase 3 (D-v2-1): the handler's writes are the speculative ECHO
// (speculation.md §2), tagged with the fired event's id so the echo
// retires when the authoritative consequences (or the dropped-event
// notice) arrive (speculation.md §4 step 2; the watermark sweep is the
// backstop). The client handler-write COMMIT path is deleted — there
// is no code path from a handler run to the wire (events.md §7).
//
// The overlay is process-memory only (speculation.md §1): entries are
// never serialized, never synced, never committed, and they stay OUT
// of the client's `synced()` durability barrier. Reads see them
// through the replica's ordinary pending materialization, so rendering
// and downstream speculation read one code path. Reconciliation
// (speculation.md §4) is watermark-driven: when the space's replicated
// watermark doc covers an entry's read basis — and no unpromoted
// authored origin still underlies it (the "acked AND W ≥ seq" rule,
// evaluated on replica state) — the entry retires via a
// SUCCESS-shaped withdrawal (`superseded`), the authoritative value
// replaces the echo in the same render path, and nothing cascades.
//
// Retirement TRIGGERS (speculation.md §4; stage C tuning T2): the sweep
// runs from the watermark-doc sink, the origin-ack observer, chained
// settlements, the post-seal microtask — and, since stage C, from the
// replica's ARRIVAL observer: a frame that moves the confirmed seq of a
// doc some entry WROTE re-sweeps at once. Before that wake, "a served node
// retires the moment its derived value arrives" held only because the
// derived doc and the covering watermark advance rode ONE frame; an
// EXHAUSTED wave carries no watermark movement (its derivedThrough is
// frozen — serving-loop.md §3), so its derived values arrive DECOUPLED
// from W and an entry whose floor W already covered stood until the next
// watermark event. With the honest flush deadline (T3) that is the
// ROUTINE shape of a busy wave, which is what the wake closes. The gate
// itself is unchanged — the arrival is a second, earlier TRIGGER, never a
// relaxation of the coverage or arrival predicates. Its soundness
// argument: the sweep's predicates are evaluated afresh on replica state
// at every trigger, so an extra trigger can only retire an entry the gate
// would have retired at the next watermark event anyway; the arrival of
// the authoritative value IS the landing the gate waits for. (The
// attribution's 48-s lockdown-chip stall itself is a DIFFERENT entry —
// a late event echo whose floor sits ABOVE every reachable W; see the
// late-echo rule at `#sealSpeculative`. Its mechanism is inferred from
// the red runs' evidence — no prompt echo, a worker busy for 8.7–12 s —
// not witnessed by a client trace.)
//
// Post-commit effects of a speculative run follow the egress rule
// (README §1): "speculate on anything you can throw away; never on
// anything you can't take back." Reversible, client-enacted effects —
// exactly the `navigateTo` kind today (optimistic enactment,
// speculation.md §2) — still flush; every other kind (external-sink
// egress, sqlite issue) is OWNED AND DROPPED, so an effectful builtin
// reached by speculation renders its pending state and reads through
// to the last committed result while only the server performs egress
// (README §3.5).

    // seq — above every W reachable until the next authored input — so it
    // stood indefinitely, hiding the served value (the attribution's E2:
    // 48 s until an unrelated draft lifted W). Disposition: the run's
    // writes are DROPPED before any layer is sealed (the closed-overlay
    // arm's shape — the results are re-derivable, and here already
    // derived authoritatively); the seal reports ok so the scheduler's
    // run completes normally. Same-tick soundness: an intent is terminal
    // only through a store signal or an admission refusal, both of which
    // this overlay recorded before this seal ran.
    // The rule reaches the late echo's CASCADE too (self-review finding
    // 2): a send from inside the late run queues a client cascade child
    // under a MINTED id (never an intent, never terminal) whose echo
    // would seal over served state, register, and stand with the same
    // floor-above-W shape — the parent's `parentEventId` names the
    // jobless intent, and the dropped run's own id joins the set so
    // grandchildren fold in. The server's authoritative run of the intent
    // produced (or produces, in later waves) the durable cascade; the
    // client's late copies have no job at any depth. "At any depth" is
    // literal (combined review 2026-08-19, F1): the check walks the
    // WHOLE `parentEventId` chain through `#cascadeParents`, not just
    // the direct parent — a SILENT (write-less) forwarder child has no
    // entry, is never retired, and never joins the jobless set, so a
    // one-level check let its LATE grandchild register after the root's
    // mark and strand forever (no mark of its own ever comes; its

   * this never reaches.
   *
   * AND every entry that is a client CASCADE DESCENDANT of that intent
   * (stage C W2.1 — the late-echo rule's jobless-cascade consequence,
   * applied on arrival): the intent's speculative run sent events whose
   * echoes sealed under client-minted cascade ids (`parentEventId` names
   * the thread). The server's authoritative run of the intent produced
   * the durable cascade under its OWN ids, so nothing will ever name the
   * client's: no mark (no tracked entry), no arrival (a cascade handler
   * that cellifies a new object writes an entity doc whose id derives
   * from the handler frame's cause — `$event: tx.dispatchedEventId`,
   * runner.ts — so the client's entity id is not the server's and the
   * sweep's arrival gate never passes). The intent's terminal consequence
   * — consequenced, errored, dropped, refused: every arm reaches here —
   * is the one signal that makes the whole cascade jobless, exactly as
   * the late-echo rule treats a cascade sealed AFTER it (W0 l3's
   * "duplicate join": spec-Alice standing beside the confirmed Alice
   * forever). Scope, precisely: ONLY entries whose thread reaches the
   * intent — client-minted cascade children of its speculative run,
   * never a durable entry of its own (a root fire's echo carries no
   * `parentEventId`; an unrelated intent's cascade does not reach it).
   * The retired child's id joins the jobless set so a LATE grandchild
   * (sealing after this) drops at seal like a late child does.
   *
   * The known cost (W2.1, flagged — the reason the owner-level
   * alternative exists): when the server's LT1 child was PURGED at the
   * flush deadline (W3's α1) and the drain delivers it a wave later, the
   * cascade echo goes at the parent's consequence while the child's own
   * consequence is still a wave away — the echo's value disappears until
   * that wave lands, a visible flicker. Counted: `cascade-echo-retired`
   * per retired cascade echo, and — when the caller arms the witness
   * with the MARK's sidecar (the consequenced, non-error arm: the one
   * case where a server cascade child is on its way) —
   * `cascade-echo-retired-unarrived` when NO doc the echo wrote holds a
   * confirmed value at or after the mark frame's seq (read as the
   * sidecar's confirmed seq at the check: the mark and a same-wave
   * child's writes commit together, so a child that rode the parent's
   * wave has moved every doc it wrote to that very seq, and a purged
   * child has moved none). A HEURISTIC, two misreadings stated on the
   * getter. Keyed on the mark's seq rather than the echo's read basis
   * on purpose: a concurrent writer (the other voter's vote, landing
   * between the echo's seal and the mark) moves the doc past the basis
   * without the child having landed — the lunch gate's own shape.
   * Keeping the echo until the child's own delivery is covered by W is
   * NOT done: the durable child entry carries no parent reference and
   * this client does not watch the child's stream, so there is nothing
   * to match the echo against (the owner-level shape is deterministic
