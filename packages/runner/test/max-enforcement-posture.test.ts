/**
 * The max-enforcement CFC posture as one running system (CT-2075's follow-on
 * to the preset goldens in `runtime-presets.test.ts`, which pin the bundle's
 * SHAPE). CT-2075 found two of the bundle's dials load and run without ever
 * demonstrably firing in ordinary flows — "on and silent" is not "verified
 * enforcing" — so each test here makes one of them decide an outcome that
 * the same flow without the dial would decide the other way:
 *
 * - policy evaluation: an egress fits the bundle's public-only network
 *   ceiling ONLY because the §10.1 value-screened discharge dropped the
 *   caveat clause first — and refuses without the screening evidence;
 * - trigger-read gating: a scheduled egress that never re-reads the secret
 *   that triggered it is still held to the sink ceiling;
 * - refusal-as-event: the ceiling refusal of a reactive action's commit is
 *   terminal and reaches the scheduler's error channel with its reasons,
 *   rather than reading as a healthy, quietly empty piece.
