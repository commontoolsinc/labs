/**
 * Abandoning the post-commit effects a transaction staged and lost.
 *
 * A post-commit effect has two outcomes and runs exactly one of them: `flush`
 * when its transaction commits, `abandon` when no further attempt at that
 * commit is coming. The decision belongs to whoever owns the retries, so the
 * transaction's part is narrow: dispatch once, never after a commit succeeded,
 * and never through a wrapper standing for work whose outcome nobody acts on.
