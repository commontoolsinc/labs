// idle() consults the head event's park state while a wake timer is armed.
//
// waitForQuiescence has a branch that fires when a wake timer is pending and the
// event queue is non-empty: it asks whether the head event is parked (a
// time-gated retry, or a handler still loading) before deciding to keep idle()
// open. Reaching the head-park check needs two facts true at the same re-check —
// a wake timer armed and an event queued.
//
// This drives both from the real scheduler: a debounced computation that is
// invalidated after its first run arms the shared wake timer and waits, and an
// event queued against a piece stream sits in the queue until the next tick
// dispatches it. idle()'s first evaluation runs synchronously when called, so
// with the wake armed and the event still queued it takes the head-park check.
