/**
 * What the conversion refuses, and why it has to refuse rather than carry on.
 *
 * The walk rebuilds every container it descends out of that container's own
 * entries, so a container that is not inert has to be turned away before it
 * reaches the rebuild. Rebuilding one drops a named property, a symbol key or
 * a non-enumerable string key, and evaluates an accessor-backed slot into a
 * data property -- each yielding a container that satisfies
 * `isValidFabricValue()` while meaning less than the input did, which nothing
 * downstream can catch because what it produces is genuinely valid.
 *
 * The refusals are asserted at a nested position as well as at the top,
 * because the vetting is per-position: the walk reaches each member as a
 * conversion input in its own right.
