// Regression: a reactive EFFECT whose optimistic commit fails with a cross-replica
// ConflictError recovers and re-runs against fresh state — WITHOUT consuming the
// reactive retry budget — exactly as a computation is.
//
// ConflictError is kept out of the reactive retry budget (a conflict is a wait for
// catch-up, not a failure). Recovery is guaranteed by the catch-up re-queue in
// watchReactiveActionCommit: re-arm the subscription, wait for the conflict's
// `readyToRetry`, then re-run. The cross-replica ConflictError's read-repair sync
// re-triggering the effect via reader-dirty is a redundant fast path. The
// off-budget conflict-skip is intentionally NOT gated to computations — effects
// take the same path. A same-replica race is a StorageTransactionInconsistent,
// which keeps its bounded retry; only the cross-replica ConflictError reaches this
// path.
//
// Coverage gap this fills: compute-conflict-recovery.test.ts asserts the reader-dirty
// PREDICATE for computations; commit-conflict-reconcile.test.ts exercises read-repair
// on a MANUAL tx. Neither drives a scheduler-managed EFFECT commit through a real
// conflict and back to recovery.
//
// Harness: two Runtimes share ONE server, each with its own replicas (recipe from
// commit-conflict-reconcile.test.ts). The writer (A) advances the shared doc; the
// replica under test (B) is left provably stale, so B's effect deterministically
// reads the stale value and its commit conflicts.
