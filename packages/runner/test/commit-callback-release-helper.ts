/**
 * Helper for commit-callback-release.test.ts. Runs in its own process so it
 * can use `--v8-flags=--expose-gc` and the real clock (WeakRef state only
 * settles across task boundaries, which the package's fake-clock preload
 * would freeze).
 *
 * A commit callback runs exactly once, when its transaction settles. The
 * question here is what the transaction holds afterwards. Callbacks are
 * closures over the machinery that registered them — a child registry, a
 * result cell, an action's captured frame — so a settled transaction that
 * keeps its callback set keeps all of that reachable for as long as anything
 * still references the transaction. Long-lived structures do reference
 * settled transactions (a cell carries the transaction it was created with),
 * so this is a live retention path, not a theoretical one.
 *
 * The helper registers a callback whose closure captures a sentinel object,
 * commits, drops every reference except a WeakRef to the sentinel and a
 * strong reference to the settled transaction, and reports whether the
 * sentinel is still reachable.
