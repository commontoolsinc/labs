// A reactive computation whose commit is refused for a stale basis is re-run
// after the conflict's catch-up gate (watchReactiveActionCommit). That re-run
// is the scheduler's own, not a fresh input change, so it is queued past the
// node's freshness gates: a trailing debounce or a throttle must not hold it
// (scheduler-v2 §8.3).
//
// The shape that found this: a COLD replica's first run reads a document it
// never synced as absent, commits a `seq: 0` claim over it, and is refused.
// With the debounce re-armed on the re-queue, the retry was a deferred re-run
// of an "already-ran" computation — by design not idle work, and given an
// expiry wake only by a live demander. A one-shot `pull()` has none once it
// resolves, so the retry never ran and the refused first output stood in for
// the computation's answer.
