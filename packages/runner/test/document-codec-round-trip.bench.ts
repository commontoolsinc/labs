/**
 * What a commit costs in codec work, and what that cost is set by.
 *
 * A document crosses the storage boundary as wire text: committing one encodes
 * it, and the other side parses it back and deep-freezes the object graph that
 * comes out. A commit makes about eighteen of those crossings whatever it
 * writes — but each one carries a WHOLE document, so writing a single scalar
 * moves as many bytes as the document holding it, not as many as the write.
 *
 * That is the shape a collection runs into. A board keeps its list in one
 * document and writes on every change, so the bytes each write puts through
 * the codec grow with what the board already holds while the number of
 * crossings stays flat. Seeding a board is a run of such writes, which is why
 * its cost climbs faster than the number of things on it.
 *
 * Two commits, differing only in the size of the document they land in:
 *
 *   - **small document**: a scalar on a document of a few kilobytes. The floor
 *     — what a commit costs before the document under it counts for anything.
 *   - **large document**: the same scalar write, on a document two orders of
 *     magnitude larger. The write is identical; the difference is what the
 *     document costs to move.
 *
 * Each write stores a value the document did not already hold, because a write
 * of the value already there is elided and commits nothing — a benchmark
 * written without that lands on the elision path and reports it as the cost of
 * a commit.
 *
 * The diagnostic reports the wire size of both documents. That is the quantity
 * the difference between the two timings is made of, and unlike them it does
 * not depend on the machine.
 *
 * Environment controls:
 * - CODEC_PADDING_ROWS: lines of prose in the large document, default 400
