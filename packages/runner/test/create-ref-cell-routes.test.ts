/**
 * The routes by which `createRef()` gets an encodable form out of something
 * cell-shaped: a cell, the query result standing for one, a cell whose link
 * nothing has materialized yet, and a builder artifact that happens to be a
 * function.
 *
 * Two cells at different paths of one document holding equal contents run
 * through most of it, because anything identifying a cell by its contents
 * rather than by what names it answers the same for both. The one input that
 * fails closed is a cell method: a reactive proxy makes it and a same-named
 * data key one object with one encodable form, so a derived id cannot say
 * which was meant.
