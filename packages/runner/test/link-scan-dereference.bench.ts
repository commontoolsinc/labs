/**
 * What it costs to walk a list of links through a materialized view.
 *
 * This is the shape a derivation takes when it reads a list whose elements are
 * references: the view materializes an element on access, materializing it
 * resolves the link the element is, and resolving a link records a dereference
 * hop on the transaction. So the cost of the walk is the cost of one hop times
 * the number of them, and a derivation declared over a whole list pays it
 * again on every change to any element of that list.
 *
 * The fixture is a row list of the shape a pivot table has: each element is a
 * link to a row document, and each row names its subject with a second link.
 * Touching a row therefore costs two hops, which is what makes a scan's hop
 * count a property of the list rather than of the walk that reads it.
 *
 * Three groups, each measuring the same walk against a different state of the
 * transaction it runs on:
 *
 *   - **first**: the walk that pulls each row document into the transaction
 *     for the first time. The floor for a view that has to load.
 *   - **repeat**: the same walk again on the same transaction, where every hop
 *     is one this transaction has already resolved and already recorded. What
 *     separates it from **first** is what a resolution keeps.
 *   - **past a write**: the same walk with a write in front of it, which is
 *     the shape a board is actually read in — something is always being
 *     written — and drops the resolution memo the repeat walk hits.
 *
 * One runtime and one seeded list serve the whole file, and every iteration
 * aborts its transaction, so no iteration pays for a runtime, a store, or a
 * document write, and none leaves state behind for the next.
 *
 * **repeat** and **past a write** each walk once untimed before the bracket,
 * so their timed window finds every row already in the transaction and
 * measures only what the interlude cost. **first** times its only walk, which
 * is what makes it the cold baseline: the load is the thing it is there to
 * report.
 *
 * Environment controls:
 * - LINK_SCAN_ROWS: rows in the list, default 50
