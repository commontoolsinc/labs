// Epic D4 — per-write read-prefix provenance

// maxConfidentiality input checks quantify over each protected write's READ
// PREFIX: the labeled reads whose activity-clock position precedes the LAST
// write attempt overlapping the protected path (either prefix direction —
// the same overlap floor applicability uses). The doc's §7.5 red-first list
// is pinned here:
//   - the §3 re-attempt counterexample REJECTS (and would pass under the
//     unsound first-attempt bound — a regression guard);
//   - the §4 child-write aliasing counterexample REJECTS (and would pass
//     under exact-path last-write keying);
//   - a read past the last overlapping write no longer gates (the precision
//     payoff — this rejected under the pre-D4 transaction-global gate);
//   - trigger reads sit at -Infinity and join EVERY write's prefix;
//   - an empty-prefix floored write is decided by the D3 value-side floor
//     under its dial (the #14 vacuous-pass resolution — see the comment in
//     verifyInputRequirements);
//   - a post-prepare reorder of the interleaving invalidates (digest tests).
