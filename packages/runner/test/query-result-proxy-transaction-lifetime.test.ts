// The two readings of the query-result proxy machinery.
//
// `createQueryResultProxy` builds a standing handle on a cell: it resolves the
// transaction afresh on every access, so a holder keeps reading current state
// after the transaction it was made against has finished. Long-lived consumers
// depend on that — a tool call dispatched by the LLM builtin, a SQLite result
// flushed after commit, a piece started on demand.
//
// A transaction marked for lazy materialization turns the same call into a view
// over the state that one transaction sees, fixed at creation. Reading after
// the transaction finishes throws instead of quietly reading from committed
// state, which is what a materialized read wants: the value it describes is the
// value that was there when it was taken.
