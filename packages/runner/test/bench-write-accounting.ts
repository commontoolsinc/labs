/**
 * Counts what a storage transaction wrote: how many documents it touched, and
 * how many JSON bytes it put into them.
 *
 * `tx.journal.novelty(space)` yields one attestation per written path, and a
 * single `cell.set()` produces many: the path the write was made at, and a path
 * for each slot below it that changed. Each value is a snapshot taken as its
 * own part of the write landed, so a write below the root shows up as a
 * container recorded empty with its contents on the paths under it, while a
 * write of a whole document shows up as the document value with its parts
 * repeated under it. Adding up every attestation counts the same bytes several
 * times over in the second shape, and drops the key names in the first.
 *
 * These functions read the attestations as what they are: a set of writes, some
 * of which sit inside others. For each document they keep the writes no other
 * write encloses, and rebuild each one's value from the writes below it. What
 * comes back is one value per top-level write, which is what that transaction
 * put into storage.
 *
 * The journal a transaction wrote is only readable while the transaction is
 * open. `commit()` releases it on the way to settling, so a caller that wants
 * these numbers reads them before it commits.
