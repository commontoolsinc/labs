/**
 * A terminal CFC refusal ends the RETRY sequence, not the subscription.
 *
 * Classifying the boundary refusal as terminal stops the scheduler
 * re-running a doomed computation against unchanged inputs. It must not also
 * strand the action: when a value the run READ changes, the action re-runs on
 * that change like any other. Nothing in the terminal path touches
 * subscription or trigger registration — the resubscribe is on the run path,
 * keyed on the run having happened at all — and this pins that end to end.
 *
 * It asserts that the action RE-RUNS, not that the re-run's write lands: CFC
 * labels are monotone, so a source cannot be un-labelled and a re-run over
 * still-labelled data is refused again, correctly. Re-running is the property
 * under test; whether the fresh verdict differs is policy's business.
 *
 * A METADATA-only change (widening a declared label over a byte-identical
 * value) does NOT re-trigger a reader, and that is correct rather than a gap.
 * A result computed under the policy that existed at the time was computed
 * legitimately; it does not retroactively fall under a later policy, it comes
 * under one when it is recomputed. The next run over a changed value sees the
 * widened label and is judged by it, and the existing derived document keeps
 * the label it was actually derived with — so nothing is laundered, and what
 * a tightening does not get is retroactivity.
 *
 * Monotonicity is the other half of why: a label can only widen, so a re-run
 * provoked by a metadata change could only ever be refused — it cannot repair
 * anything. Revisiting already-derived values under a new policy would be a
 * re-enforcement sweep, which is a different design from a trigger.
 *
 * The behaviour is pre-existing either way — an action that succeeds and
 * never meets a refusal does not re-run on a metadata change either — so it
 * is documented here rather than pinned as a test.
