/**
 * Type-level tests pinning what a serialized node's bindings can hold.
 *
 * If any assertion here is wrong, this file fails to compile.
 *
 * `Node.inputs` / `Node.outputs` and `Pattern.result` hold what
 * `withAliasBindings()` produces: a structure of `$alias` records and data
 * whose leaves include `FabricPrimitive`s. `JSONValue` cannot express a
 * `FabricPrimitive` — it is a class instance with zero enumerable own
 * properties — so declaring these fields `JSONValue` was false, and was held
 * up by `as unknown as JSONValue` casts at the producing end.
 *
 * The negative assertions are the point. A positive assertion alone would pass
 * just as well against the old `JSONValue` typing for the plain-data cases,
 * proving nothing about the change; each `@ts-expect-error` below fails to
 * compile if `JSONValue` ever does accept these, which is what makes this a
 * differential rather than a restatement.
