// Regression guard for $ref resolution inside policy value matching.

// The schema generator emits named types as `#/$defs/<name>` refs with the
// `$defs` on the root schema (e.g. profile-home's owner-protected `elements`
// list: `{type: "array", items: {$ref: "#/$defs/ProfileElement"}, ifc, $defs}`).
// The pre-fix matcher recursed into `properties`/`items`/compound branches
// without threading the root document, so a nested `$ref` was resolved against
// the bare ref node itself, warned "Unresolved $ref", and failed closed — the
// policy entry was treated as not applying even though the schema was valid.
// Only a ref that is genuinely unresolvable against its document may fail
// closed.
