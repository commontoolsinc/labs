/**
 * Measures source collection over labeled transaction reads as their count grows.
 *
 * The sizes are the axis: scanning every source already kept costs the square
 * of the consumed-source count. Each address contributes two distinct atoms,
 * so 458 and 2668 sources mean 229 and 1334 reads, with nothing to deduplicate.
 * All reads share a document, exercising path identity on every comparison.
 *
 * `root label` holds label-map width at one. `field labels` puts the same two
 * atoms at each read path, holding read and source counts fixed while growing
 * metadata width. This separates source dedup from per-read label-map work.
 * Both use four-segment logical paths and real emulated storage transactions.
 * They measure the collector, not lift/map execution or pane startup.
 *
 * Construction, value reads, assertions, and cleanup are outside timing. Each
 * sample uses a fresh transaction so verifier-read journals cannot accumulate.
