// idle() convergence-hold tests (scheduler-v2 F1).
//
// The settle loop caps a pass at MAX_ITERS iterations and, when a live subgraph
// is still churning at the cap, defers its frontier with a convergence backoff
// wake (~BACKOFF_BASE_MS later). That backoff is the deliberate escape valve
// that lets idle() resolve for a genuinely non-converging (cyclic) subgraph.
//
// F1 (fixed here): a backoff-deferred RE-RUN of an already-ran DEMANDED
// COMPUTATION whose downstream effect is still CLEAN at cap time used to block
// nothing, so idle() resolved mid-wave and callers sampled a pre-convergence
// graph — the effect only ran on the later backoff wake. The fix holds idle()
// open for such a deferred computation, but only for a bounded number of
// consecutive backoff passes (CONVERGENCE_IDLE_HOLD_MAX_BACKOFF_PASSES), so a
// true cycle still resolves idle() via the escape valve.
