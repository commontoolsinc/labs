/**
 * Post-genesis ACL mutation against a real memory-v2 server.
 *
 * The pre-existing `acl-manager.test.ts` mocks the runtime wholesale — fake
 * cell, fake `editWithRetry` — so it cannot observe the commit the runner
 * actually emits. That is precisely how a bug shipped in which every ACL
 * mutation after genesis was refused by the server ("ACL mutations must
 * replace the space-scoped ACL document"): the runner decomposed the write
 * into `op: "patch"`, the server requires a whole-document `op: "set"`, and no
 * test in the suite could see the difference. `memory-v2-acl-bootstrap.test.ts`
 * uses a real server but only ever covers genesis.
 *
 * These tests therefore assert the emitted OPERATION SHAPE, not just a green
 * path. A patch-based "fix" that happened to succeed, or a fix that only
 * succeeded on a retry, would pass a value-only assertion and fail here.
