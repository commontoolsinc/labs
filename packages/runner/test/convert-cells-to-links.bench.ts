/**
 * What the conversion costs per container, and what frozenness costs on top of
 * it.
 *
 * The two arms carry the same data and differ only in whether it is frozen.
 * That is worth measuring because the shallow conversion at the top of each
 * container is asked for the frozenness the value already has, so that a value
 * already in fabric form comes back as itself rather than as a copy the
 * rebuild below would discard. **The two arms agreeing is the result**: a gap
 * between them is a copy being made on one side and not the other.
 *
 * The payload is shaped like a value a subscription carries -- a list of
 * records, each with a few scalars, a nested array, and one link -- rather
 * than a single wide container, since what the walk pays for is containers
 * visited rather than bytes moved.
