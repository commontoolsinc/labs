/**
 * Setting up a piece whose argument document already exists writes that whole
 * document, so what the write carries decides what survives. A caller names
 * some of the argument's slots and leaves the rest to the piece: a nested
 * piece is instantiated with the argument its parent's expression carries —
 * `Child({ supplied })` names one slot — and the piece's own durable state
 * lives in the slots that expression never mentions.
 *
 * These tests pin both routes a same-pattern setup takes over an existing
 * argument document: `Runner.#applySetupState`, which a piece reaches when it
 * holds no registration (the nested piece its parent restarts), and
 * `Runner.#maybeReuseRunningSetup`, which a registered piece reaches when it is
 * run again with an argument.
