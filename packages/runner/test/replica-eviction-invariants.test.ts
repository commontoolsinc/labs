// Two properties that hold today and that any change letting a space replica
// drop documents has to preserve. A replica currently keeps every document it
// pulls for as long as it is open; work to make it hand documents back has to
// leave both of these standing.
//
// These are deliberately small and fast — they are meant to be the loop you run
// while working on eviction, rather than a 100 KB suite whose failure you then
// have to localize. Neither test knows anything about how eviction is
// configured: they assert the behavior a reader is entitled to, so they answer
// the question whatever the mechanism turns out to be.
//
// What each one is a guard against:
//
//   1. A list projection whose element documents stop being read, and are then
//      read again, has to rebuild. If the elements' documents were evicted when
//      the list emptied, the restored list can come back with an empty
//      aggregate.
//   2. A commit that conflicts across two replicas has to settle. The waiting
//      side advances only when a sync frame arrives, and a sync frame only
//      arrives over a watch. If the watch behind the conflicted document were
//      given up, this would wait forever rather than fail — the wait has no
//      timer, by design.
