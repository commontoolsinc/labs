/**
 * What the instant a materialized read describes costs to keep.
 *
 * A view resolves each path against the epoch it was taken at, so reads made
 * after the reader has written have to find the root standing at that epoch
 * rather than the current one. Three groups measure that:
 *
 *   - **read**: walking a list through a view, on a transaction that has not
 *     written and on one that has. The first is the shape a lift takes — read
 *     the argument, never write through it — and is where the epoch has to cost
 *     nothing, because before the first write every epoch names the same root.
 *   - **write**: a run of writes with and without a reader holding an instant.
 *     Holding one puts the write path on the preserving branch, which
 *     deep-freezes the root it displaces so the next write clones instead of
 *     editing it where it stands.
 *   - **interleave**: a read taken between every write, which is the shape that
 *     makes every write preserve. The write group amortises one preserve over
 *     its whole run and so understates this.
 *
 * One runtime is built for the whole file and every iteration aborts its
 * transaction, so no iteration pays for a runtime, a store or a seeded document,
 * and none leaves state behind for the next. Each `fn` also runs its body once
 * untimed, so the timed window is not the one that pays for the transaction's
 * first document load.
 *
 * Environment controls:
 * - LAZY_VIEW_EPOCH_N: list size, default 1000
 * - LAZY_VIEW_EPOCH_WRITES: writes per iteration, default 50
