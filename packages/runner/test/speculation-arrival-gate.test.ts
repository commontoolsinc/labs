// Server-execution v2 — the client speculation ARRIVAL GATE
// (speculation.md §4, RULED 2026-08-16; landed with fan-out stage A as
// its own commit): an input-origin overlay entry retires on ARRIVAL of
// the authoritative value for every doc instance it wrote — a CONFIRMED
// value at seq ≥ the entry's floor — not on watermark coverage of its
// basis alone. Coverage without arrival is the OW32 retire-to-nothing
// loop: the echo dropped to nothing, the writer (subscribed to its own
// output through the scope-narrowing write path) re-derived,
// re-speculated, retired, forever, on any instance the server never
// served (a per-user node the demand walk did not reach; a served node's
// first wave not yet landed at boot).
//
// - the OW32 shape (the triage's probe): a flag-ON client with NO serving
//   host, a `computed` over a PerUser input (its output scope-narrows
//   into `computed:X/user:<self>`), a watermark that covers the basis
//   with NO store value for the instance → the echo STAYS (bounded runs,
//   entry live, the client value renders, no non-settling episode);
//   mutation (gate removed) → the loop returns;
// - arrival: the store's value for the instance lands at seq ≥ floor,
//   the covering watermark re-sweeps → the entry retires and the store
//   value renders;
// - rider "own retirement is not a trigger": the flip a retiring echo
//   produces carries the echo's own transaction as its source, and the
//   scheduler does not re-dirty that transaction's action for it — a
//   writer subscribed to its own output does not re-derive on a
//   divergent authoritative value, re-speculate, and loop through the
//   gate (mutation: the `integrate` arm of the own-source skip removed →
//   the writer re-dirties);
// - rider "supersede-by-newer" (destination-level, scripted): a newer
//   entry of the same writer whose whole-doc ops cover an older entry's
//   docs retires the older one at seal; a PATCH does not; another writer
//   does not.
//
// Stage C tuning T2 (speculation.md §4's owed ARRIVAL RE-SWEEP + the
// LATE-ECHO rule; stage-c-attribution-report §4):
// - the E2 shape: a served derived value that arrives DECOUPLED from a
//   watermark advance (an exhausted wave carries none; W already covers
//   the entry's floor) retires the echo and renders — without waiting for
//   an unrelated commit to lift W (mutation: the arrival observer removed
//   → the entry stands until the next watermark event);
// - the arrival wake is FILTERED to docs some entry wrote and never
//   relaxes the gate (scripted: an arrival for an unrelated doc sweeps
//   nothing; an arrival while W < floor retires nothing);
// - a LATE echo — an event-handler echo sealed after its intent's
//   TERMINAL consequence already arrived — is dropped at seal, never
//   registered (its writes render nothing); a fresh intent's echo still
//   registers (mutation: the check removed → the late echo registers and
//   its divergent write renders).
