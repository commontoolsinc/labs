/**
 * Open question 2 (docs/specs/content-addressed-action-identity.md) resolved:
 * the artifact index (`addressableByIdentity`) is SESSION-LIFETIME — a builder
 * artifact indexed by module evaluation stays synchronously resolvable for the
 * rest of the session, no matter how many other modules evaluate afterwards.
 *
 * This is what lets the op sentinel drop its embedded `$opFallback` graph and
 * the JSON boundary go refs-only: any pattern whose module evaluated in this
 * session (every authored op — its module is part of the running piece's
 * bundle by construction) resolves via `artifactFromIdentitySync`, eviction-
 * free. The module-namespace cache (`modulesByIdentity`) stays bounded: its
 * misses recover through the async storage-backed load.
