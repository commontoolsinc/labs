/**
 * The verdict / non-verdict split a CFC prepare rejection turns on.
 *
 * A refusal is terminal — never retried, surfaced — only when every reason is
 * a VERDICT on the transaction's data. Anything else can decide differently on
 * a fresh attempt: an input prepare could not evaluate, a resolution that
 * failed, a prepared state a caller disturbed. Collapsing the two strands the
 * write, which is the failure OW50 exists to surface rather than reproduce.
