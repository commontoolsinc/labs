/**
 * Measures what one dispatched handler event costs, phase by phase, as the
 * list its bound context reaches grows. Every sample sends one event through
 * the scheduler to a compiled handler and waits for its commit; the timed
 * interval runs from the send to the commit callback. The dispatch's phases —
 * presync, dependency preflight, argument read, body, post-run, commit — are
 * read back from the phase timers the runtime already keeps — as the time
 * each timer accumulated between a snapshot before the send and one at the
 * commit callback, so a phase that runs twice in a dispatch counts twice
 * and a phase that did not run in it counts nothing — so the whole dispatch
 * and its parts come from the same interval. The runtime's drains after
 * the callback sit outside the timed interval, and so does the reset of the
 * counter before each sample and of the list after the one workload that
 * writes to it, so every sample dispatches over a list of the size its name
 * states and writes a value the store does not hold. Those timers are kept
 * per process, one active start per key, so the runtimes here run one at a
 * time.
 *
 * Two context shapes are measured. A handle context binds the list as a
 * `Writable` cell, which is what the lunch poll's handlers declare, so the
 * argument read mints a handle and the body decides what to read. A plain
 * context declares the list as a value, so the argument read materializes
 * every row before the body runs. Read counts are collected in a separate,
 * untimed pass with accounting enabled, and never in the timed samples.
