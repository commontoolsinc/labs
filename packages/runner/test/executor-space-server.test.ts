//
// - the §6-step-5 ACTIVATION RE-SEND: durable append rows written by a
//   wave that crashed/parked before delivery are delivered by the next
//   activation (delete the re-send call and the first test goes red);
// - the post-wave OWED drain: rows a transport-failed delivery leaves
//   behind ride the NEXT wave's drain even when that wave carries no
//   fresh appends (#outboxDrainOwed — armed by the failed activation
//   re-send too);
// - the park-race straggler drop (m-3): effects handed over for a wave
//   this server closed or abandoned are OWNED AND DROPPED — no
//   re-created #pendingEffectsByWave entry (the leak pin), no inline
//   flush firing network work for a contribution that never committed.
