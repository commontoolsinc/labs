/**
 * What joining a document's stored label costs a prepare, as the stored map
 * grows.
 *
 * A recursive read materializes everything under its path, so its effective
 * label is the entry at the path joined with every entry below it. Under
 * persisted flow labels a document accumulates an entry per written path, so
 * that join runs over a map that grows for the life of the document — and it
 * runs more than once per prepare: the write gate resolves the read labels
 * for a protected write target, and the transaction-global flow join resolves
 * them again.
 *
 * Each entry here carries an integrity atom naming its own path, so no two
 * entries contribute the same atom and the join's result is as long as the
 * map. That is the growing-label case; a document whose entries all carry one
 * shared clause joins to a result of one atom however long the map is.
 *
 * The sizes are the axis, and they are in the names, because one point cannot
 * tell a join that costs the map's size from one that costs its square.
