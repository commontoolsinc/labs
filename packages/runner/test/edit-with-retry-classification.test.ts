/**
 * `Runtime.editWithRetry` retries on an ALLOW-LIST of rejection classes, not on
 * the truthiness of the commit error.
 *
 * Before this, every commit rejection was retried: a deterministic refusal —
 * an ACL `ProtocolError` about operation shape, an `AuthorizationError`, a
 * `PreconditionFailedError` whose own interface doc says "this class is
 * PERMANENT: the client must not retry" — burned the whole budget on identical
 * doomed round-trips, each one emitting a subscriber revert notification from
 * `finalizeRejection`. With the default budget that is 6 attempts; callers size
 * budgets larger (pattern-manager: `Math.max(16, 2 * importEdges + 8)`).
 *
 * These tests therefore assert the COMMIT COUNT, not just the outcome. A
 * classification that got the right final error after five doomed attempts
 * would pass an outcome-only assertion and fail here. The counterpart —
 * a genuine `ConflictError` still exhausting its budget — is asserted here and
 * in compile-cache-writeback-conflict.test.ts.
