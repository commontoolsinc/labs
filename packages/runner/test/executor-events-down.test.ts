// Server-execution events-down, end to end against a real memory server, a

// - the FULL loop: a client fire commits ONLY the event; the
//   SpaceServer drains it, runs the handler AUTHORITATIVELY, and
//   commits consequences in ONE derived commit carrying
//   `consequenceOf` — with the entry consequence-marked and the
//   per-stream `eventWatermark` advanced in the SAME transaction
//   (events.md §2, §4); the client's echo retires on the consequence
//   signal and the authoritative value renders;
// - exactly-once across restart: an append committed with NO serving host
//   is drained once at activation (serving-loop.md §6 step 4); a second
//   activation re-runs nothing (the consequenced mark + the watermark
//   exclude it);
// - the ERROR arm: a throwing handler's error IS the consequence
//   (events.md §5) — the entry carries it, the stream does not wedge;
// - the DROP arm: an event whose piece can NEVER start defers for the
//   bounded creation-race window, then hardens into the
//   `{status: "dropped", reason}` notice (events.md §5's predicate;
//   the deferral is bounded, and does not erase the drop);
// - the SKIP arm: an at-or-below-horizon duplicate admission is
//   skipped at processing, counted `skippedIdempotent`, and passed by
//   the frontier (events.md §4/§5; the model's C2-dedupe pin);
// - LD1 at cardinality 2: two users' fires run as their OWN actors —
//   `firedAt` stamps distinct users, and the wave's attribution
//   annotations carry each event's actor on its consequence writes
//   (protocol.md §1/§2, scopes.md §5).
