/**
 * `experimentalConcurrentWatchRefresh` at the RUNNER storage layer: watch-
 * refresh round trips may overlap up to a bounded window instead of the default
 * strict single-flight. (The memory-client ordering guarantees — wire order
 * across the set/add family and ordered delivery through the real server — are
 * covered in packages/memory/test/v2-concurrent-watch-refresh-test.ts, where
 * the in-package server/loopback helpers are available.)
 *
 * Everything here is event-driven (no wall-clock sleeps): progress is awaited
 * on transport signals, and the "nothing more happens" assertions use a
 * deterministic microtask drain, not a timer.
