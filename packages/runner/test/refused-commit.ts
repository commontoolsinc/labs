 *
 * The whole of a reserved `grant:cfc:` document is policy state that only
 * `writeCfcGrant` may write, so an ordinary write to one is recorded at the
 * transaction's write chokepoint and prepare refuses over it. The refusal is
 * a verdict on the transaction's data, so it reaches the caller under the
 * terminal `CfcCommitRefusalError` name. A case that wants the refusal a
 * PARTICULAR gate decided wants {@link prepareAndCommit} instead.
 *
 * `space` is the space to write the reserved document into; the write never
 * lands, so any space the transaction can address will do.
 *
 * The refusal exists from `enforce-explicit` upward, so a transaction below
 * that is raised to it. A caller's own stricter rung is left alone, and a
 * caller that names none takes this rung rather than whatever the fleet
