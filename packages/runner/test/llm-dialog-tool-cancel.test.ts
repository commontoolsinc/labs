/**
 * Cancelling a dialog turn has to reach a tool call that is still running.
 *
 * A turn is aborted when the durable `pending` cell goes false — which is what
 * `cancelGeneration` does, so the effect reaches every replica — or when a newer
 * request supersedes it. That abort used to reach only the model call: the tool
 * path took no signal, so a tool that was mid-run carried on to its own
 * deadline, and only its writeback was discarded. The work was never stopped.
 *
 * The two cases here cancel a turn at the same moment and check different
 * halves of what that has to mean.
 *
 * The first calls one tool and requires the turn to come to rest without
 * logical time jumping the tool-call deadline — that is, to have ended on the
 * cancel rather than by waiting the deadline out.
 *
 * The second calls two tools in one answer and requires the one not yet reached
 * never to run. Its side effect is a flag set inside the handler, so it fails
 * if the loop invokes that tool before consulting the signal. This is the
 * sharper of the two: `handleInvoke` runs the pattern or sends to the handler
 * before reaching its own wait, so racing the signal inside that wait leaves
 * the later tools of a turn free to fire their effects first.
 *
 * Neither pins the race participant inside the wait — that the abort ends a
 * call which would otherwise never finish. Doing so needs a pattern tool whose
 * result cell genuinely stays undefined, and the obvious spellings do not: a
 * pattern returning `{}` or `undefined` still leaves the cell defined, so the
 * wait ends on its own and the abort is never what freed it. Until such a
 * fixture exists that participant is covered by inspection, while the loop
 * guard, the cancellation reporting, and the run being stopped are covered
 * here.
