// Scheduler-side characterization of the conflict/subscription coupling: which
// readers leaf-only reader-dirty propagation re-triggers, and which it does not.
//
// A reactive compute whose commit fails with a granular ConflictError is
// recovered by re-queuing after the conflict's catch-up gate (see
// scheduler/action-run.ts). Reader-dirty propagation is a redundant fast path:
// it re-runs the compute sooner when the catch-up write lands as a fresh
// notification, but only for readers the write actually dirties, and that set is
// leaf-only:
//
//     readerDirty(write, read)  iff  the write's leaf paths overlap the read
//
// So the fast path does NOT cover every conflict. Two code paths set the bounds:
//
//   - commit-conflict (memory engine `validateConfirmedReads` -> `patchOverlapsRead`)
//     PARENT-INJECTS before #4220: an `add` of `votes/alice` touches
//     `[votes/alice, votes]`, and the injected parent `votes` prefix-matches a
//     read of the disjoint sibling `votes/bob`  ==> CONFLICT.
//   - reader-dirty (scheduler `arraysOverlap`, fed by leaf-only
//     `schedulerTouchedLeafPathsForPatch`) is LEAF-ONLY: `votes/alice` does not
//     overlap `votes/bob`  ==> NOT a reader, NOT dirtied.
//
// So a compute that reads one key, racing a peer that adds a disjoint sibling
// key, can get a granular ConflictError that reader-dirty never re-triggers.
// #4220 aligns the commit-conflict matcher onto the same leaf-only paths the
// scheduler uses, so that spurious conflict disappears at the source; the
// scheduler's catch-up re-queue is the backstop that recovers any genuine
// conflict the fast path misses. Neither layer relies on the other for
// correctness.
//
// Coverage split (both layers exercised independently; neither is reachable from
// a single-replica runtime test, where the client-side whole-document
// attestation guard short-circuits with `StorageTransactionInconsistent` before
// the engine's path-granular matcher runs):
//   - commit-conflict layer: packages/memory/test/v2-engine-test.ts ->
//     "memory v2 engine: leaf-only commit conflict — disjoint-key writers merge".
//     That test PASSES with #4220's leaf-only matcher and FAILS (ConflictError,
//     validateConfirmedReads) on the parent-injecting matcher — i.e. it flips
//     exactly at #4220, which is the commit-conflict half of the coupling.
//   - reader-dirty layer: the assertions below, on the real scheduler predicate.
