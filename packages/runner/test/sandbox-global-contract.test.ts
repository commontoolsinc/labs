 * disagree in the direction of the compiler promising more, a pattern type
 * checks, compiles and deploys, and then throws a `TypeError` in the user's
 * hands — every gate passes and the failure lands where it costs the most.
 *
 * The libraries are read from the same asset cache the compiler reads, and the
 * globals are the ones the runtime really installs, so neither side can drift
 * without failing these tests.

 * - `declare function X(...): ...;`, the free functions such as `setTimeout`
 * - `declare namespace X { ... }`, where `Intl` hangs its members
