/**
 * What makes the report the subject here decidable at all is the document it
 * writes to. A resolved wish emits a `cf-cell-link` as its `[UI]`, whose
 * `$cell` prop is a link to the wished-for cell, so the stored label map
 * carries a link-origin entry under `[UI]`. A value write reaching a path
 * the stored label map reaches is refused unless something names the schema
 * it was authored against, and that refusal reads `missing schema
 * write-policy input`.
 *
 * The dials are the shell's (`packages/lib-shell/src/runtime.ts`), stated
 * rather than inherited because the refusal is the subject. The runner's own
 * flow-label default is `off`, and under `off` a transaction carrying only
 * raw value writes is never CFC-relevant, so the report commits without the
 * boundary looking at it.
 *
 * A wish-state document is addressed by a content-derived id, so a
 * throwaway runtime is what learns the address the cases then seed.
