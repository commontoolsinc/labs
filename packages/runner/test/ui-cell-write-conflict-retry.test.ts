// The cfc-group-chat-demo :133 stall's missing CONSUMER, pinned at the
// runner seam (register: verification-coverage.md OW45's PHASE-3 groupchat
// observation; rootcause §2b; live evidence: 4/4 tap-instrumented reds,
// each `stale confirmed read … conflicted with …` on the piece argument
// doc's `hostMessageDraft`, 2026-08-27).
//
// Mechanism, in three layers:
//  1. ENGINE (already pinned in
//     packages/memory/test/cellset-structural-precondition.test.ts): a
//     blind `$value` write threads a shape precondition at its cell's
//     PARENT; a concurrent structure change there admits first and the
//     engine refuses the write as `stale confirmed read` — a ConflictError
//     the ruled vocabulary classifies RETRYABLE (storage/rejection.ts:
//     catch-up, then a fresh read converges). Under server execution a
//     serving wave routinely lands exactly such structure (the first /cfc
//     labelMap stamp, a sibling key add) on the argument doc concurrently
//     with typing.
//  2. CONSUMER (this file): the UI write path (handleCellSet/handleCellPush
//     → applyCellWrite) fired `tx.commit()` and dropped the result, so the
//     retryable rejection's readyToRetry gate had no consumer: the USER'S
//     INPUT was silently and permanently lost — no retry, no log, no
//     counter — while every served derivation over the draft (the send
//     button's disabled state) stayed correctly stale forever.
//  3. LIVE (the integration file): cfc-group-chat-demo.test.ts:133 red
//     5/6 at 23cf68e7d running alone, every red store missing the draft.
//
// The cross-replica staleness itself cannot be manufactured in this
// in-process harness — it propagates shared state synchronously (the
// recorded limitation in the engine test's own header) — so the conflict
// here is INJECTED on the first commit attempt in the engine's exact
// stale-read shape, and a vocabulary pin below keeps the injected shape
// honest against the classifier the retry protocol actually consults.
