/**
 * Type-level tests pinning `handler()`'s overload resolution — the BUILDER
 * half.
 *
 * If any type assertion is wrong, this file fails to compile.
 *
 * This file cannot see the surface a pattern compiles against. A pattern
 * resolves `commonfabric` to `api/index.ts` and type-checks against
 * `HandlerFunction` there, which is a separate hand-maintained declaration of
 * these same signatures. An overload present here and missing there is
 * invisible to every pattern while this file stays green — the exact failure
 * mode `action`'s declared-result overload shipped with. The matching half is
 * `packages/api/test/handler-function-surface.test.ts`; a change to the
 * overloads below belongs in both.
 *
 * The ordering of `handler`'s overloads is load-bearing and a comment cannot
 * fail a build. The `=> any` forms absorb every inferred callback — that is
 * what keeps an incidental return from being read as a declared verb result.
 * Reorder them, or delete one, and inference starts picking those returns up
 * silently. These assertions fail if that happens.
