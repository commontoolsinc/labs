/**
 * `runtime.settled()` must span a whole llmDialog turn.
 *
 * `settled()` is the runtime's "everything has finished, including async
 * builtin I/O" barrier, and it is what lets a caller wait on an LLM turn
 * without a deadline or a poll. It only covers work a builtin hands to
 * `runtime.trackAsyncWork()`, so a builtin that tracks a promise settling
 * before its real work is done makes the barrier lie: `settled()` returns while
 * the request is still in flight, and the only ways left to wait are watching a
 * value or arming a timer.
 *
 * This reads the dialog immediately after `settled()` returns, with no other
 * wait in between, so it fails if the barrier does not cover the turn.
