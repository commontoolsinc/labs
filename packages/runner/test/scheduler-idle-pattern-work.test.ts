// The client durability barrier covers pattern-manager program work
// (verification-coverage.md OW45, seat S-B — the client half of the
// home-profile program-write loss): `Scheduler.idleWithPendingCommits`
// is the client's "safe to navigate or reload" checkpoint — its
// contract is "once it resolves, tearing the page down loses no
// writes" — but a program-materialization commit travels through the
// pattern manager's OWN async chains: a by-identity load that
// cold-compiles and re-persists a space's program docs, and the
// compile-cache write-back that IS the program commit. Pre-fix those
// chains lived outside the barrier (that is why
// `flushCompileCacheWrites` exists as a separate call), so a client
// that reached idle and reloaded killed the trailing create's program
// commit — the space then served nothing forever (rootcause §1; the
// serving-side halves are OW31 S-A and OW46 S-D).
//
// Pinned here at both levels:
//  1. the barrier CONSULTS the pattern manager and holds until its
//     pending work settles (and plain `idle()` — reactive quiescence
//     only, by contract — does NOT);
//  2. the accessors read the REAL registries those chains register
//     into — the in-progress compilation map (the compile-and-run
//     floating-promise phase), the single-flight load slot, and the
//     persistence set — so an entry in any of the three holds the
//     barrier, and once the barrier resolves no pattern work is in
//     flight.
