/**
 * Work registered with `Scheduler.trackBackgroundTask` holds `idle()` open
 * until it settles, and releases it whether it succeeded or failed.
 *
 * Reactive quiescence is a statement about the graph: nothing running on it,
 * nothing scheduled to. Work the runtime has already undertaken off the graph —
 * fetching a system pattern so a surface a builtin has already emitted can be
 * filled in — leaves the graph quiet for the whole time it is in flight. A
 * caller reading idle as "nothing more is coming" reads it wrongly there, which
 * is what tracking such work as a background task fixes.
