// Resume preservation guard for the list builtins (filter/flatMap).
//
// On a reload the result container of a `filter` can already hold its durable
// non-empty value while the per-element predicate result cells are still
// streaming in from storage. While a predicate cell reads `undefined` (its
// value not yet arrived), the coordinator's reconcile treats the element as
// excluded and republishes a shrunk aggregate, overwriting the durable list
// with a partial/empty array — the user-visible reload flicker where a
// populated list blinks to empty and refills (e.g. the Lunch Poll vote swatches
// going 35 -> 0 -> refill). The correct behavior: do not let a per-element run
// whose result is still pending clobber a known durable aggregate; preserve the
// prior value until the children settle, then reconcile normally (so a child
// that genuinely settles falsy/undefined is still excluded — convergence, not
// freeze).
//
// The reload is staged in the transport rather than timed. A resume asks
// storage for two batches of documents: the aggregate's own container together
// with the input list, and, behind it, the per-element runs. Both are held. The
// test lets the coordinator run once against nothing, releases the container
// batch, lets it reconcile while the per-element batch is still withheld, and
// only then releases that. Each step waits on an edge the transport reports, so
// the sequence is the same on every run.
//
// Delaying the second batch on a timer instead cannot promise that sequence.
// The coordinator's resume work and the delivery are then ordered by whatever
// the event loop did on that run, so the window is wide, narrow or closed by
// luck and the assertions below check a different scenario each time.
