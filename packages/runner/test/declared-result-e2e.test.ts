// A CTS-authored `action<Event, Result>` verb, compiled through the real
// pipeline (`patternManager.compilePattern` → js-compiler → CTS transformers →
// SES evaluation), delivers its returned value into the event receipt under
// the `plainResultReceipts` experimental flag (default-on since the flip) —
// the composition of this
// package's plain-return projection (scheduler-event-receipts.test.ts, which
// exercises only the raw trusted-builder `handler`) with the api's declared-
// result authoring surface. This is the readback half of WS-C's exit
// criterion, pinned at the runner in addition to the end-to-end fixture
// (docs/history/plans/pattern-verb-contract-implementation.md, D4).
//
// The incidental-cell-return case pins the receipt write's conversion: `set()`
// returns its cell for chaining, so an expression-body
// `action(() => cell.set(...))` returns a live Cell. The receipt write goes
// through the cell's standard write flow, so that return is recorded as a LINK
// to the mutated cell — receipts reflect what was returned (a raw write fails
// the whole handling on the live object instead).
