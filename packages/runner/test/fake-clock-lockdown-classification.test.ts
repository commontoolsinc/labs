// The fake-clock harness (auto-advance mode) sorts every positive-delay
// `setTimeout` into a `src/` timer, which auto-advances so the runtime's own
// throttle/backoff windows elapse instantly, or a `test/` timer, which freezes
// so a stray wall-clock sleep written in test code deadlocks and the async-op
// sanitizer catches it. It decides by reading the scheduling frame's file path.
//
// SES's `errorTaming: "safe"` (the runner's production lockdown) blanks
// `new Error().stack` for the rest of the process from the first lockdown on.
// Reading the frame through `new Error().stack` therefore saw nothing after
// lockdown, and every test-scheduled sleep was misfiled as a `src/` timer and
// auto-advanced — silently defeating the freeze-and-catch guarantee for the
// whole suite. The harness reads the frames through SES's `getStackString`
// hook, which keeps returning them after lockdown (the same hook the runtime's
// own error mapping uses). These tests pin the classification across the
// lockdown boundary and the SES contract it stands on.
