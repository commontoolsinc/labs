/**
 * OW50 (server-execution v2, verification-coverage.md §3; seat S-J): a crash
 * inside CFC commit-prep must surface as a FAILED COMMIT, never as an escaped
 * throw that kills the action without settling its transaction.
 *
 * The live shape (first-on-ci-gate.md row 3 / on-render-stall-rootcause.md
 * §4a): the wish builtin's /result declaration is
 * `anyOf: [{type:"undefined"}, <requested schema>]`, and when the requested
 * schema carries ifc (the profile consumer view), a SECOND writer's
 * commit-prep against the STORED envelope walks into
 * `mergeCfcSchemaEnvelopes`, whose entry assert
 * (`assertNoDivergentIfcBranches`) THROWS "ifc inside divergent anyOf
 * branches is unsupported at /result". Under ON the serving loop is the first
 * writer and the browser's raw:wish is the second, so the client action dies
 * at prep: the throw escaped `prepareCfc`, the transaction never settled (no
 * rollback callbacks), the scheduler's run promise never resolved, the resolve
 * re-entry threw AGAIN into an unhandled rejection (the logged
 * SES_UNHANDLED_REJECTION), and the wish UI silently never mounted.
 *
 * Contract pinned here (red before the fix):
 *  1. `prepareCfc()` does not throw on a prep crash — it records the crash as
 *     an invalidation reason (fail-closed, same as every modeled refusal).
 *  2. `commit()` then rejects through the standard pre-storage-rejection
 *     path: the caller gets `{error}` naming the crash, and commit callbacks
 *     fire with that error (rollback observers run).
 *  3. The scheduler survives: an action whose commit-prep crashes fails like
 *     any refused commit — the error is observable, no unhandled rejection,
 *     and unrelated actions keep running.
 *
 * The divergence assert itself (cfc/schema-merge.ts) is DELIBERATELY not
 * touched: whether ifc-under-anyOf becomes mergeable is the CFC owner's call
 * (register row OW49). This file pins only detectability — the S-J seat.
