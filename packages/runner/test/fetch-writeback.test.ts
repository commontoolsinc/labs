/**
 * What the fetch builtins report when a completion writeback cannot be
 * written, which is two different things.
 *
 * The writeback is the last step of a fetch: the response has arrived, and
 * `tryWriteResult()` puts it in the result cell. Its two "did not write"
 * outcomes are _distinct_ for the caller. Inputs that moved mean the request
 * was superseded, so the new inputs' own request owns the cells and there is
 * nothing left to do. A commit the storage layer refused means the opposite —
 * the claim is still durably pending and this response was the only completion
 * it will ever get, so `fetch.ts` must not retire the effect as fulfilled. It
 * converts that refusal into an error-shaped result instead, and propagates
 * when even that cannot commit.
 *
 * Those failure reports run nowhere except where a writeback's commit is
 * refused, which a suite reaches only by tearing a runtime down around one, so
 * a suite that does not construct the refusal covers them or not according to
 * how the run was scheduled. Each case here constructs the refusal it wants,
 * which is what makes the reports run on every suite run and under every shard
 * layout. `docs/development/COVERAGE.md` ("Failure reports reached only when
 * the operation fails") carries the reasoning.
