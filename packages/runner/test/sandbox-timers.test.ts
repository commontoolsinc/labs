// The SES pattern compartment endows no timers (part of the structural barrier
// pinned by security-timing.test.ts). Pattern code that needs a delay — API
// clients doing retry/backoff — must therefore guard its timer use: read
// `globalThis.setTimeout` (a member access that yields undefined in-sandbox,
// not a ReferenceError) and no-op when it is absent, so backoff degrades to an
// immediate retry rather than throwing. These tests pin that the compartment
// omits the timers, that a RAW `setTimeout(...)` call throws inside it, and
// that the guard used by the API clients resolves immediately there.
