// A pattern that maps over durable data must accept the rows its PRODUCER
// actually writes. Nothing checks that agreement: the row's element schema
// comes from the consumer's own type, the rows come from a handler in another
// pattern, and the two only meet when a stored row is re-staged.
//
// `favorites-manager.tsx` declared `tag: string` — required, no default — while
// home's `addFavorite` has only ever written `{ cell, tags, userTags,
// spaceName, id }` (`tags`, plural). Every stored favorite therefore failed the
// row's argument validation on resume:
//
//   updated arguments do not match the candidate schema:
//   element: missing required property tag
//
// The row never instantiated, the scheduler re-threw on every pass, and that
// loop starved the runtime — `cell:resolveAsCell` for the row's cells stopped
// being answered, so the links fell through to placeholder text and the tab
// read as empty. Nothing reached the page console: the throw is inside the
// worker runtime. One property with no producer, invisible for weeks.
//
// This drives the REAL shipped pattern over a row of exactly the shape
// `addFavorite` writes, THROUGH A PATTERN SWAP. Both halves matter. Adding a
// favorite to an already-running piece never re-stages the argument, so a
// fresh-data test stays green against the bug — which is precisely how the
// mismatch survived every existing test. The swap is what production does when
// the auto-update moves a piece to new source, and it is the moment the stored
// row is checked against the schema.
