/**
 * The prepared digest binds the SET of dereferences a transaction performed,
 * never the number of times it read each link. Both halves of that rule are
 * pinned here: a repeat collapses, and dereferences differing in any field
 * stay apart — including the pair that a payload field named `value` produces,
 * whose canonical path still opens with the element canonicalization strips.
 *
 * Only `canonicalizePreparedDigestInput`'s handling of `dereferenceTraces` is
 * in scope. Each other field of the digest input is covered alongside the gate
 * that depends on it, the write-attempt log's ordering in
 * `cfc-write-prefix-provenance.test.ts` among them.
