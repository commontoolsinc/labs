// A property whose NAME happens to match a member of `Object.prototype` is
// ordinary data. `toString`, `valueOf`, `hasOwnProperty` and the rest are legal
// keys — unlike `__proto__`/`constructor` they are not refused by the
// FabricValue boundary (#5264), so they store and round-trip like any other.
//
// Several paths asked whether such a key was present with `in`, which walks the
// prototype chain. The answer was always yes, for every object, so:
//
//   - schema defaults were never applied for those names, and the caller got
//     `Object.prototype`'s FUNCTION where the schema promised a value;
//   - a binding keyed on such a name matched every object and forwarded the
//     inherited function as the bound value;
//   - writing `undefined` to such a key looked like a no-op and was dropped.
//
// These pin the fix at the two paths reachable from the public API. Each has a
// control case using an ordinary name, so a harness that stops exercising the
// path fails loudly rather than passing vacuously.
//
// Sibling of the same bug class in the query-result proxy's
// `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` trap (#5357).
