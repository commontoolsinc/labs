/**
 * Every instantiated pattern must name the file it was DEFINED in — including a
 * nested sub-pattern, which is the population that cannot get this from
 * anywhere else.
 *
 * A pattern reloaded by identity carries no program (`patternFromMain` is the
 * source-free path on purpose), so `getPatternProgram().main` is undefined for
 * sub-patterns. The source path is stamped instead, at module-index time, and
 * the vintage gate uses it to map a recorded instantiation back to a file.
 *
 * The failure this guards is subtle: stamping the module export is not enough,
 * because a sub-pattern reaches the runner as a derivation COPY (instantiation
 * binds on mutable copies, never the frozen export). A lookup that probes only
 * the exact object misses every nested pattern while the entry pattern still
 * resolves — so the gate looks healthy and silently validates nothing nested.
