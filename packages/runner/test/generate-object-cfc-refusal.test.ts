/**
 * A generateObject request whose staging commit CFC refuses.
 *
 * The builtin stages its request state — the pending flag, the request hash a
 * later run recognizes — in the transaction that schedules the work, and sends
 * the request once that transaction commits. Under the strict dials a refusal
 * of that commit is an ordinary runtime event, and these tests pin what the
 * builtin does with one: it settles, once, with the refusal as its error, and
 * the request it could not send is staged once rather than once per retry.
