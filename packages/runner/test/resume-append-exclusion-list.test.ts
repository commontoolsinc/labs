// Companion to resume-append-exclusion.test.ts (the filter case): flatMap shares
// the same per-element run machinery, so an element appended to its input during
// the resume-await window — while the per-element op result documents are held
// back by the transport — must converge into the aggregate. The op projects a
// numeric field (`item.n`), whose per-element result document carries the same
// `["element", ...]` link path the shared gate matches, so the window is held
// deterministically (no timers). flatMap pushes the per-element result VALUE into
// its aggregate, so a value lost to a reverted resume reconcile freezes the
// appended element out — the defect the post-sync recovery in flatmap.ts fixes.
//
// map is deliberately not covered here. Its aggregate holds element-cell
// REFERENCES that resolve through the projection rather than copied values —
// which is exactly why a reverted per-element write does not freeze it (the same
// reason map does not use the resume-republish machinery) and why it is immune to
// this bug. That reference-shaped output is also why it cannot run under this
// gate: resolving the container reads through to the per-element result cells, so
// startup itself would block on the held documents.
