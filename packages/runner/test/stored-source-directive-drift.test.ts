// CT-1916 (2026-07-28 estuary): a `@ts-expect-error` that was valid when a
// pattern was AUTHORED becomes "unused" (TS2578) once the platform's vendored
// types improve — and the same stored bytes then hard-failed recompile on
// load, bricking every piece embedding them (loom-mobile patterns vs. a
// jsx.d.ts that gained `label`; the space root died with "failed to load
// piece"). The split contract under test:
//
// - the STORED-source reload path (`compileResolvedToRecordGraph`, the only
//   compile of bytes nobody can re-author under a toolchain newer than the
//   one that accepted them) tolerates the stale directive;
// - AUTHORING compiles (`compilePattern` — cf check, deploy, corpus) stay
//   strict, because there the author is present and the fix is removal.

const space = signer.did();

// Valid TypeScript whose directive suppresses nothing — the exact shape a
// platform type-improvement leaves behind in stored source.
