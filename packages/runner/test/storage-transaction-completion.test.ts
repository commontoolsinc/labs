// A transaction's read and write activity is consumed while it is open: the
// scheduler takes the reactivity log when the action that opened the
// transaction finishes, and the commit path takes the write details before the
// result is known. Holding that activity past a completed commit pins every
// address the transaction touched, so anything that keeps the transaction — a
// cell bound to it, a cleanup closure that captured it — keeps those too. A
// list projecting a window that moves opens one transaction per move, so this
// is the difference between a bounded working set and one that grows with
// every page turn.
//
// A transaction that never reached storage is the other case. The scheduler
// re-establishes an action's dependencies from the reads of the transaction it
// aborted or had rejected, and retries the action; releasing those would leave
// it with no dependencies and nothing to wake it.
