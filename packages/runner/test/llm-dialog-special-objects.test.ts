/**
 * The two walks in `llm-dialog.ts` that carry a `FabricValue` give the two
 * special-object kinds opposite treatment, and neither is the object branch. A
 * `FabricPrimitive` is a leaf and stands whole, where a walk that rebuilt it
 * from its entries would hand the model a bare `{}`. A `FabricInstance` is a
 * container reached by its codec contents, which neither walk can do, so each
 * refuses rather than flattening one.
