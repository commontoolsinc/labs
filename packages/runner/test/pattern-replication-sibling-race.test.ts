// OW45's lunch forever-park (CI run 33138358110, ON shard 7, the last
// ON-skip entry): the runner's cross-space CHILD replication
// (`replicate(parentSpace -> childSpace)`, runner.ts's CT-1687 call) can
// race the SIBLING replication that is still supplying the parent space
// itself — `compileOrGetPattern`'s content-cache hit fires
// `replicate(cached.space -> parentSpace)` fire-and-forget, and the child
// replication follows within the same handler run. The child's one-shot
// origin read then found the parent empty, threw "source closure
// unavailable in origin space", and nothing ever re-issued it (the
// documented retry is "the next child creation" — a user creates their
// profile once): the child space never received its program closure, its
// 40 demanded roots deferred `pattern-unloadable` forever (the OW46
// detector's 80-warn signature), the profile name never resolved, and the
// host's `#lp-join-button` never rendered.
//
// The race is deterministic-by-construction here: the child replication is
// issued synchronously after the sibling, and its origin read is strictly
// less work than the sibling's read-plus-write, so unfixed it ALWAYS reads
// the parent space before the sibling writes it. Three fixes cover the
// three supplier geometries the arc's direct-CI probes mapped, and this
// file pins all three:
//
// - the SIBLING AWAIT: a replication awaits the earlier-registered
//   replications INTO its origin space before reading
//   (registration-ordered tickets — acyclic, event-driven, no timers);
// - the FALLBACK ORIGIN (the direct-CI probe 2 geometry, run 33160430927:
//   the parent space never receives the closure AT ALL, because
//   `loadPatternByIdentity` serves the pattern from the in-memory
//   artifact index with no per-space persist when another space's compile
//   warmed it first): on a dry origin the replication retries its read
//   against the spaces this manager durably persisted the entry into —
//   content-addressed, so the copy is byte-identical and the verified
//   read stays fail-closed;
// - the IN-FLIGHT-COMPILE AWAIT (the direct-CI probe 4 geometry, run
//   33165960083: the supplier compile itself is still mid-flight at
//   consult time, so no persist exists anywhere and the fallback map is
//   CORRECTLY dry): on a dry origin AND dry map, the replication awaits a
//   snapshot of the in-flight compile registries once (cold compiles +
//   by-identity loads; never `compileCacheWrites`, its own set), then
//   re-consults; genuine absence still throws the same loud one-shot
//   failure.
//
// Layered-view note (why the race needs a missing SUPPLIER and not a
// wave): a same-runtime compile's E4-awaited write-back into a wave's own
// space is readable through the ordinary read path even before the wave
// commits (executor-wave.ts's layered view) — verified while diagnosing
// this — so only a supplier that never issued its writes can leave the
// origin empty. The in-flight sibling and the never-persisting
// index-served flow are exactly those suppliers.
