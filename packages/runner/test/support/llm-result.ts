/**
 * Resolve with the result cell of `llm`, `generateText` or `generateObject`
 * once its request has finished, and with the value that finished it.
 *
 * `runtime` is the one whose scheduler runs the pattern that writes `cell`. A
 * test that builds a second runtime has to pass that one here. Idling any other
 * scheduler drains work the cell has nothing to do with, which puts the read
 * back at an arbitrary moment and gives up everything below.
 *
 * Legacy state-returning builtins set `pending` to true in the action that
 * issues a request and back to false in the writeback that lands the response
 * or the error, so `pending === false` marks their settled state. Direct
 * generation APIs omit that wrapper: their `result` starts as a pending
 * DataUnavailable marker and settles to either a usable value or a terminal
 * unavailable reason. Reading at quiescence is what keeps both predicates
 * honest. `runtime.idle()` runs the action before the predicate is tested.
 *
 * Settled does not mean the model answered. A builtin handed neither a prompt
 * nor messages writes `pending` false with no `result` and no `error`, and this
 * wait returns on that state like any other. Assert on the field carrying the
 * output, not on `pending` alone, so a request that never went out fails the
 * test rather than passing it.
 *
 * The wait returns at quiescence, so a caller may equally read the cell it
 * passed in, as long as it does so before awaiting anything else.
