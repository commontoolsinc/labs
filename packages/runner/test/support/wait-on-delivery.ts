 * Resolves once `predicate` holds, waking on each client-side delivery
 * of the docs `wants` selects — a test-owned tap of the storage
 * manager's notification relay, the same relay the effects channel
 * consumes — with the predicate checked once up front and then once per
 * delivery burst.
 *
 * Soundness rests on one ordering: the predicate must read state that
 * is true no later than the moment a wanted delivery reaches this
 * client. An engine read qualifies — the server commits before it fans
 * out — so a predicate false at the up-front check has its delivery
 * still ahead of the already-subscribed listener, and the wake cannot
 * be missed. State nothing delivers to this client (a watermark, a
 * stats counter) never wakes this wait; that state waits through
 * `waitUntil` (wait-until.ts).
 *
 * The deadline is a stuck-condition net, not a bound on how long the
 * awaited work may take: the serving loop holds the event loop open
 * through its lease-renew interval, so a wait with no net would wedge
 * the run instead of failing it (see "Where the polling `waitFor`
 * stays" in `docs/development/waiting-in-tests.md`). Crossing it says
 * the delivery never came, never that it came slowly. Under the
 * package's fake clock the net freezes with every other test-armed
 * timer and the wait is purely event-driven.
