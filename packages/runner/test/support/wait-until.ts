/**
 * Polls `predicate` every `pollMs` until it holds, and throws naming `label`

 *
 * The deadline is a stuck-condition backstop, not a bound on how long the
 * awaited work may legitimately take, and a caller sizes it for that: crossing
 * it says the state never arrived, never that it arrived slowly. Which suites
 * wait this way rather than on an event, and why, is recorded under "Where the
 * polling `waitFor` stays" in `docs/development/waiting-in-tests.md`.
