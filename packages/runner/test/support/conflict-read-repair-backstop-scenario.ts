// The ride that only the read-repair backstop can end, shared by both guard
// fixtures so the scenario cannot drift between them.
//
// A cold replica commits a read of a document another client already wrote, so
// the server refuses the commit for its stale basis and stages the caught-up
// frame the retry is gated on. The server's fan-out is manual and never
// flushed, so that frame never arrives: the read-repair wait in
// `src/storage/v2.ts` has nothing to resolve it but the
// `CONFLICT_READ_REPAIR_TIMEOUT_MS` backstop, which the auto-advance clock
// fires as soon as the loop is idle. The commit's own assertion — it came back
// as the conflict — holds; the only trace of the skipped retry gate is the
// backstop's counted warn, which the guard turns into a failure.
