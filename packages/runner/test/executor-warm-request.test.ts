// Server-execution v2 — the EXPLICIT WARM REQUEST (serving-loop.md §1's
// third activation trigger; RULED 2026-08-21):
//
// A serving-side provisioning run that stages authored SETUP into another
// space (program materialization via `replicatePatternToSpace`, a served
// `.inSpace()` create's piece scaffolding — the wave's foreign
// provisioning batches, protocol.md §2b) issues a warm request for the
// target with the staged doc instances. The host activates a parked,
// SESSIONLESS target on it (the sibling of the carries-events admission
// arm), and the target's serving loop takes the staged instances as
// identity-less warm demand, so the setup derives.
//
// T11.Q7 stays as designed: the admission hook alone still activates
// nothing — an authored admission into a lease-less space with no live
// session and no events leaves it parked. The warm request is a separate,
// deliberate signal from the run that KNOWS it staged setup needing
// derivation, never a blanket write-trigger.
//
// The pin reproduces the home-profile reload residual (the §2b
// derivation-carriage report §4's ordering race): setup lands AFTER the
// target's transient tenure parked, the creating client's sessions are
// gone, and — before this fix — nothing ever re-demands it, so the
// staged piece's computed stays underived forever.
