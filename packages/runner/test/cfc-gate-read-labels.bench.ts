/**
 * What the CFC write gate costs a prepare that writes somewhere unprotected.
 *
 * `verifyInputRequirements` quantifies each protected schema entry over the
 * transaction's labeled reads, and building that set resolves one stored label
 * per read. Resolving one walks the label map of the document the read landed
 * in, joining every entry that bears on the path, so the set costs reads times
 * label-map size — once per write target, once per prepare. Persisted flow
 * labels are what make the second factor large: a document accumulates a
 * derived entry per written path.
 *
 * Only a schema entry declaring `requiredIntegrity` or `maxConfidentiality`
 * consults that set, so it is built on demand and a target declaring neither
 * resolves nothing. These two arms are the guard on that. They read the same
 * documents, carrying the same stored labels, and write the same values to the
 * same number of targets. The only difference is whether the target schema
 * declares a ceiling, and that is the only thing that should reach the read
 * labels: the unprotected arm measures a prepare that skips the gate, the
 * protected arm one that pays for it. A prepare that resolves the labels
 * whether or not anything consults them closes the gap between the two.
