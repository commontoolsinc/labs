  // A settled transaction must not keep the callbacks it already dispatched.
  // Commit callbacks are closures over whatever registered them — a result
  // cell, a child registry, an action's captured frame — and long-lived
  // structures do hold references to settled transactions, so a retained
  // callback set turns one settled transaction into a root for everything its
  // callbacks closed over.
  //
  // The scenario runs in a subprocess because proving release needs WeakRefs, a
  // forced collection (`--expose-gc`), and a real task boundary — this
  // package's preload freezes timers armed from test files, and the test task
  // does not expose gc.
