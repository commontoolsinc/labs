/**
 * The Fabric value classes reach pattern code as `export declare const`s in
 * `api/index.ts`, but the runtime values behind those declarations are bound
 * separately, in `builder/factory.ts`. The two sides are maintained by hand, so
 * a class can be declared without being bound -- which type-checks when the
 * pattern is compiled and then fails once it actually runs. These tests pin the
 * runtime half against the declared half.
 *
 * `types/commonfabric.d.ts` is a symlink to `api/index.ts`, and is the exact
 * artifact the sandbox hands a pattern as its view of `commonfabric`. Deriving
 * the expected names from it means this test tracks the real declarations
 * rather than a hand-copied list that someone has to remember to extend.
