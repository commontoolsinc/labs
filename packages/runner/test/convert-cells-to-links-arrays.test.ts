/**
 * A sparse array stays sparse across the conversion. A hole is not a member
 * holding `undefined`, and the two are different values in this system: the
 * conversion rebuilds every container it walks, so the rebuild is where the
 * distinction is at risk of being flattened away.
 *
 * The assertions count own keys rather than comparing shapes, because
 * `toEqual()` reads a hole and an `undefined` member as the same thing, and a
 * test written that way would pass against a conversion that filled every
 * hole.
