/**
 * A message added while a dialog turn is already running is dropped, and how
 * `addMessage` decides a turn is still running depends on who is running it.
 *
 * A dialog is durable and runs in more than one replica, so a turn started in
 * one tab is visible in another as `pending` being true. For a turn belonging
 * to another replica the only signal available is `internal.lastActivity`, a
 * heartbeat refreshed on every durable write of the turn, and `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`
 * is the bound past which that replica is presumed gone. Nothing distinguishes
 * a crashed peer from a slow one, so the bound stays.
 *
 * For a turn this replica is running there is nothing to detect: it knows the
 * turn is alive, because it is the one running it. The four cases below pin
 * that split. The second is the one that used to be wrong: a turn making no
 * durable writes for longer than the bound had the replica running it declare
 * the turn dead and start a second request against itself. A single model call
 * that runs that long produces such a turn. So does a tool call, which nothing
 * bounds, and so does a round of several, which run one after another and write
 * their results only once they have all returned.
 *
 * The two peer cases put `pending` back to true with no turn running locally.
 * That the write reaches the dialog's own durable cell is what the
 * within-the-bound case proves, by dropping a message that a dialog reading
 * `pending` as false would have taken; the past-the-bound case rests on it.
