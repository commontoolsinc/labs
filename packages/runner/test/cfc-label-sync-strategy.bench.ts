/**
 * Documents why the `getCfcLabel` per-call sync (runtime-processor's former
 * `syncMetaLinkedDocs`) was removed — and guards against reintroducing it.
 *
 * `getCfcLabel` is a DISPLAY-label read on the render hot path. It used to
 * re-sync the cell's whole root meta-graph on every call with a SERIAL
 * `await sync()` per node. Split timing put that at ~99.97% of the IPC, bimodal
 * p50 0.1ms / p95 >1s under multi-writer churn: when a node's watch is
 * mid-refresh the `sync()` blocks on a server round-trip, and serial awaits make
 * the cost the SUM of those round-trips along the whole graph. End-to-end the
 * `getCfcLabel` IPC p95 ran 0.5–4.2s at 4 concurrent browser profiles.
 *
 * The resolution: `getCfcLabel` does NOT sync at all — it is a pure, non-blocking
 * read of the current store. Its only callers are reactive UI components that
 * subscribe to the cell and re-read the label on change, so a not-yet-loaded doc
 * yields an empty label that self-heals when the subscription delivers it. The
 * caller owns liveness. End-to-end the `getCfcLabel` IPC p95 dropped to <1ms.
 *
 * A storage emulator can't reproduce the real cost — it has no network latency
 * and a single replica holds its own writes, so nothing is ever "cold" or
 * mid-refresh. This instead models the cost STRUCTURE: each genuine sync is one
 * awaited round-trip (`ROUND_TRIP_MS`); an already-present doc is a Set lookup.
 * The strategies then show their true asymptotics, ending at the pure read:
 *   - serial-await     [old] — SUM of round-trips (one per node).
 *   - parallel-batch          — ~one round-trip (all coalesced).
 *   - skip-when-present       — zero round-trips when warm; one batch when cold.
 *   - pure-read        [new] — no sync at all (caller owns liveness).
