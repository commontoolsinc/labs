/**
 * What a value costs to be checked before a cell takes it. `Cell.of()` checks
 * that its initial value holds only static data and no cycle, and
 * `addUnique()` checks each candidate for a cycle before comparing it against
 * what the list holds. Each check is a walk over every container of the
 * value.
 *
 * Three shapes:
 *
 *   - **records**: a list of records, each holding a tag list and an address,
 *     which is the shape a document takes. Three containers per record under
 *     one root.
 *   - **flat**: one object holding a hundred scalars. A single container, so a
 *     per-container cost has nothing to save here; it is the control.
 *   - **chain**: a hundred objects nested one inside the next. The walk is a
 *     hundred deep at the bottom, with every ancestor in play.
 *
 * `Cell.of()` creates no link and writes nothing, so the call is the check
 * plus wrapping the value in a schema, and what the check costs is a real
 * share of it. It is timed as a batch of `BATCH` calls on as many values,
 * each figure being the cost of the batch: one call on the smallest shape
 * runs well under the length at which Deno honors an explicit timer, and a
 * body timed whole would report its scaffolding.
 *
 * `addUnique()` is timed against a list holding one element of the same
 * shape, with a candidate that differs from it in content, so the call reads
 * the list, checks the candidate, compares it against the element, and then
 * writes it. The write is most of the call and grows with the value as the
 * check does, so these figures say what the whole call costs by shape, and
 * whether the check's share of it has moved is a question for the `Cell.of()`
 * figures. Each iteration opens a transaction outside the timed window and
 * aborts it afterward, so no iteration pays for one and none leaves anything
 * behind for the next.
 *
 * Both are run under a frame, as a handler runs, and it is pushed and popped
 * around each iteration so that none is left behind for whatever runs next in
 * the same process.
