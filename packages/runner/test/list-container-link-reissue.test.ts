// A list coordinator reaches its result container two ways, and only one of
// them is re-issued when a reconcile has to run again.
//
// `sendResult` writes the link from the node's output spot to the container it
// mints, and the reconcile that mints the container is the only one that calls
// it: every later reconcile takes the `result` the coordinator already holds in
// memory and writes the container's VALUE alone. The per-element setup writes
// have a ledger for exactly this — `trackListSetupRollback` marks each element
// `needsSetup` when the transaction carrying its writes fails, stale basis
// included, so the next reconcile issues them again. The container link has no
// such ledger, so a first reconcile whose commit is rejected leaves the
// coordinator holding a container that nothing points at, and every retry
// commits the container's value without the link. The output spot then reads
// `undefined` for as long as the coordinator lives.
//
// Each coordinator gets the same two runs, differing only in whether its first
// reconcile commits, so the rejection is what they isolate:
//
//   1. Runtime A builds the durable aggregate, then empties the node's output
//      spot. That is the state a session starts in when the spot is a fresh
//      holder over a container that persists at space scope: the container and
//      its per-element runs are durable, and the link to them is not.
//   2. Runtime B resumes over that state. On a COLD replica the container is
//      unreachable from the emptied spot, so B never loads it, and the
//      coordinator's first reconcile reads it as absent — a confirmed read at
//      seq 0 against a document the server holds at a later seq, which the
//      server rejects as a stale basis. Nothing here is timed: whether B holds
//      the container is decided by whether anything links to it, so the
//      rejection is a property of the arrangement rather than of the schedule.
//   3. On a WARM replica B already holds every document, the same first
//      reconcile commits, and the link comes back. That control is what pins
//      the rejection, rather than the emptied spot, as the cause.
//
// `map` is the coordinator issue #5633 (CT-1989) traced; `filter` and `flatMap`
// carry the same guard and the same single `sendResult` call site.
