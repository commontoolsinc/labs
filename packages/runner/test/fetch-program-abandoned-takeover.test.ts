/**
 * What a refused `fetchProgram` takeover leaves behind.
 *
 * A cache entry says who is resolving a program, and a replica that finds one
 * older than the staleness bound takes it over, because nothing reports whether
 * the replica that made it is still there. The takeover's own claim rides the
 * transaction that stages the request, so a refused commit leaves the entry
 * exactly as the other replica wrote it — and that replica may still be
 * resolving. The ending reads the entry and steps around anything that is not
 * idle, so a resolution running elsewhere keeps its entry and reaches its
 * result.
 *
 * Two replicas on one memory server are what make that arrangement real. The
 * holder keeps a program request open; the taker is the one whose commit is
 * refused, by the caveat `builtin-abandoned-request.test.ts` uses. Only the
 * taker enforces, so only the taker's commit is refused, and both run the same
 * pattern over the same argument and result cells, which is what puts their two
 * nodes on one cache document.
