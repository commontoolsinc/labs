// A pattern update must not leave durable state the new version's argument
// schema cannot read. `packages/piece/src/schema-compatibility.ts` waives one
// class on exactly that ground: over an OPEN argument object a candidate may
// name a brand-new optional field of any type, because the runner "validates
// the piece's merged durable arguments against the new schema transactionally
// before committing such an update". These cases are what makes that true.
//
// Both production update routes are covered, because they reach setup
// differently and only one of them ever validated:
//
// - HOT-SWAP: the `patternIdentity` watcher on a RUNNING piece calls
//   `applySetupState` with `sameStoredSetup = false`, so the stored argument is
//   re-staged and validated.
// - ROLL-FORWARD MATERIALIZE (`pieces-controller.ts`): the candidate's identity
//   is committed onto the root FIRST, then setup runs. The pointer then already
//   names the candidate, so a pointer-only comparison reports "same pattern"
//   and the re-stage — with its validation — was skipped. The completion marker
//   `patternSetupIdentity` is what tells the two apart: it names the version
//   that actually staged the stored argument. The same shape reaches setup
//   through `pieces-controller.ts`'s cold-start repair, whose root had its
//   pointer moved with no setup at all by `PatternUpdater`'s instantiated mode.
//
// A caller that hands setup a pattern the pointer does not name yet — the
// default-root apply, `cf piece setsrc` — was recognized as a change already
// and needed nothing here.
//
// The cold-link cases are the CT-1917 counterweight and belong in the same
// file: this validation only stays correct while "a slot I cannot read right
// now" keeps being distinguished from "a slot holding a plain value of the
// wrong type". Tightening one of these breaks the other, so a reader changing
// either sees both. `pattern-swap-link-argument.test.ts` covers the same
// deferral on the swap route in production shape.
