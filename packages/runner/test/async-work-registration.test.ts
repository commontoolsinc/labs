/**
 * Async builtin work must reach `runtime.trackAsyncWork()`, and it must reach
 * it under the run that started it.
 *
 * `settled()` and `settledFor()` are the runtime's "everything has finished"
 * barriers, and a barrier is only as truthful as its registry. Work a builtin
 * never registers is work the barrier cannot see, so the barrier reports
 * quiescence while the builtin is still running. That failure is silent, and it
 * is worse than a deadline: a deadline firing early reports a failure, whereas
 * a barrier returning early reports success with the data missing. An LLM tool
 * call waits on `settledFor()`, so an unregistered builtin hands the model an
 * empty tool result and the conversation continues as if that were the answer.
 *
 * `generateObject` was exactly that hole. Both of its paths built a promise
 * spanning the model call and the writeback, then attached only a `.catch()` to
 * it, so the whole tool-calling subagent shape ran outside the registry.
 *
 * Two halves guard it:
 *
 * - Each builtin below runs with its response held open, and both barriers must
 *   stay open for as long as it is held, while a barrier scoped to an unrelated
 *   cell must return. The pair pins both properties at once: the work reached
 *   the registry, and it reached it under the run that started it rather than
 *   under nobody, which would make every run wait for every other.
 * - The source scan fails when a builtin file grows a post-commit side effect
 *   without registering async work. A builtin added later cannot reopen the
 *   hole without either registering or saying in
 *   `POST_COMMIT_WITHOUT_TRACKED_WORK` why it does not have to.
