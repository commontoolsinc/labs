/**
 * What a builtin's abandoned-request ending reports when its own write cannot
 * commit.
 *
 * The ending is the last thing that happens for a request that was staged and
 * never sent. When its writeback is refused, a reader of the result cells sees
 * whatever was there before rather than the refusal, and nothing downstream is
 * left to say so — which is why the ending reports it, naming the builtin whose
 * cells were left as they were and the rejection that stopped it.
 *
 * A report only runs when the write underneath it fails, so a suite that does
 * not construct the failure covers it or not according to how the run happened
 * to be scheduled. This case constructs it: `settleAbandonedRequest` takes the
 * runtime it commits through, so the case hands it one whose commits are
 * refused. `docs/development/COVERAGE.md` ("Failure reports reached only when
 * the operation fails") carries the reasoning.
