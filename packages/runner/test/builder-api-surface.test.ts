/**
 * The `commonfabric` module a pattern imports has two halves that are written
 * in different packages. Its types are `packages/api/index.ts`, handed to the
 * pattern compiler as `types/commonfabric.d.ts`; its values are the object
 * `builder/factory.ts` builds, handed to the sandbox by
 * `sandbox/runtime-modules.ts`. A declaration with no value behind it compiles
 * and then reads as `undefined` when the pattern runs, and a value whose shape
 * has moved away from its declaration is worse: the pattern compiles against a
 * promise the runtime does not keep.
 *
 * `BuilderFunctionsAndConstants` is what stops that, by requiring the built
 * object to carry every value `@commonfabric/api` declares with the declared
 * type. That requirement is enforced by the type checker, so the checks here
 * are of two kinds: `@ts-expect-error` pins that fail the type check if the
 * requirement ever stops rejecting a mismatch, and runtime assertions covering
 * the last step, where the built object is frozen and handed over.
