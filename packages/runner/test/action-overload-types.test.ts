/**
 * Type-level tests pinning `action()`'s overload resolution — the BUILDER half.
 *
 * If any type assertion is wrong, this file fails to compile.
 *
 * This file cannot see the surface a pattern compiles against. A pattern
 * resolves `commonfabric` to `api/index.ts` and type-checks against
 * `ActionFunction` there, which is a separate hand-maintained declaration of
 * these same signatures. An overload present here and missing there is
 * invisible to every pattern while this file stays green — which is exactly
 * how the declared-result overload first shipped unreachable. The matching
 * half is `packages/api/test/action-function-surface.test.ts`; a change to the
 * overloads below belongs in both.
 *
 * The ordering of `action`'s overloads is load-bearing and a comment cannot
 * fail a build. Overload 2 (`(event: E) => void`) absorbs every callback,
 * because any return type is assignable to a void-returning signature — that
 * is what keeps an incidental return from being read as a declared verb
 * result. Reorder the overloads, or delete overload 2, and inference starts
 * picking those returns up silently. These assertions fail if that happens.
