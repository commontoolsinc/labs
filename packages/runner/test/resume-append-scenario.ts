// Shared, edge-triggered harness for the "update during the resume-await window"
// regression tests (filter/flatMap).
//
// A resumed list builtin's per-element result documents are named by the
// resume pre-sync, so they stream in while `start()` is still pending. The
// window under test is an input update that lands during that stream: the
// first reconcile after the start then runs over warm results and must fold
// the update in. A wall-clock delay on those documents cannot guarantee the
// ordering: on a slow or loaded CI host they can arrive before the update, the
// window never opens, and the test passes vacuously. Instead this harness HOLDS
// the per-element documents in the transport until the test explicitly
// releases them, so the update lands inside the window on every run, and
// asserts the window was genuinely open.

// The per-element run documents are matched specifically: each element's op is a
// projection of `element.<field>`, so its result document carries a link whose
// path starts `["element", ...]`. The container/input sync (which carries the
// input array and the aggregate schema) does not, so it lands while the start is
// pending and the input update can be written and read through the result cell
// inside the window.
