// Server-execution v2 stage G: the outbox — both halves — and the
// stage-D sqlite bound's discharge (serving-loop.md §4–§6; FP1 RULED
// 2026-08-03). The executable spec model
// (packages/spec-model/server-execution) stays the oracle; these tests
// pin the same ruled semantics at the implementation layer:
//
// - effects hand to the outbox POST-commit, never at seal
//   (serving-loop.md §3): a destination that defers takes the sealed
//   tx's post-commit effects, and the inline flush is skipped; a
//   destination without the hook keeps today's inline flush;
// - the EFFECT half is process-local with in-flight dedupe per key
//   (§4/§5): a second admit of a live id attaches, counters count
//   (§7's memo/outbox blocks), and the run-context carriage captured
//   at seal is retrievable until the work settles;
// - the DURABLE half (FP1): outbound append rows land INSIDE the
//   wave's own engine transaction, only for SURVIVING contributions;
//   delivery admits at the target under the delegated row — `firedAt`
//   from the CARRIED actor, the envelope the service session (LT5) —
//   then deletes the row (admit-before-delete, so a crash between the
//   two re-sends and the target's eventId horizon dedupes: the model's
//   C2/FP1 closure — no schedule loses an append); an LT4
//   deterministic rejection deletes without retrying;
// - sqlite ops in HOME wave batches attach their cell-db through the
//   memory server's wave hook and apply atomically with the wave's
//   cell ops; a sink without the hook, a batch without per-op scope
//   keys, and a FOREIGN batch with sqlite ops are all refused loudly.
