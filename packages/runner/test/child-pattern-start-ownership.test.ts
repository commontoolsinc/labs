// narrowed to the run that installed the registration would recover nothing
// here, because the runs that follow install none.

    // `keyless:` patternIdentity in its own setup transaction; the held/

    // the injected rejection cascades through every subsequent run's commits
    // ("pending dependency not resolved"): durable AND local state roll back
