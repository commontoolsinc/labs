// Server-execution v2 stage F: the serving loop end to end, against a
// real memory server, engines, and TWO runtimes — a client session
// (authored commits over the loopback wire) and the SpaceServer's
// serving runtime (the ExecutorHost activates it on the client's session
// open; serving-loop.md §1, §3):
//
// - activation on session open via the admission-side observer (plane
//   (b)), lease acquired and RENEWED on stage B's cadence;
// - an authored client commit wakes the loop; the scheduler runs the
//   affected graph; the action seals into the wave; ONE derived commit
//   lands carrying the wave's writes, the watermark doc write, and
//   `derivedThrough` (protocol.md §4);
// - the client observes the derived value through ordinary push (M4:
//   instance-keyed dirtiness reaches its subscription) and settles via
//   `waitForSettled` — the poll-loop replacement (testing.md §3);
// - the loop's own derived commit returns on the feed and is skipped by
//   class + holder (self-echo, §3): the wave counter stabilizes;
// - a lost lease parks the space after reacquire fails (§2), and an
//   idle space with no live sessions parks per IDLE_PARK_MS (§1).
