# Pattern Learnings

- Avoid sending `undefined` payloads in scenarios; the harness expects an object
  and may attempt DOM style handling when it receives `undefined`.
- Combining `lift` for sanitizing cells with `derive` for status booleans keeps
  no-op validation logic explicit while avoiding extra handler branches.
- Replacing nested patterns works best by snapshotting cell values with `lift`
  or `derive` before instantiating a new recipe instance; the handler can then
  safely rehydrate the clone while keeping reactive views in sync.
- Re-instantiating child recipes from sanitized parameter lists cleanly resets
  defaults and keeps derived manifests accurate; storing the sanitized manifest
  in a cell ensures parent summaries stay in sync after reconfiguration.
- Batched handler updates land cleanly when every mutable cell is sanitized via
  `lift`; `derive` can safely fall back to the sanitized cell to avoid
  re-running custom defaults.
- Building range-style controls benefits from a single helper that clamps values
  and records history, letting both direct value sets and relative nudges share
  consistent percentage calculations.
- Consolidating multiple reactive slices into a derived summary object works
  smoothly when `lift` normalizes each input first and a separate `derive`
  projects string labels for assertions.
