/**
 * Site table: where each space lives. The home space carries a per-user
 * table of `did → host` facts — the v0 of hint-driven space resolution
 * (2026-06-09 federation session: "the smallest possible slice"). The
 * runtime reads it as its live host lookup; writers include the local
 * daemon (syncing its served sources) and link-receipt flows.
 *
 * Entries are HINTS: unverified in v0 (the space's own log is the
 * integrity boundary, not the host). The first hint may replace an
 * unseeded default-host provider, but it cannot replace a seed or an
 * earlier accepted hint.
 *
 * SECURITY (v0, explicit): the table is ordinary home-space data, so
 * ANYTHING with home-space write access — including patterns running
 * there — can steer where an unseeded space is fetched from, including
 * a space already opened provisionally through the default host.
 * That is a deliberate v0 trade (matching "don't even verify in the
 * first month") and the forcing function for audience-binding the
 * session handshake before host hints ever come from less-trusted
 * data.
 *
 * Table semantics: an array with no uniqueness constraint. During initial
 * hydration, the last valid HTTP or HTTPS entry for a DID is the candidate
 * route. A seed or accepted hint remains fixed. A default-host fallback is
 * provisional until the first hint is accepted. Removing an entry does not
 * unregister an accepted route until the runtime restarts.
