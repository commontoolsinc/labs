// Device-link login: `#k=<base64url 32-byte BIP39 entropy>`.
//
// WHY: an identity minted on a desktop had no way to reach a phone or a second
// browser. The interim answer is to hand the identity across as its BIP39
// entropy — the 32 bytes a 24-word phrase encodes — in a URL fragment, scanned
// from a QR with the phone's native camera. The fragment is never sent to a
// server, and 32 bytes fit in a QR where 24 words do not.
//
// This is an INTERIM mechanism, scoped to be deleted when key delegation
// lands. It is confirm-gated on purpose: a credential in a URL is an
// antipattern, and the confirm screen is the only thing standing between a
// user and a link that would sign them in as somebody else.
//
// SECURITY — what the scrub does and does NOT do. It runs synchronously,
// before any await, and removes the secret from the address bar, from what a
// bookmark or a tab-sync would capture, and from the session history entry.
//
// It does NOT erase these, so do not write code that assumes it did:
//   * `performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0].name` keeps the FULL
//     original URL, secret included, for the document's lifetime. There is no
//     API to clear it (`clearResourceTimings()` does not). This matters
//     concretely: `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-document-load` reads that
//     entry and reports it as `http.url`. Wiring document-load instrumentation
//     into this shell would ship the private key to the OTLP collector. It is
//     not wired today — keep it that way, or filter the attribute.
//   * The visit is committed to the browser's persistent history database
//     before any script runs; replaceState amends the session entry, not that.
//   * The secret sits in the address bar from navigation commit until this
//     bundle has been fetched, parsed and evaluated — unbounded, and on a cold
//     mobile load over a VPN, easily seconds.
// These are accepted for an interim flow; they are the reason the payload is
// opaque entropy rather than the words, and the reason pairing is reveal-gated
// on the other end.
//
// `pathname + search` is preserved because the pairing QR targets a deep link —
// after the confirm, the normal boot must continue to that path so the flow
// ends inside a logged-in app the user can bookmark, and the scrubbed URL is
// exactly what gets bookmarked.
