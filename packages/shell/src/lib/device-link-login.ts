// KeyStore BEFORE the app's normal key initialization runs, then let the normal
// boot pick the new identity up. It must NOT route through App.setIdentity or a
// set-identity command — those THROW "Cannot change identity while logged in"
// when a different identity is active, and replacing a stale identity is the
// entire point of this handler.
//
// It also runs at BOOTSTRAP rather than from LoginView, because LoginView never
// mounts when a stale identity auto-logs in — which is exactly the re-pair case.
// A LoginView-only handler would silently no-op there.
//
// TODO(device-link-pwa): pairing does NOT reach an INSTALLED home-screen PWA.
// This flow lands in a Safari tab; iOS partitions storage per-app, so the
// identity written here is invisible to the installed app, AND the manifest's
// `start_url: "/"` means "Add to Home Screen" loses the deep link too — the
// installed app opens logged-out at Register/Login. Confirmed on iPhone,
// iOS 17.5 (2026-07-22). LEFT AS-IS deliberately: nobody uses the installed-PWA
// entry today, and the Safari-tab bookmark works. Fixing it is a product +
// manifest decision (change start_url, or an in-PWA scan/paste path), not a
// tweak here — revisit if the installed PWA becomes a real target.
