// The FUSE daemon runs fuse_session_loop on an FFI thread and answers every
// request on the isolate thread. A reverse invalidation (notify_inval_entry /
// notify_inval_inode) enters the Linux kernel and takes the parent directory's
// inode lock for write; a concurrent lookup under that directory holds the same
// lock for read until the daemon answers it. If a notify ran synchronously on
// the isolate thread it would block there, inside the kernel, behind a lookup
// only that thread can answer — a deadlock that wedges the mount before it
// serves anything. The notify symbols must therefore be nonblocking so they run
// off the isolate thread and leave the request path free.
