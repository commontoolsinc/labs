/**
 * `ActionFunction` is the `action` a PATTERN sees: `commonfabric` resolves to
 * `api/index.ts`, so this type — not `builder/module.ts`'s implementation
 * overloads — is what a pattern type-checks against.
 *
 * The two are maintained by hand and drift silently in one direction that no
 * other test notices: an overload added to the builder but not here is
 * invisible to every pattern, while the builder's own tests keep passing. That
 * is how the result overload was first shipped unreachable — `action<E, R>(…)`
 * in a pattern failed with "Expected 1 type arguments, but got 2" while
 * `packages/runner`'s overload guard was green.
 *
 * These assertions are the pattern-facing half. `packages/runner`'s
 * `action-overload-types.test.ts` covers the builder half; both must hold.
