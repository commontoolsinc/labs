 * identity (and their place in the deep-frozen cache) -- so a subsequent
 * `deepFreeze()` of the result tree short-circuits on every off-spine
 * subtree.
 *
 * Conceptually a copy-on-write descent: starting from the root, at each
 * step the next container along `path` is shallow-thawed (via
 * `cloneIfNecessary(_, { frozen: false, deep: false, force })`) and the
 * shallow clone is spliced into its (already-mutable) parent. The result
 * `pathValue` is the mutable container at the end of `path`.
 *
 * ### Mutation patterns supported via the returned `pathValue`
 *
 * - Object property add / set / delete: `pathValue.k = v`, `delete pathValue.k`.
 * - Array set-element / push / splice / length: `pathValue[i] = v`,
 *   `pathValue.push(v)`, `pathValue.splice(i, n, ...add)`, `pathValue.length = n`.
 * - "Replace the value at some slot": pass the parent's path as `path`,
 *   then assign through `pathValue[lastKey] = newValue`.
 *
 * ### Path semantics
 *
 * `path` is an array of pre-parsed segments (JSON-Pointer-style, but already
 * unescaped and split). Each segment is a property name for objects or an
 * array-index string for arrays. The helper descends through plain JS
 * objects and arrays; it does NOT descend into `FabricInstance` values
 * (those don't expose path-style member access in the current data model).
 * A `FabricInstance` is permitted as the final value at `path`, in which
 * case it's shallow-thawed via its own `shallowClone(false)` interface.
 *
 * ### Missing path segments
 *
 * By default (`createMissing: false`), missing segments throw a
 * `CloneForMutationError` with kind `"missing-segment"`. With
 * `createMissing: true`, the helper allocates fresh containers as it
 * descends through missing slots; see {@link CloneForMutationOptions} for
 * the shape-selection rules (in particular the `nextKeyAfterPath` hint).
 *
 * ### Errors
 *
 * Throws a `CloneForMutationError` (see {@link CloneForMutationErrorKind})
 * for unsuitable inputs or paths. Other unexpected errors (e.g. cycles in
 * the spine surfaced by the underlying `cloneIfNecessary` machinery)
 * propagate as plain `Error`s.
 *
 * @param value - The input value tree.
 * @param path - Path to the container (or `FabricInstance`) to expose as
 *   mutable.
 * @param options - See `CloneForMutationOptions`.
