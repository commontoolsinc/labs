/**
 * The narrowings that ask a shape question of a value already typed as a
 * `FabricValue`, and the container questions a structural walk asks of an
 * `unknown`. Whether a value belongs to the `FabricValue` type at all is
 * `validity-check.ts`'s question, and none of these asks it.
 *
 * The narrowings are looser than membership on purpose. Most are asked of a
 * value whose type already claims to be a `FabricValue`, and answer only
 * whether it may be read by name; where one accepts something membership
 * refuses, the difference is stated on that narrowing rather than here.
 *
 * The `isKeyable*` and `isWalkable*` pairs are the exception on both counts.
 * They take `unknown`, because a structural walk holds whatever its caller
 * passed -- a schema node, a pattern binding, a builder artifact -- and asking
 * it to prove membership first would be asking a different question than the
 * one it needs answered. Outside the `FabricValue` type they subtract nothing:
 * a `Date`, a `Map`, a `Cell` and a query-result proxy over one all still
 * return `true`, which is what leaves a walk's treatment of them where it
 * found it. Inside the type, a `FabricPrimitive` and any other special object
 * that is not a `FabricInstance` returns `false`, having no own properties to
 * read.
 *
 * The four differ on a `FabricInstance`, and nowhere else. `isKeyable*`
 * returns `false` for one, reporting that the asking walk cannot reach what it
 * holds; `isWalkable*` refuses one, for a walk that would carry a `false`
 * forward as an empty record. Each pair settles the array question in its
 * name.

/**
 * Indicates whether a value's contents are reachable by property name: a
 * non-`null` object, an array included, that is not a `FabricSpecialObject`.
 *
 * This is the container question, and the question `isObjectOrArray()` gets
 * wrong. A special object keeps its state in private fields and has no own
 * properties at all, so `isObjectOrArray()` calls it a record and a walk then
 * works on an empty one: it merges to `{}`, compares vacuously equal, descends
 * and finds nothing, or grafts a property onto a frozen value. A `false`
 * result says the value has no keys to reach, which is the whole story for a
 * `FabricPrimitive` and any further subclass, and for a class extending
 * `FabricSpecialObject` directly.
 *
 * A `FabricInstance` returns `false` here as well, and that answer is
 * incomplete rather than wrong: an instance holds other `FabricValue`s, so a
 * path below one addresses something that exists and this reports it as
 * unreachable. Reach for this where that is the honest thing to report, and
 * record what it under-reports where the report lands -- a walk that decides
 * what a path finds, or what a change triggers, is reporting an absence rather
 * than handing back a wrong value. Reach for {@link isWalkableObjectOrArray}
 * instead where a `false` would make the walk hand back a wrong value rather
 * than report an absence; that one refuses an instance for exactly that
 * reason. The two differ on an instance and nowhere else.
 *
 * TODO(danfuzz): descend a `FabricInstance` by its codec contents, at which
 * point this returns `true` and a path below one stops reading as absent.
 *
 * `isFabricPlainContainer()` asks the container question of a value the type
 * system already says is a `FabricValue`; this takes `unknown`, which is what
 * a structural walk holds, and so still admits a `Date`, a `Map`, a `Cell` and
 * a query-result proxy over one.
 *
 * Like its `utils` counterparts, the name settles the array question, and the
 * sibling {@link isKeyableObjectNotArray} is the same test with arrays
 * removed. This is a structural predicate, so it narrows in one direction only
 * and is overloaded accordingly; see the header of `@commonfabric/utils/types`
 * for what that means. The narrowed type is read-only, these callers only
 * reading what they narrow.

 *
 * This is the question a structural walk asks before it reads, rebuilds,
 * merges, or descends a value by its keys, and it differs from its sibling on
 * exactly the value where a `false` would be a claim rather than a report. An
 * instance is a container a walk is meant to descend, so a walk that takes
 * `false` for an answer carries it forward as an empty record and loses what
 * it holds. "Not yet" is not a boolean, and the refusal is what carries it.
 *

 * own marker records that, wants {@link isKeyableObjectOrArray} instead. So
 * does a walk running where a throw cannot be delivered -- under a storage
 * subscription that has to keep delivering, say.
 *
 * The refusal is the one every other walk in the tree raises; "Flag-gated
 * tripwires" in `docs/development/EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS.md` governs them all.
 * Its strength here is de facto rather than by construction: no flag stands
 * between an instance and this predicate, and a `FabricError` is ungated and
 * exposed to pattern authors, so nothing but the absence of such a call keeps
 * it from firing.
 *
 * `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT.md` under "Walking or comparing a value" says
 * which of the four a walk reaches for, including where a caller with a better
 * answer than a throw tests for an instance ahead of this one.
 *
 * The walk-side half of admitting special objects is
 * {@link isKeyableObjectOrArray} and this disposition toward an instance; the
 * compare-side half is `fabricAwareEqual()`.
