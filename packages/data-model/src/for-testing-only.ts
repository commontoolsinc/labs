/**
 * What this package offers to tests alone: examples of every concrete
 * `FabricPrimitive` and `FabricInstance` class, for a test that ranges over
 * the classes to take its values from, so that it holds no table of its own
 * to fall out of step. Each table's type is what holds it complete: a class
 * with no entry, or an entry of some other class, stops this module compiling.
 *
 * The examples of a class are written once, as makers. Every table of makers
 * here keeps one contract, which a test may rest on:
 *
 * - Each call of a maker returns a new object.
 * - Every object one maker returns is equal to every other it returns, so two
 *   calls give an equal-but-distinct pair.
 * - No object one maker returns is equal to one another maker of that class
 *   returns, and every class has at least two makers, so a class's first two
 *   makers give a pair that differs.
 *
 * This has its own entry in the package's export map and no place in any
 * barrel, so that loading the classes constructs none of it.
