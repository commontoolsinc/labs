 * Deep-frozen container pairing a `JSONSchema` with its content hash.

 * form and that the hash is computed once.
 *
 * To create instances, use `internSchema()` from `schema-hash.ts` —
 * it handles freezing, hashing, and caching. The constructor is public
 * for direct use when both the frozen schema and hash are already in hand.
 *
 * This class accepts `undefined` as its "schema" upon construction as a
 * concession to making the schema intern mechanism work straightforwardly with
 * `undefined`. However, in nearly every client use having `undefined` be a
 * possible value for `.schema` is undesirable, so that accessor `throw`s
 * instead of returning `undefined`. For the few cases where `undefined` is
 * acceptable, there is `.schemaOrUndefined`.
