 * includes an "ASCII ellipsis" of `...`. When `options` asks for it, the result
 * is then quoted as a Markdown code span, ready to splice into message text.
 *
 * The value is first converted with `toStructuredDebugValue()`, passing along
 * the depth limit and replacer given in `options`, and it is that result which
 * gets rendered. This function handles:
 * * all normal JSON-compatible values.
 * * other JavaScript primitive values:
 *   * bigints.
 *   * symbols, both interned and uninterned.
 *   * non-finite numbers.
 *   * `-0`.
 * * functions.
 * * `FabricInstance`s and `FabricPrimitive`s.
 * * instances of other classes.
 * * objects and arrays with circular references.
 * * arrays with holes.
 *
 * The rendering stops at the nesting depth given in `options`, ten levels
 * when not given, below which a value is elided. It likewise stops at the
 * array length given in `options`, one hundred elements when not given, and
 * says the array's actual length in place of the elements past it; likewise
 * at the property count given in `options`, one hundred when not given, and
 * says the object's actual count in place of the properties past it; and a
 * string longer than the string length given in `options`, two hundred
 * characters when not given, renders as an excerpt of that length followed by
 * the string's actual length. A buffer within a `FabricPrimitive` with more
 * bytes than the buffer length given in `options`, two hundred when not given,
 * renders that many bytes followed by the buffer's actual length.
 *
 * How any of these renders is _not_ a contract. The rendering is meant for a
 * human reading a diagnostic, and it changes as that reading is improved;
 * nothing but a test should depend on its details.
 *
 * If the rendering could not be completed, this function returns the literal
 * string `"<unrenderable debug string>"`.
 *
 * **Note:** In _many_ cases, the output of this function is valid JSON text,
 * but not _all_ cases. This function must _not_ be relied on to produce a
 * parseable string.
