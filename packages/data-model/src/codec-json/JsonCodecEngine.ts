/**
 * Whole-value JSON codec implementing the `/<Type>@<Version>` wire format from
 * the formal spec (Section 5).
 *
 * Public instance surface, one boundary type and two directions:
 * - `encode(value, env?)` -- full pipeline: tree-encode + stringify
 * - `decode(data, env)` -- full pipeline: parse + tree-decode
 *
 * The machinery beneath belongs elsewhere. The walks and this format's account
 * of how a container is written down are `JsonEncodeAct`'s and
 * `JsonDecodeAct`'s, which this class mints through the two `protected`
 * factories -- that pair being the surface a second engine extends. What both
 * an engine and an act need of the wire text is in `wire-text.ts`, so that
 * neither imports the other. Per-type encoding and decoding is delegated to
 * the `FabricCodec`s in the `CodecRegistry`.
 *
 * Three statics are public besides: `seemsLikeEncoded()`, and the
 * `wrapEncodedValueForTesting()` / `unwrapEncodedValueForTesting()` pair
 * that lets a test build and take apart this format's tagged form without
 * reaching into the private wrapper.
 *
 * **Cycles are refused** and **shared references are flattened**, per Section
 * 1.6 of the formal spec, which requires an engine to say which of these it
 * does. Both follow from reaching text: JSON cannot represent a reference,
 * so a cycle has no encoding at all and is raised at the walk, and a value
 * held at two positions is written out twice, arriving as two objects that a
 * receiver cannot tell from two that were always distinct.

   * store it in a fixture file, to compare it against a literal. Doing that by
   * hand means writing the prefix a second time, which is how one definition of
   * a format quietly becomes several that can drift apart.
   *
   * This is deliberately not useful outside a test. Its result is precisely a
   * string that is _no longer_ an encoded fabric value: it has shed the very
   * marker whose purpose is to say "this JSON came from here." Production code
   * that wants to recognize an encoded value should call `seemsLikeEncoded()`;
   * production code that wants the value itself should call `decode()`.
   *
   * That is enforced rather than merely advised: by default this performs a
   * throwaway decode of `encoded` and throws if it is not genuinely decodable.
   * So it cannot serve as a cheap "chop off the first few characters," and it
   * is far too expensive to belong on any hot path.
   *
   * Pass `isMalformed` when the payload is bad on purpose. The decode is then
   * skipped entirely -- malformed means malformed, and deliberately broken text
   * cannot be asked to survive a decode. Only the prefix check remains.
   *
   * The tag itself is still required either way. That is not a judgment about
   * the payload: removing a prefix that is not there does not produce the body,
   * it produces nonsense, so there is nothing for this to return.
   *
   * `registry` decides what the check is able to read, and so what counts as
   * decodable. It defaults to the format-only registry described above, under
   * which any tag is acceptable; pass one carrying a class roster to hold the
   * payload to that roster's codecs as well.
