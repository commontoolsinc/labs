/**
 * The boundary between native JS values and `FabricValue`s, in both
 * directions, along with the predicate saying in advance whether a value can
 * cross it.
 *
 * Inbound, anything not representable is refused rather than approximated: a
 * `Map`, a class instance, an unrecognized type all throw, on the principle
 * that a wrong value is worse than none. A value that is already a deep-frozen
 * `FabricValue` crosses by identity instead of being rebuilt, and a cycle is
 * detected rather than followed.
 *
 * The inbound work splits along one question -- does conversion produce a new
 * value? -- so that a caller can ask it without having to work the answer back
 * out of what it was handed. Minting a native object's fabric form is one
 * function, vetting a value that needs no minting is the other, and the
 * shallow conversion is the two asked in that order plus a frozenness
 * adjustment.
 *
 * Outbound, a wrapper is unwrapped to the native type it stands for, while a
 * `FabricInstance` with no native counterpart passes through untouched. The
 * full conversion in each direction takes the result's freeze state as an
 * argument; on the way out, a class defined to be always frozen comes back
 * frozen regardless of what was asked for.
