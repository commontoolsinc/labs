/**
 * Whole-value codec engine for the realm-crossing wire format: the form a
 * `FabricValue` takes when it is handed to `structuredClone()` or
 * `postMessage()` to reach another realm.
 *
 * The format is specified by `4-realm-encoding.md` of the formal spec, which
 * is the authority on the shape of an encoded value, the marker and its rules,
 * what the walks refuse, and what each direction does with the memory it is
 * given. Two of its terms are worth naming here because they are what the
 * methods below are written in: the **outer envelope** is the two-element
 * `[marker, tree]` that crosses, and a **tagged form** is the three-element
 * `[marker, tag, state]` that a codec's output wears inside it.
 *
 * The marker answers both of the questions `BaseCodecEngine.encode()` frames.
 * Which parts of a payload are the format's own: identity settles that, where
 * JSON escapes instead, and it is the question a private channel does not
 * excuse. And what wrote this: the marker carries a version, and `decode()`
 * refuses one it does not implement.
 *
 * **Cycles are refused and a shared reference survives exactly where nothing
 * beneath it needed encoding**, per Section 1.6 of the formal spec, which
 * requires an engine to say which of these it does. Section 4 of the realm
 * spec gives both, and the encode and decode sides of the ownership contract
 * are Section 5 -- the half a caller is likeliest to get wrong being that an
 * encoded tree shares structure with the value it came from and is not frozen.
 *
 * TODO(danfuzz): A memo from each visited object to its encoded counterpart
 * closes cycles and sharing at once: a repeat visit yields the node already
 * built for it, which preserves sharing through a rebuild and lets a back-edge
 * resolve instead of recursing. It belongs on `BaseEncodeAct` and `BaseDecodeAct`,
 * beside the in-progress set, since a cycle can run through
 * a codec-matched object as readily as through a container and both walks
 * need it.
