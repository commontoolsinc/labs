/**
 * Creates a registry holding this format's determination about JavaScript's
 * primitive types, and nothing else. It registers no fabric class, so a
 * registry from here encodes no `FabricSpecialObject` and decodes every fabric
 * wire tag to an `UnknownValue`; registering the classes that participate is a
 * caller's job.
 *
 * Where JSON has to tag four of the seven primitive types, this format tags
 * one. Structured cloning carries `bigint`, `undefined`, and the special
 * numbers (`-0`, `NaN`, `±Infinity`) as themselves, so each of those is
 * self-representing here; only `symbol` needs an encoding, cloning having
 * refused it.
 *
 * `number` is therefore registered one way rather than JSON's two: there is no
 * special-number codec to try first, the whole of the type being its own wire
 * form.
 *
 * The result is frozen, so add classes with `CodecRegistry.extend()` rather
 * than by registering onto it.
