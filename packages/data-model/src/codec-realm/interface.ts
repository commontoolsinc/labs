/**
 * The transport form of this format: a value that structured cloning carries
 * across a realm boundary without loss, and so what `RealmCodecEngine.encode()`
 * returns and `decode()` accepts.
 *
 * Unlike JSON's `JsonCodecValue`, this is not an intermediate tree awaiting a
 * further reduction to what actually crosses. Cloning takes this shape
 * directly, so the tree _is_ the wire, and the engine's `Encoded` and
 * `SerializedForm` are the same type.
 *
 * The union names what this format emits, which is narrower than everything
 * cloning accepts. Four arms are worth calling out:
 *
 * * `bigint` and `undefined` appear directly, as do `-0`, `NaN` and
 *   `±Infinity` under `number`. Cloning carries each as itself.
 * * `ArrayBuffer` appears, because bytes cross as bytes. This is the whole
 *   point of a second format: JSON has to represent a `FabricBytes` as
 *   base64url text, and a receiver that wants bytes back has to rebuild them.
 *   The two forms are not interchangeable. Bytes travel as a bare
 *   `ArrayBuffer` rather than as a view onto one, that being what
 *   `postMessage()` can *transfer*, so a caller assembling a transfer list
 *   finds the transferable object in the tree rather than having to reach
 *   through a view and reason about its offset. Both byte-carrying classes do
 *   this: a `FabricBytes` encodes to one directly, and a `FabricHash` to one
 *   beside its algorithm tag. A bare `Uint8Array` is therefore not a form this
 *   format emits, and `decodeValue()` refuses one.
 * * An array is both the tagged form and the outer envelope -- see
 *   {@link RealmTaggedValue} and {@link RealmEncodedValue}. Neither is
 *   distinguishable by shape from a payload's own arrays, and neither is meant
 *   to be: what marks them is the identity of the object in slot zero, which
 *   {@link RealmFormatMarker} explains.
 *
 * `symbol` is absent: cloning refuses one outright, so this format registers
 * the shared `SymbolCodec` and a symbol crosses under a tag like any other
 * value a transport cannot carry directly.

/**
 * The object whose identity marks this format's outer envelope and its tagged
 * forms.
 *
 * `RealmCodecEngine.encode()` mints one per call and puts it in slot zero of
 * the outer envelope and of every tagged form beneath it. A receiver takes it
 * from the outer envelope and recognizes the rest by `===` against it.
 *
 * That works because structured cloning preserves shared references: one
 * object referenced from many positions arrives as one object referenced from
 * many positions. It is the only property of the transport this format leans
 * on beyond carrying its types, and it is the whole of what makes either form
 * unmistakable.
 *
 * **It must be an object.** Recognition is `===`, which on a primitive is
 * value equality rather than identity, so a primitive in slot zero would be
 * reproducible by any payload that happened to hold the same one --
 * and the argument below would evaporate. `decode()` refuses an outer envelope
 * whose slot zero is not a one-element array holding this version, which is
 * that requirement and the version check at once.
 *
 * **A payload cannot contain the marker**, and two facts together are what
 * say so.
 *
 * It is *younger than the value*: created after the value exists, so nothing
 * already assembled can hold a reference to it, whatever its author has seen
 * of some earlier encoding. That is why it is minted per call rather than per
 * engine -- a long-lived one could be embedded in a value by code that had
 * legitimately seen an earlier encoded tree, and the walk would carry it
 * through to a data position where the decoder would read it as a tagged form.
 *
 * And it is *confined*: it never leaves the engine until `encode()` returns.
 * It lives in a private field and in the tagged forms the walk is building,
 * neither of which anything outside can reach, and a nested `encode()` mints
 * and retires its own. Age alone would not settle it, because a value's
 * contents need not all exist when the walk starts -- a getter runs mid-walk,
 * after the marker exists. What closes that gap is that such a getter has
 * nowhere to read the marker from.
 *
 * It is a frozen array of one string, which is also a `FabricValue` this
 * format encodes by identity. That matters: a value holding some *earlier*
 * call's marker has to encode without complaint, being ordinary data, and a
 * marker shaped as something the walk refuses would make such a value
 * unencodable.
 *
 * It is not a secret and not an authentication token. Whatever asks for an
 * encoding is trusted with the result, and whatever receives a payload is
 * trusted to read it; a hostile peer builds its own marker and forges freely,
 * exactly as it could send any tagged value it liked. What the marker rules
 * out is *confusion within a payload this engine encoded* -- which is the
 * escaping problem, and the whole of what it is for.
