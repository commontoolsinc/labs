/**
 * Compares two values of unknown type for logical equality, the way
 * `deepEqual()` does, with every `FabricSpecialObject` the walk reaches
 * decided by `valueEqual()` rather than by its properties.
 *
 * This is the comparison for an operand allowed to hold a `FabricValue`
 * without being known to be one: a schema `const` against a stored value, a
 * schema default against a materialized one, a write against the value it
 * replaces, a request against the snapshot a policy was checked over. A
 * special object -- a byte sequence, a temporal value, a content hash, a
 * regular expression, an error, a link, a map, a set -- keeps its state in
 * private fields and has no enumerable own properties, so `deepEqual()` on its
 * own reads two distinct same-class ones as equal. `valueEqual()` is defined
 * over `FabricValue`s and throws on any other class instance, which these
 * operands still carry -- a `Cell`, a query-result proxy.
 *
 * Operands arrive unwrapped. A special object is recognized by `instanceof`,
 * which a proxy decides rather than the value behind it, so a proxy that does
 * not forward the test hides the special object from this comparison and two
 * distinct ones read as equal -- the answer this function exists to prevent.
 * One that does forward it reaches `valueEqual()`, which reads a private field
 * through the proxy and throws. `data-model` sits below whatever built the
 * proxy and cannot unwrap one, so this is the caller's to do.
 *
 * So the walk is the frame, and the model decides the values only it can
 * decide. A special object is one of those, whatever it sits inside: two of
 * one class are compared by content hash, and one paired with anything else is
 * unequal.
 *
 * The model is not asked about a container. `valueEqual()` decides a record or
 * an array by hashing it whole, and `hashStringOf()` refuses two kinds of
 * value the `FabricValue` type admits: one holding a cycle, which the hash
 * walk has no tracking for and exhausts the stack on, and one holding a class
 * whose codec is still a stub. Both return here where the walk finds what
 * settles them before descending that far. Comparing `{ v: aFabricMap }`
 * against `{ v: 5 }` returns `false`, on the ground that a `FabricMap` is not
 * `5`; a cycle the two operands reach at one shared reference stops at that
 * reference. This walk carries no cycle tracking of its own, so two separate
 * cyclic graphs exhaust the stack here as well.
 *
 * TODO(danfuzz): decide a container through the model as well, once
 * `hashStringOf()` tracks cycles and the stub codecs are written, at which
 * point this becomes a hash comparison with the walk beneath it rather than
 * the other way round. The order costs rather than decides: `valueEqual()`
 * compares deep-frozen operands by a content hash cached on identity, where
 * the walk pays for every level each time.
 *
 * A pair of one class that class cannot yet hash still throws, from
 * `valueEqual()`. `FabricMap` and `FabricSet` carry stub codecs, and a stub
 * naming itself is the answer that names the work.
 *
 * Where both this and `valueEqual()` return, they return the same answer but
 * for one value: a null-prototype object holding the same contents as a plain
 * record. `valueEqual()` calls the two equal, a record being a record in the
 * value model. This walk separates them on their constructors.
 *
 * This is the compare-side half of admitting special objects; the walk-side
 * half is `isKeyableObjectOrArray()`, with `isWalkableObjectOrArray()` the
 * same question for a walk that must refuse a `FabricInstance` rather than
 * report one as unreachable.
