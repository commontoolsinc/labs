/**
 * Container for a value whose deconstruction or reconstruction failed.
 * Preserves the tag and raw state at fault, for round-tripping and debugging.
 * Used in lenient mode to allow graceful degradation rather than hard
 * failures. See Section 3.5 of the formal spec.
 *
 * Both of the things it preserves are whatever was at fault, which is why the
 * constructor takes anything at all for either: the one thing this class must
 * not do is fail while reporting a failure. What can be kept is kept exactly,
 * and anything else is replaced by a debug rendering of itself --
 * `toReportableState()` for the state, `toReportableTag()` for the tag.
 *
 * A rendering is deliberately not a conversion. A `Uint8Array` could be turned
 * into a `FabricBytes` and a `RegExp` into a `FabricRegExp`, and doing so
 * would misreport the wire: a reader would find a `FabricBytes` in `state` and
 * conclude the payload carried one, when it carried raw bytes this format does
 * not accept. A string plainly reads as a description of the value rather than
 * the value, which is the honest answer where fidelity is not available.
 *
 * **This class encodes under a tag of its own**, `Problematic@1`, and carries
 * the preserved tag as data beside the state and the error. `UnknownValue`
 * does the opposite, round-tripping to the tag it preserved -- and can,
 * because that tag is a real tag. Here the preserved tag need not be one:
 * reporting a malformed tag is among the things this class is for, and a value
 * whose whole content is "this tag was not a tag" cannot go back out under
 * that tag. Encoding under a fixed tag keeps the wire form decodable whatever
 * was preserved, and keeps it a single shape rather than one shape per kind of
 * fault.
