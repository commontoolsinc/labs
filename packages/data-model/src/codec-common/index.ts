/**
 * This directory holds the codec system's active machinery: the registry that
 * indexes codecs, the lookup that finds a class's codec, the engine base, the
 * per-act contexts, and the two classes a fault produces. It is also the
 * package's public face for the codec system as a whole, re-exporting the
 * declarations in `codec-interface/` so that an outside caller has one entry
 * point rather than two.
 *
 * That convenience is for this barrel alone. A module inside the package
 * imports the file it wants directly -- nothing here imports this barrel --
 * which is what keeps a module that only needs to name a codec from pulling
 * the machinery in behind it, and is the point of the two directories.
 *
 * Everything here is format-agnostic. Nothing in this directory knows which
 * wire format is in play, and a codec that exists because one particular
 * format cannot carry some type belongs with that format instead:
 * `codec-json/` holds the four that JSON needs.
 *
 * The one abstract base here is `BaseCodecEngine`, what an ENGINE extends, one
 * per wire format -- the thing that walks fabric values and drives their
 * codecs. What such a value itself extends is a different question with a
 * different answer, and lives in `fabric-bases/`.
 *
 * Besides it, the classes here are `UnknownValue` and `ProblematicValue`,
 * which exist only because a decode found a tag no codec claimed or went
 * wrong outright. A class a caller models data with belongs in `fabric-instances/`
 * or `fabric-primitives/` instead.
