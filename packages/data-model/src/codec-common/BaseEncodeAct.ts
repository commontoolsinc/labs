/**
 * One act of encoding: what {@link BaseCodecAct} holds, the walk that turns a
 * `FabricValue` into this format's transport tree, and the format's own account
 * of how a container is written down.
 *
 * An engine mints one of these per `encode()` call, through a factory its
 * subclass supplies. What a format supplies is a subclass of this, which is
 * where the two type parameters land: `Encoded` is the transport tree the walk
 * and the codecs work in, and `SerializedForm` is what crosses the format's
 * public boundary. They differ where a format reduces its tree by a further
 * step -- JSON stringifies -- and a format whose tree is what crosses leaves
 * the second to default to the first.
 *
 * The division is between what a format decides and what it must not. This
 * class settles the second: a self-representing value is emitted as it stands,
 * a value matching no codec is either a container or an error, a terminal
 * codec's state is final where a nonterminal one's is walked again, and a tag
 * comes from `tagForValue()` rather than from the value. None of those is a
 * property of a wire format, and every one is a decision a walk could quietly
 * get wrong: a state expanded when it should have been passed through, or the
 * reverse, surfaces far from the dispatch that decided it, and where a state
 * is a record of strings the two choices emit byte-identical output.
 *
 * What a subclass owns is everything about containers, and that is where a
 * format is entitled to differ: whether keys are ordered, whether a key can
 * collide with the tag form and so needs escaping, and how an absent array
 * index is written down. A format that answers those differently is not
 * varying an implementation detail; it is being a different format.
