/**
 * Codec for registry-interned symbols, for any format whose encoded type
 * admits a `string`. Encodes the registry key; decodes with `Symbol.for()`.
 *
 * It is generic over the encoded type and lives beside the shared machinery
 * because nothing about it is any one format's business. A symbol's portable
 * content is its registry key, which is a string in every format that has
 * strings, so both the encoding and its refusals are the same wherever it is
 * registered.
 *
 * A format supplies `keyAsEncoded` rather than this class casting a `string`
 * into `Encoded`. That is the one step a type parameter cannot justify from
 * inside -- TypeScript will not prove a `string` assignable to a bare
 * parameter, and no `extends` clause can even exclude the parameter being
 * `never`, `never` being assignable to everything. Handed in from the outside
 * it is checked where it is provable, and a format with no `string` arm cannot
 * supply it.
 *
 * That same fact is why this codec's state type is `Encoded & string` rather
 * than plain `string`. The state type is bounded by `Encoded`, which a bare
 * `string` cannot be shown to satisfy; the intersection is the only spelling
 * that is both a string and provably in the format's domain.
 *
 * **What crosses is internedness**, and that is the whole of the promise: a
 * decoded symbol is interned under the key the encoded one was interned under,
 * which is as interned as a symbol on the far side can be. Whether it is the
 * *same* symbol is a fact about how the two sides are related rather than
 * about this codec: `Symbol.for()` reaches one registry per agent, so two
 * realms sharing an agent agree and a dedicated worker does not, and neither
 * arrangement is something an encoding can promise.
 *
 * Unique symbols (`Symbol(desc)`, where `Symbol.keyFor()` returns `undefined`)
 * have no portable representation -- there is no key to carry -- so
 * `canEncode()` returns `false` for them, which routes them to the registry's
 * "unhandled value" path instead of coercing one into a registry symbol
 * wearing its description.
 *
 * `Symbol` is a non-`new`-able pseudo-constructor, so it is cast to
 * `Constructor` (a "white lie") to seed the class fast-path; `canEncode()`
 * confirms via `typeof`.

   *   The result is `Encoded & string` rather than `Encoded`, so that what is
   *   handed back is still a string. `canDecode()` accepts only a string, and
