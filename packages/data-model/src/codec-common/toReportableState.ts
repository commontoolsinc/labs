/**
 * Converts a state of any type at all into one that can be reported: a
 * `FabricValue` is returned as it stands, and anything else is replaced by a
 * debug rendering of itself.
 *
 * Reporting a failure must not itself fail, and a wire format's encoded states
 * need not be `FabricValue`s -- a realm-crossing format carries `ArrayBuffer`,
 * `RegExp` and `Map` natively. Carrying one of those unaltered would not
 * merely mistype it: a reported state gets deep-frozen, and `Object.freeze()`
 * throws outright on a typed array with elements.
 *
 * **A rendering is deliberately not a conversion**, though one is available.
 * `fabricFromNativeValue()` would turn a `Uint8Array` into a `FabricBytes` and
 * a `RegExp` into a `FabricRegExp`, and doing so would misreport the wire: a
 * reader would find a `FabricBytes` and conclude the payload carried one, when
 * it carried raw bytes the format does not accept. A string plainly reads as a
 * description of a value rather than the value, which is the honest answer
 * where fidelity is not on offer.
 *
 * The membership check runs guarded, so that a defect in it cannot take this
 * function down with it. That is prophylaxis against an unanticipated bug in
 * `isFabricValue()` rather than a guard against any particular input: this
 * runs on the failure path, where throwing does not surface a second problem
 * so much as replace the first one, the original error being lost in favor of
 * whatever the predicate did. `toCompactDebugString()` needs no such wrapping,
 * already returning `"<unrenderable debug string>"` for anything it cannot
 * render, and is the floor this rests on.
 *
 * @param state - The state at fault, of any type whatsoever.
 * @returns `state` itself, or a rendering of it.
