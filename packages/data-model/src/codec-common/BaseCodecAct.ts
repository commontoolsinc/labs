 * What one act of encoding or decoding holds, whether it encodes or decodes:

 * caller supplied, and the values whose walk is in progress.
 *
 * An engine mints one of these per call to a public entry point, through a
 * factory its subclass supplies. Per call rather than per engine, because an
 * engine may be re-entered: a codec can reach back through a public entry
 * point while a walk is already running, and state held on the engine would
 * be shared between the two.
 *
 * The environment is held here rather than threaded beside the act through
 * every walk method, because every such method needs both. An engine whose
 * caller named no environment passes the null one, which fails by name when
 * asked for a cell.
 *
 * What each subclass adds is its own discipline for entering a value, the
 * two differing in what a repeat visit means. See {@link #tryEnter}.
