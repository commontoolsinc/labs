 * bound to `altCodec` when there is none.
 *
 * A class whose codec terminates binds one per wire format, under that
 * format's own symbol, rather than a single `[CODEC]`. Name that symbol as
 * `altCodec` to reach it; a caller wanting the JSON codec passes
 * `[JSON_CODEC]`, and says so a second time by naming that format's value type
 * as `Encoded`. Absent both symbols, this throws.
 *
 * The alternative arrives as a parameter rather than being known here, which
 * is what keeps this module from naming any wire format.
 *
 * The result is of either kind, since `[CODEC]` still wins when a class
 * happens to bind both, and nothing here distinguishes them. That suits the
 * callers, which want a tag: `tagForValue()` is common to both kinds. A caller
 * that means to encode has to read the kind off the codec's class first.
 *
 * @param value The value whose class's codec is wanted.
 * @param altCodec Symbol to try when `[CODEC]` is absent.
