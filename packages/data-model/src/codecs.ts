 * This sits above `codec-json`, `codec-realm` and `codec-common`, which carry
 * the formats and the mechanism and know nothing about which classes
 * participate. Nothing in those directories may import from here; the
 * dependency runs one way, and a convenience import in the other direction
 * would make it a cycle.

 * Both class rosters are imported at module scope and the registry is built at

 * other half of why the rule above is absolute rather than stylistic.
