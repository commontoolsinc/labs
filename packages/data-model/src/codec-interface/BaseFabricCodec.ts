/**
 * Base class for `FabricCodec` which provides commonly-needed functionality:
 * the matching members, and a `tagForValue()` that returns the codec's one
 * recognized tag.
 *
 * It is abstract in `encode()`, `canDecode()` and `decode()` and, deliberately,
 * in identity: extend {@link BaseNonterminalCodec} or {@link BaseTerminalCodec}
 * rather than this directly. Those two are what tell the codec system whether a
 * state is more work for the walker or the walker's final answer, a difference
 * no signature can carry -- and extending one of them fixes the `Encoded`
 * domain in the same stroke, so the declaration and its consequence cannot
 * drift apart.
 *
 * `State` is the codec's own state type, a subtype of the format-wide
 * `Encoded`: what `encode()` emits, what `canDecode()` narrows to, and the only
 * thing `decode()` is handed. Declaring it is how a subclass writes down what
 * it works over, and one declaration serving all three members is what says the
 * three agree. A codec that genuinely works over the whole of `Encoded` leaves
 * it at the default.
 *
 * `decode()` taking `State` rests on the walker asking {@link #canDecode} of
 * every state before dispatching one here, which is what makes the narrower
 * parameter true rather than merely declared.
