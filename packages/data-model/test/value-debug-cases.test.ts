/**
 * The debug renderers, run over the cases recorded as files in
 * `value-debug-cases/`. A file opens with a JavaScript expression which
 * produces a plain object, each of whose properties is one case: the key labels
 * it, and the value is what gets rendered, on its own. The one property that is
 * not a case is `/options`, which holds the options every case in the file is
 * rendered with; a file that binds none renders its cases with the defaults.
 * The expression may run to any number of lines, blank ones included. A line
 * holding nothing but `--`, with a blank line above it and another below,
 * divides the expression from what follows: one section per case, the sections
 * separated by blank lines, each being the label followed by a colon on a line
 * of its own, then three renderings of the value, each starting on a line of
 * its own. The first is its `toCompactDebugString()` rendering, whole. The
 * second is its `toIndentedDebugString()` rendering, which can run to several
 * lines. The third is its `toStructuredDebugValue()` result, the structure the
 * two strings were rendered from, rendered by `toIndentedDebugString()` with
 * every limit at `Infinity` so that it shows whole; where a string rendering
 * interprets a form of the structured value, this rendering shows the form
 * itself. The file's options reach all three calls, and the two that only the
 * compact rendering reads, `maxLength` and `backtickQuote`, therefore reach the
 * compact rendering alone. A recorded rendering is a fact about the renderer,
 * to be read as such when it changes. What `maxLength` does to a compact
 * rendering is `value-debug.test.ts`'s to check, so no case here is cut by one.
 *
 * The expression is evaluated with every `FabricInstance` and
 * `FabricPrimitive` class in scope under its own name, along with the three
 * abstract base classes and the realm codec's binding symbol, so that a case
 * can define a class of its own; nothing else beyond the language is in
 * scope.
 *
 * To rewrite each file's recorded renderings from the actual ones, run this
 * from the package directory:
 *
 * ```
 * UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env \
 *   test/value-debug-cases.test.ts
 * ```
