/**
 * The primitive base class's own behavior, which comes down to one invariant.
 *
 * Every concrete primitive is required to extend this class rather than the
 * contract above it, and the type guard enforces that rather than merely
 * reporting on it: a value that is a `FabricPrimitive` but not a
 * `BaseFabricPrimitive` is a broken subclass, so the guard throws instead of
 * quietly returning `false` and letting the mistake travel.
 *
 * The placeholder member is here in order to be a member at all -- an instance
 * type with nothing in it would make an ordinary `value is` guard collapse --
 * and its only observable behavior is refusing to be called.
