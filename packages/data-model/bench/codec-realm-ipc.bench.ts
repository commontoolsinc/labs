/**
 * What this format costs across the boundary it exists for: a real Deno
 * `Worker`, a real `postMessage()`, a decode on the far side, and an ack back.
 *
 * Run with:
 *
 *     deno bench --allow-read --no-check bench/codec-realm-ipc.bench.ts
 *
 * `--allow-read` because starting a `Worker` reads its module from disk.
 *
 * Every subject is measured twice, and the pair is the point. A `decode` case
 * asks the far side to reconstruct the value; a `clone` case asks it to leave
 * the tree alone and ack. Both pay the same send, the same structured clone
 * and the same return leg, so **the difference between them is the far-side
 * decode and nothing else** -- which is the number to take away, since the
 * transport underneath it is not this format's to change.
 *
 * The two together also say what fraction of a crossing this format is
 * responsible for at all. If `clone` dominates, the encoding is not where the
 * cost lives and tuning it buys little.
 *
 * One message is in flight at a time. That is what a `Deno.bench()` iteration
 * can measure -- an iteration is one round trip, so a pipeline of overlapping
 * sends would report throughput while the harness is timing latency -- and it
 * is the shape the worker IPC this format exists for actually uses.
 *
 * The sender's tree is reused across iterations rather than re-encoded.
 * `postMessage()` clones, so the far side consumes its own copy: ceding is a
 * promise to the *decoder*, and the sender is not the decoder here. Same-realm
 * that is exactly the distinction `decode()`'s contract turns on.
