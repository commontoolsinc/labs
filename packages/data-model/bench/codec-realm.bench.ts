/**
 * Realm-crossing codec performance benchmarks, encoding and decoding.
 *
 * Run with:
 *
 *     deno bench --no-check bench/codec-realm.bench.ts
 *
 * The subjects come from `fixtures/codec-fixtures.ts`, the same ones
 * `codec-json.bench.ts` measures, so the two tables line up subject for
 * subject: a row here and the row named for the same subject there differ by
 * the format and nothing else. Names carry a `realm-` prefix so that a run
 * covering both files keeps them apart.
 *
 * Two series carry most of what this format is for. `pass-through` holds only
 * values structured cloning takes directly, so encoding returns the tree by
 * identity and the walk is the whole cost; `json-pass-through` holds only what
 * JSON also takes directly. The gap between those two rows, read against the
 * same two rows in the JSON table, is what a second format buys.
 *
 * The `bytes` and `bigint` series answer a narrower question, and answer it
 * against each other: both are sized in bytes, so a row from one and the row
 * of the same size from the other carry the same quantity of data. Cloning
 * takes each as itself, and takes a `bigint` in constant time whatever its
 * magnitude. JSON reaches the same wire form for both -- base64url of a
 * two's-complement byte string, the same length to within a character -- and
 * still spends several times more on the `bigint`, which is what the four
 * columns are for.
 *
 * **A decoded tree carries no guarantee of being usable again.** `decode()`
 * cedes its input, and `FabricBytes` takes over the `ArrayBuffer` it arrived
 * in, which detaches it -- so a tree carrying bytes cannot be decoded twice.
 * That is by design, the tree across a real boundary being the receiver's own
 * clone, and it decides the shape of the decode direction here:
 *
 * * Subjects that survive repeated decoding take the plain `fn()` form.
 * * The omnibus subjects hold a `FabricBytes`, so each iteration encodes a
 *   fresh tree outside `b.start()` / `b.end()` and measures only the decode.
 *   Deno honors that bracketing when an iteration averages at least 10µs and
 *   warns when it does not; these are far above it, but that is a fact about
 *   this machine rather than about the subjects, so read the warnings.
 * * `single-bytes` and the whole `bytes` series are too small for bracketing
 *   to be honored, so each appears as a `round-trip` row instead -- named for
 *   what it measures rather than reported as a decode that is really an encode
 *   and a decode. Nothing is lost by it: a byte decode takes the buffer over
 *   by `transfer()` rather than copying, so it is ~1µs at any size, and the
 *   climb those rows show is the encode's copy.
 *
 * Every other decode row reuses one encoded tree across all of its iterations,
 * which the guarantee does not cover: it works because a byte-free tree holds
 * nothing the walk consumes, not because a decoded tree is promised to
 * survive. Measured, it also costs nothing -- a reused tree and a fresh one
 * per iteration are within noise of each other, the reused one being frozen by
 * its first decode and V8 not caring. **A decode that exploited ceding harder
 * would silently turn these rows into measurements of something else**, so a
 * change to what `decode()` retains is a reason to revisit this file.
