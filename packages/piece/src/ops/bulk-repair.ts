/**
 * Bulk repair: a caller-supplied fixer — a pure transform from a piece's
 * stored input document to the document it should hold — iterated over a
 * selection by the same spine the survey walks. The tooling owns selection,
 * ordering, the write, the stop, and resume; the fixer owns only what the
 * change is (docs/plans/piece-bulk-operations.md, stage 2).
 *
 * The fixer is its own predicate. A piece the fixer would not change needs
 * nothing, so selection ("keep what it would change"), resume ("already
 * repaired reads as unchanged"), and verification ("re-running over the
 * stored result is a no-op") are one mechanism, and none of them can drift
 * from what the fixer does because they are what the fixer does. That is
 * why a fixer must be a pure function of the document, and why this module
 * probes the purity it cannot prove: every evaluation runs the fixer twice
 * and refuses an answer that differs.
 *
 * The write is the wide one — the whole input document replaced — made safe
 * by refusals rather than by narrowing: a document that lost a field the
 * fixer never mentioned is a defect, not an intent, and a reference
 * rewritten as a value or dropped is corruption either way. The apply is
 * transactional: the fixer is re-evaluated against the document the commit
 * actually sees, so a concurrent edit conflicts and re-runs rather than
 * being overwritten. A stored document is a `FabricValue` — references as
 * sigil links, and special values such as bytes as class instances — so
 * every copy, comparison, and hash below goes through the data-model's own
 * primitives, and the walkers treat anything that is not a plain record or
 * a direct array as one atomic value.
 *
 * The run's record is the plan artifact: each evaluated row carries the
 * hash of the document its answer was computed from, which is the repair
 * row's precondition the way the reference pair is a retarget row's.
