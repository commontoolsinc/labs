/**
 * The survey-diff: one survey compared against the plan it was taken for, or
 * against an earlier survey. This is the verification every write stage uses
 * — an apply that exits zero is not a verdict, and the report of what a run
 * actually did is the before-survey held against the after-survey.
 *
 * Three verdicts matter for a row that carries an operation — a retarget or
 * a restore, both of which name the reference they produce: `landed` (on the
 * reference the op produces), `outstanding` (still on the recorded
 * reference), and `moved-elsewhere` (on neither — nothing in the plan
 * accounts for where it is, which is what a half-converged upgrade looks
 * like). Rows without an op are a pre-state record and diff to
 * `unchanged`/`changed`. Every comparison is on the full executable pointer,
 * `{identity, symbol}` — an identity alone conflates two patterns one module
 * exports.
