/**
 * Restoring a piece to a retained revision: the runtime operation
 * `PieceController.changeSource({kind: "restore"})` performs, read and
 * driven from one place.
 *
 * A piece keeps an append-only log of the source states it has accepted
 * (`docs/specs/piece-source-lifecycle.md`). Restoring means picking one of
 * those revisions and running the source the space still retains behind it —
 * no local file, no recompilation of anything but the retained bytes. This
 * module holds the two things a caller needs around that operation: which
 * revisions a piece could be returned to, and the resolution from the
 * reference a rollback plan recorded to the revision that carries it.
 *
 * The single-piece restore and the bulk rollback share both, so the two
 * cannot disagree about which revision a reference names or about whether a
 * revision can be restored at all.
