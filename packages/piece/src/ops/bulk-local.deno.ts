 * the ops barrel, which browser-hosted callers import.
 *
 * The identity is the pin on a retarget row: the plan records the identity
 * the named source produces, computed here without compiling, and the apply
 * recomputes it from the source it actually resolved, refusing the row on a
 * mismatch. `rev` is a label for readers, never enforced. A source that
 * mounts other patterns over `cf:` fabric imports is the one shape this
 * cannot compute — the identity walk refuses it — and takes the compile path
 * instead.
