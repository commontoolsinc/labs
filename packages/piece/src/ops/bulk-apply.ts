/**
 * The apply engine every bulk write stage runs on: serial, in plan order,
 * each row's precondition proved before its write, stopping at the first
 * failure with the remainder named, and recomputing what is outstanding on
 * every invocation (docs/plans/piece-bulk-operations.md).
 *
 * The plan is the whole input: each row carries the reference pair the piece
 * must still be on (`expect`) and the pair its operation produces (`op`), and
 * classification compares both halves of a pair, never an identity alone. A
 * piece on its row's `expect` pair is outstanding; on the `op` pair it landed
 * and is not rewritten, which is what makes a re-invocation a resume; on
 * neither, something this plan does not account for moved it, and the run
 * stops — or never starts, when preflight finds it first.
 *
 * Sessions are grouped: a fresh session serves a bounded number of pieces
 * and is then released, so the expensive warm-up is paid once per group
 * while the pieces live at once stay bounded by the group size — a knob,
 * not a constant. A group boundary is thereby a resume point: a run that
 * dies inside a group loses at most that group's warm-up, because every
 * landed row reads as landed on the next invocation.
 *
 * What differs between the stages is one step: what a row's write does. That
 * arrives as a {@link PlanOperation} — the retarget's is resolving a local
 * source and setting it, the rollback's is restoring a retained revision —
 * and everything around it is shared, so the two cannot drift in how a
 * precondition is checked, how a stop names its remainder, or what a resume
 * rewrites.
 *
 * Applying implies no verdict. The verification is the survey-diff — a
 * survey taken afterwards, compared against this plan — and it stays a
 * separate invocation by design; this module only applies and reports.
