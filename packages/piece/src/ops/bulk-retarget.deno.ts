/**
 * Bulk retarget: the upgrade apply. One source package moves across the
 * pieces a plan names, on the shared apply engine
 * ([bulk-apply.ts](./bulk-apply.ts)) that owns selection, preconditions,
 * ordering, stopping, and resumption (docs/plans/piece-bulk-operations.md,
 * stage 3). What lives here is the one step that is the retarget's own: what
 * a row's write does.
 *
 * Deno-only, like the local resolution it builds on: each row's source is
 * resolved from disk and its identity recomputed — without compiling —
 * immediately before the write, and a source that no longer produces the
 * reference its row recorded is refused rather than applied.
 *
 * The write detaches the piece from the origin it follows: the source it
 * runs afterwards is the one this plan names, chosen by a human, and a piece
 * still carrying that origin could be repointed afterwards to whatever the
 * origin ships, leaving the plan's reviewer having approved a reference the
 * piece no longer keeps. What the run
 * detaches is recorded — the plan row's `expect.origin`, carried onto every
 * report row — and re-attached by hand or not at all. Nothing here
 * re-attaches: the runtime's `follow` resolves the origin NOW and adopts
 * whatever source it currently ships, which is not the reference a rollback
 * promises to land, and the restore a rollback runs detaches in its own
 * right by design (`docs/specs/piece-source-lifecycle.md`).
 *
 * The row's own precondition rides into the write rather than stopping at
 * the recheck that proved it. A piece is read once to classify it and again
 * by the write itself, and a writer landing between those two reads is
 * invisible to the first; the reference the recheck proved is therefore
 * handed to `setPattern`, which refuses the write rather than adopting
 * whatever it finds. The rollback's write step carries the same pin, so
 * "checks preconditions the same way" holds through the write and not only
 * up to it.
