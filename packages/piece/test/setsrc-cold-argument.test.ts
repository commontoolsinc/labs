// CT-1917 at the `cf piece setsrc` boundary: a slot the piece cannot READ right
// now is not a slot holding the wrong value.
//
// A piece's argument document is not always resident. A nested piece's argument
// lives in its HOST's document, so while the host has not synced the whole
// argument reads as nothing. Runner deliberately DEFERS that state rather than
// failing it: `applySetupState` preserves the stored bytes and lets the swap
// proceed, because refusing would make every such piece un-updatable for
// reasons that have nothing to do with its stored value.
// `packages/runner/test/pattern-update-argument-validation.test.ts` pins the
// same deferral one layer down ("defers an argument doc that reads NOTHING on
// the in-place path").
//
// `setPattern` has to inherit that deferral, and there is one specific way to
// lose it: running the aggregate compatibility review BEFORE the swap. That
// review materializes the stored argument and validates it against the
// candidate's schema, and it cannot tell a cold document from a wrong one — over
// a cold document it validates `undefined` and refuses. An earlier revision of
// PR #5311 did exactly that, to name every incompatibility at once, and a
// reviewer found it by execution: two revisions with IDENTICAL schemas carrying
// a required field, which `main` swaps happily, were refused with "updated
// arguments do not match the candidate schema: value does not match type
// object".
//
// So enforcement stays where it was: `assertPatternSchemasBackwardCompatible`
// plus the execute-time validators, all of which defer a cold read. Whatever
// else `setPattern` does with the aggregate review, it must not be allowed to
// decide ACCEPTANCE — and this case is the guard on that, failing the moment it
// is put back in front of the swap.
//
// Every other case in this package supplies a WARM argument, which is why the
// regression got through — a warm argument validates fine either way.

/**
 * Two revisions whose argument schemas are IDENTICAL, each carrying a REQUIRED
 * object field. Identical schemas are what isolates the argument check: the
 * contract proof (`assertPatternSchemasBackwardCompatible`) has nothing to
 * complain about, so the only rule that can refuse this swap is one that reads
 * the stored argument. `required` with no default is what makes the read
 * decisive — validating `undefined` against it cannot pass.
 *
 * `marker` is the only difference, so a successful swap is observable in the
 * piece's own output rather than inferred.
