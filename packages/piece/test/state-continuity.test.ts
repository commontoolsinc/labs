/**
 * Tier 2: replay a captured prior state under a NEW pattern version.
 *
 * Shape of each case: capture a real space written by the OLD pattern,
 * snapshot it, then open a fresh runtime over that snapshot and materialize
 * the NEW pattern onto the same root through the production repair call.
 *
 * Where the line with Tier 1 falls — measured, and pinned by the last case
 * here so neither tier is dropped on a wrong assumption about the other:
 *
 * - Additive REQUIRED output with no default: accepted by both tiers because
 *   the new pattern generates that result during setup. Tier 1 accepts the
 *   output contract, and the runner's role-aware CFC merge accepts the write
 *   that materializes it over the legacy root. Replaying it here pins the whole
 *   capture → snapshot → reopen → materialize pipeline.
 * - Moving where a field is STORED under an identical contract: this tier
 *   only. The two result schemas are byte-identical, so no contract check can
 *   see it, and nothing throws — the data is simply gone. What a pattern
 *   writes is not determined by its schema.
 * - Typing a key on an OPEN argument object: shared with the runner, and for a
 *   sharper reason than the one above. Tier 1 does not fail to see it — it
 *   WAIVES it, on the ground that the runner validates merged durable arguments
 *   in the setup transaction. That guard is real and reached on both update
 *   routes (`packages/runner/test/pattern-update-argument-validation.test.ts`);
 *   what this tier adds is driving it from a vintage a real prior version
 *   wrote, so the waiver is checked against a captured argument rather than an
 *   in-process one.
 *
 * Nothing else on the obvious list earns a case here. Dropping a result field,
 * narrowing one to a disjoint type, and moving a field between nesting levels
 * are all contract changes Tier 1 rejects outright ("existing result field was
 * removed", "type … is not accepted by the candidate schema" — a nesting move
 * reports as a removal). Adding cases for them would grow the slowest tier
 * without covering anything the fastest one misses.
