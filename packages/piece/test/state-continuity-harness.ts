/**
 * Tier 2 of the pattern-update regime: prove a new pattern can still READ the
 * state an older version of itself wrote.
 *
 * Tier 1 (`deno task pattern-compat`) proves the argument/result contract is
 * backward compatible. That is a statement about schemas, and schemas do not
 * describe everything a pattern writes: move where a field is STORED
 * (`.for('items')` → `.for('itemList')`) and the declared contract does not
 * change by a single byte, while every document written under the old name
 * becomes unreachable. No contract comparison can see that, and nothing
 * throws — only replaying a real prior state catches it.
 *
 * It also replays additive required OUTPUT evolution. That class is compatible:
 * the candidate pattern generates the new result during setup, so Tier 1
 * accepts the result contract and the runner's role-aware CFC merge accepts the
 * generated write over the legacy root. The replay pins that behavior through
 * capture → snapshot → reopen → materialize rather than only at either isolated
 * schema boundary.
 *
 * The state is captured as a **SQLite space store**, not a bespoke JSON dump.
 * A space is one SQLite file, `snapshotSpaceStore` already writes a
 * crash-consistent copy of one, and restoring is a file copy — where a JSON
 * dump would need a re-writer that reconstructs docs, causes and links, and
 * getting causes wrong silently produces a fixture that is not the state that
 * was captured.
 *
 * Capture is deliberately file-backed: `StorageManager.emulate` runs a real
 * memory server against `:memory:`, which has no file to snapshot.

/**

 * Two measured wins, on the four committed fixtures (42.2 MiB together):
 *
 * - **`commit.original.operations` is a byte-for-byte duplicate of the whole
 *   `revision` table.** Verified by joining `json_each(original,'$.operations')`
 *   to `revision` on `commit_seq`+`op_index`: equal counts, ids, ops and
 *   payloads in all four. The `commit` table is 42-50% of each file and
 *   outweighs `revision` itself in three of them.
 * - **`page_size` is 32 KiB**, which costs 1.2-1.4 MiB of near-empty pages per
 *   file — 38% of the smallest one. Plain `VACUUM` reclaims nothing
 *   (`freelist_count` is already 0); the waste is inside pages, not between
 *   them.
 *
 * Together: 42.2 MiB → 21.8 MiB checked out. The fixtures stay RAW rather than
 * compressed, which is a separate measurement: git's own zlib beats
 * pre-gzipping (3.11 vs 3.25 MiB packed at one generation) and deltas a
 * recapture ~5x better (+0.21 vs +1.03 MiB on a second topics generation),
 * because it cannot delta a gzip stream.
 *
 * **Only `operations` goes, and the rest of the envelope stays.** Blanking the
 * whole column is smaller still (16.7 MiB) and was measured to leave the gate
 * byte-identical — but `commit.original` has THREE readers, not the one the
 * engine has, and the other two are the shipping `cf inspect`:
 *
 * - `state-inspector/conflicts.ts` prefilters candidate reader commits with
 *   `WHERE original LIKE '%'||id||'%'` and then reads `$.reads.confirmed`.
 *   With the column blanked, that prefilter matched 0 of topics' 353 commits,
 *   so the stale-read detector returned "no anomalies" for every fixture —
 *   a CONFIDENT CLEAN BILL it cannot otherwise produce, and the one output
 *   whose whole purpose is flagging corruption. Keeping `reads` restores it:
 *   309 of 353 match again.
 * - `state-inspector/queries.ts` `listCommits` decodes `original` for its
 *   `ops`/`reads` counts. Its `ops` column reads 0 on these fixtures, which is
 *   the one degradation this transform knowingly keeps: the operations are
 *   still all there in `revision`, which is where `cf inspect history`,
 *   `timeline` and `diff` read them from.
 *
 * The engine's own use is unaffected either way: `sameStoredOriginal`
 * (`memory/v2/engine.ts`) is a string equality reached only through
 * `SELECT_EXISTING_COMMIT`, keyed `session_id`+`local_seq`, and a fresh replay
 * session cannot match a stored session id. Commit ROWS always stay, so
 * `MAX(seq)` allocation and the `revision.commit_seq` foreign key are intact.
 *
 * Proven equivalent rather than assumed: the gate was run against a pruned
 * copy and an untouched one with every pattern's identity forced to change, so
 * 50 targets actually materialized, and the two produced byte-identical output
 * including all 18 failure diagnostics.
 *
 * The right long-term fix is in the engine — storing a hash of the operations
 * rather than the operations — at which point this becomes a no-op and should
 * be deleted.

 *   whose own enumerable properties include `runtime`. A generic deep copy
 *   therefore copies the whole runtime object graph into the snapshot, cycles
 *   and all. Measured on the committed `home.tsx` fixture: the copy is cyclic
 *   (`scheduler` → `runtime` → back), `JSON.stringify` on it throws, and the
 *   copy compares UNEQUAL to the live cell it came from because one side is a
 *   plain object and the other a class instance — so every stream key reports
 *   as stranded and printing the finding takes the run down with it. Reduced
 *   here to the DOCUMENT the cell points at, which is the durable thing about
 *   it: a stream that moved to a different doc still shows up, and the schema
 *   is deliberately dropped, being a view rather than data.
 * - **A `FabricSpecialObject`** (`FabricBytes`, an epoch). These hold their
 *   state in private fields, so a structural comparison sees two objects with
 *   no properties and calls them equal REGARDLESS of contents —
 *   `deepEqual`'s own documentation says so, and it is the quietest way a
 *   comparison can pass. Reduced to a tagged content hash, which is the
 *   data-model's own notion of equality for them (`valueEqual` ends in the same
 *   hash) without needing a comparator that also has to survive link sigils.
 * - **A cycle.** Even with cells reduced, the data itself may point back at
 *   itself; `deepEqual` recurses until the stack ends. Cut with a marker rather
 *   than by sharing the copy, so what comes out of here is acyclic — which is
 *   what lets a failure report stringify it.
 * - **A rendering.** A VNode is recomputed by the setup from the pattern body,
 *   so the stored one and a fresh one differ whenever the source that renders
 *   them was touched at all. `strandedKeys` excludes the `$UI` FAMILY by name,
 *   which reaches a rendering stored AT a known key and nothing else — and a
 *   transformer hoist (`__cfPattern_N`, the body of a `map`) is a recorded
 *   instantiation whose whole result IS a vnode, with keys `type`/`name`/
 *   `props`/`children`. Measured on the committed `default-app.tsx` fixture: a
 *   UI-only edit inside that map body reported `children` stranded on both
 *   recorded hoist roots and took the gate to exit 1, for a change that stores
 *   nothing. Reduced by SHAPE here, so a rendering is out of the comparison
 *   wherever it sits rather than only where it is named.
 *
 * Everything else is copied plainly, and `bigint` and `undefined` pass through
 * as themselves — the two values a JSON round-trip could not carry.
 *
 * Idempotent: run over its own output it returns an equal structure, so a
 * caller that normalizes early and a caller that normalizes late agree.

/**
 * `schema` relaxed for READING rather than for validating: every `unknown` TYPE
 * dropped so a read descends where the declared type stopped it, and every
 * `required` dropped so one property that does not resolve cannot hide the
 * rest of the object.
 *
 * A schema-driven read carries nothing at a `{"type": "unknown"}` position —
 * `schemaTypeValidity` in `traverse.ts` returns `Unknown` there, so the read
 * stops at a reference WHATEVER the document holds. That is the right answer
 * for a reader; it is the wrong one for this comparison, because "the schema
 * declined to look" then reads exactly like "the document does not hold it",
 * and `isPreserved` treats the second as nothing to lose.
 *
 * It is not a corner. Measured on the committed fixtures, `unknown` is what a
 * declared `unknown` field and an INDEX SIGNATURE both lower to — the second
 * as `additionalProperties: {"type": "unknown"}` — and `default-app.tsx`
 * declares `[key: string]: unknown` on its output. Its root holds
 * `summaryIndex`, a whole nested pattern result. Under the stored schema
 * verbatim it reads back carrying none of its contents, and a change that
 * stranded it would have replayed clean.
 *
 * `required` goes for a different reason, measured on the committed topics
 * fixture. A schema-driven read returns `undefined` for the WHOLE object when a
 * required property does not resolve — and a pattern's own result schema marks
 * its session-local drafts required: `topic.tsx` requires `bodyDraft`,
 * `commentDraft`, `editingBody`, `linkUrlDraft` and `linkLabelDraft`, each a
 * link to a per-session cell that holds nothing in a fresh replay runtime. All
 * 28 keys of real state then read as nothing, and the entry was reported as a
 * recorded root the fixture does not hold. EVERY recorded `topic.tsx` target
 * failed that way, so the gate examined no topics state at all while reporting
 * loudly. `main.tsx` fell to the same collapse through `$NAME` and `newTitle`.
 *
 * Dropping it cannot hide a loss, which is what makes this safe rather than
 * merely convenient: the comparison is per key, so a key that resolved before
 * and does not after is still a finding. `required` only ever decided whether
 * the object collapsed ENTIRELY — and a collapse reports one unreadable root
 * instead of the moved key it was hiding. It is dropped at every depth for the
 * same reason it is dropped at the top: a nested object collapses identically,
 * and the key holding it would read as stranded.
 *
 * Beyond those two, keywords survive — that is what keeps this a RELAXATION
 * rather than a different read: `asCell`, `ifc` and the rest still apply, so a
 * stream still reduces to the document it points at (reading under a bare `{}`
 * instead would resolve it to its value and lose the moved-document class this
 * comparison exists for). The result is still a schema-driven read, so it is
 * still deterministic — unlike a schema-less `.get()`, which resolves whatever
 * is already loaded and is the shape of bug that made a cross-space profile
 * read as absent (#3830).

 *   makes its `path` a subset-able array, so a stream that moved from `[]` to
 *   `["value"]` in the same document — a longer path, nothing missing from it —
 *   reads as preserved. Compared whole instead.
 * - **A before-value of `undefined` is not data.** The before state is read
 *   under the root's stored schema, and a schema-driven read enumerates the
 *   keys the schema declares whether or not the document holds them: measured
 *   on the committed fixtures, `defaultProfile` on `home.tsx` reads as
 *   `undefined` because the root predates any profile being created.
 *   Comparing that would report an update that starts filling it in — adding a
 *   `Default<>` to a field already declared — as having stranded state that
 *   was never there. Held nothing, lost nothing.
 *
 *   This branch is only honest because the read cannot ALSO return `undefined`
 *   for a key the document does hold. It could, before
 *   `schemaRelaxedForComparison`: an `unknown` position resolves to `undefined`
 *   whatever is stored there, and measured on the committed `default-app.tsx`
 *   fixture that hid `summaryIndex`, which held real state and was

 * nothing left for this check to compare, and rests on the refusal, completion
 * and reads-as-something checks instead.
 *
 * Everything else is compared by SHAPE rather than by name. A value the

 * than skipped.
 *
 * Both sides go through it here rather than only at the call site: the before
 * state arrives already reduced, but the after state is whatever the
 * materialize returned — a LIVE root value — and comparing a detached copy
 * against a live one reports every cell-valued key as stranded. It is
 * idempotent, so normalizing the already-normalized side costs a walk and
 * removes a way to hold this wrong.
 *
 * Compared with `deepEqual`, not stringified. Serialization is the wrong
 * instrument twice over: it is key-order sensitive, so two equivalent objects
 * whose properties were emitted in a different order would report as stranded,
 * and it cannot represent everything a durable doc may hold — a `bigint` throws.
 *
 * `deepEqual` rather than the data-model's `valueEqual`, which is the more
 * obvious choice. `valueEqual` refuses a materialized root outright — measured,
 * it throws ``Cannot compare value `{"/":{"link@1":{…}}}` `` — but NOT for the
 * reason that message reads as: a link sigil compares fine, and the value it
 * actually refused was a live CELL, rendered through its `toJSON()` and so
 * printed as the sigil it points at. That is the same fact `comparableState`
 * exists for. Both comparators work once the reduction has run, and this one is
 * kept because it needs no value to be a well-formed `FabricValue` and
 * short-circuits instead of hashing a whole VNode tree; the one class it cannot
 * judge, a `FabricSpecialObject` with its state in private fields, is reduced
 * to a content hash before it gets here rather than being compared by it.

 * that opened but never committed is a valid empty database, an entity id is
 * content-derived and so names a cell in any space, and a cell nobody wrote
 * reads as absent rather than as an error. Materializing onto one of those
 * SUCCEEDS — the root then holds today's defaults, `isPresentRootValue` is
 * satisfied, and the entry counts as updated cleanly over state that was never
 * there. Measured: with a companion store truncated to zero bytes, a break that
 * the gate is built to catch replays with no failures at all.
 *
 * The evidence is a RUNNER-WRITTEN MARKER, not a value. A value check would
 * depend on the pattern's result shape, and a root whose result is
 * legitimately `{}` would read as missing. For a NATIVE capture the marker is
 * `patternSetupIdentity`: the runner stamps it under the same condition that
 * reports an instantiation to the capture observer (`runner.ts` —
 * deliberately the same, so the store cannot label roots the observer missed
 * or vice versa), so every observer-recorded entry's cell carries one by
 * construction. An ADOPTED fixture's manifest is written by
 * `tasks/vintage-adopt.ts` instead of the observer, and its store may predate
 * the setup marker entirely — its roots carry only `patternIdentity`.
 *
 * PRESENCE only — this does not check that the marker names the entry's own
 * identity and symbol. Deliberately: a root set up twice under different
 * identities in one capture would then false-red, and correspondence is not
 * reachable from a legitimate capture anyway, since the observer and the stamp
 * describe the same `resultCell`.
 *
 * EITHER marker satisfies presence, therefore. `patternSetupIdentity` (#4915)
 * postdates spaces the runner still rolls forward in production, whose roots
 * carry only `patternIdentity` — a fixture captured by an old toolchain
 * (CT-1941) holds exactly that shape, and refusing it would exclude the
 * vintages this tier exists to replay. The older marker is a weaker claim
 * (pattern loaded, not setup completed), but for THIS question — "was
 * something really captured here, or is this a valid empty database?" —
 * either stamp is evidence only the runner writes.
