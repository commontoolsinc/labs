// The manual-rescue case for a stranded piece. A piece whose stored

// space's wish-minted profile sidecars, pinned to an identity only a retired
// bundle could load — cannot take a source replacement: `setPattern` loads the
// current pattern before anything else, and that load fails on exactly the
// piece a replacement would rescue. The loaded pattern feeds only the two
// checks `dangerouslyAllowIncompatibleSchema` already waives (the
// backward-compatibility assertion and retained-link validation), so under the
// flag a failed load degrades to the stored identity ref alone, and the swap
// proceeds against a piece that cannot say what it used to run. Without the
// flag the failure stays loud and nothing moves — the flag is the entire
// difference, which is what this red/green pair pins.
