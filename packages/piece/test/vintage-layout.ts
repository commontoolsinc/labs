/**
 * Where a vintage fixture's SPACES live on disk.

 * A space is one SQLite file, so a capture that instantiates a pattern in
 * another space (`Factory.inSpace(...)` — how a profile is created) writes a
 * SECOND file, and a fixture that copied only the first would record roots
 * whose state it does not hold. The companion directory sits beside the primary
 * file, holds one raw `.sqlite` per other space, and travels with it in git —
 * raw, so delta compression still works (see `tasks/pattern-vintage-lib.ts`).
 *
 * Its own module, and a deliberately empty one: `state-continuity-harness.ts`
 * needs this rule to write and restore a fixture, and `pattern-vintage-lib.ts`
 * needs it to tell a companion from a fixture — and that second module is pure
 * path parsing whose unit test should not have to load the runner, the memory
 * server and the identity stack to check a string. Importing the harness for a
 * constant took its dependency graph from 11 modules to 765.
