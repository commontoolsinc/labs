/**
 * What the board and a topic actually RENDER through whatever projection the
 * board declares for its topics: that a card carries its topic's text, and
 * that the body editor's completion source reaches it populated.
 *
 * Both assertions were validated by mutation — remove the step that files a
 * topic and both go red — so neither is decoration.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT CATCH, stated because the gap is not obvious and I walked
 * into it: narrowing `mentionable` to a projection WITHOUT `[NAME]` leaves
 * both assertions green. `cf-code-editor` declares its entries as
 * `Mentionable`, whose schema carries `required: [NAME]`
 * (`packages/ui/src/v2/core/mentionable.ts`), but that filtering happens at
 * the COMPONENT's read in the browser. A pattern test sees the cell, not the
 * component's schema-filtered view of it, so the entries still carry their
 * name here however narrowly the pattern declared them. Only a browser test
 * crosses that boundary; `packages/patterns/integration/topic-board-*` is
 * where that guard belongs.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from topics.test.tsx: it touches no verb through the
 * board's projection, so it keeps compiling while a demand-narrowing change is
 * in flight — which is exactly when the render contract needs guarding.
