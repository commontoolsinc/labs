 *
 * The nine fields cover the card, compact index, activity sort, reference
 * pivot, and mention autocomplete. Seven carry defaults so a missing path does
 * not make the whole array unreadable. Two do not, for different reasons:
 * `createdAt` is required, because the Topic pattern defaults its input and
 * publishes that path unconditionally, and `shortName` is optional, because a
 * default there cannot be applied over a board deployed before the namespace.

 *

 * already guards it with `mentions[from]?.some(...)`. So the tolerance is not
 * being added here; the producer is being made to honor the contract its own

 *
 * A read taken straight off the cell gets no help from the compiler. `get()` on

 * is a compile error: `deno task cfcheck` fails with "Object is possibly

 * hand-maintained path list in `tasks/typecheck.ts`, which this package is not
