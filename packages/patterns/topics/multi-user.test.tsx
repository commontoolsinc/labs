/**
 * Multi-user pattern test for Topics (CT-1878).
 *
 * One shared Topics board across two worker-isolated runtimes. Covers the
 * board's core multi-user promises:
 * - every headless mutation carries its agent signature atomically,
 * - topics created by either user propagate to the other, with structured
 *   authorship snapshots taken at write time.
 *
 * Concurrent comment appends — both landing, mergeable `push`, no clobbering —
 * are exercised on a topic the setup holds DIRECTLY, not on one reached
 * through the board. That is not a convenience: the board's demand carries
 * neither the thread nor the verbs that write it, so a comment cannot be
 * appended through the board's projection at all. What this file asserts of
 * the board is therefore topic propagation and authorship, never a thread.
 *
 * That leaves one thing no assertion here can make: that a real append raises
 * the `commentCount` the board's index publishes. Proving it needs a topic
 * resolved to its own piece from a board that created it, which is
 * `packages/patterns/integration/topic-board-child-contract.test.ts` — it
 * reads `index[0].commentCount`, appends, and reads it again.
 *
 * Cross-runtime reads use INLINE literal accesses (topics[0].comments[0]) —
 * `.map()`, loop-variable indexing, and helper calls over another runtime's
 * arrays do not resolve before a local write (see lunch-poll and scrabble
 * multi-user tests).
