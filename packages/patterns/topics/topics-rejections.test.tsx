/**
 * Rejection-path tests for the Topics mutating verbs (verb contract rule 4,
 * docs/plans/pattern-verb-contract.md: rejection is a value, never a silent
 * no-op). Every action here makes a verb throw, so the runtime errors are
 * required (`expectRuntimeErrors: 35` — exact count, so a rejection quietly
 * reverting to a silent return fails the suite); each assertion then verifies
 * the write did NOT land. Happy and legacy paths live in topics.test.tsx — including the UI
 * composer wrappers, whose silent guards are correct behavior (an empty draft
 * is a non-event in a composer, not a headless mutation).
