// A worked example of the two pattern-facing surfaces of the timing
// side-channel mitigations.
//
// 1. Reading time — the reactive `#now` clock. You cannot read the wall clock in
//    reactive code: `Date.now()` / `new Date()` throw in a lift, a computed, or
//    the pattern body (a live clock read would make the computation
//    non-idempotent). The replacement is the `#now` wish:
//      wish({ query: "#now" })     one durable snapshot — the piece's
//                                  FIRST-EVER load; reloads and other
//                                  runtimes read the original capture
//      wish({ query: "#now/N" })   a fresh snapshot every N seconds
//    Both are coarse (one second) and grid-aligned, and read `null` until the
//    wish resolves — so guard for that load window. `new Date(ms)` with an
//    explicit argument is deterministic and is NOT gated.
//
// 2. Receiving input — delivery shaping (W3 events, plan-B cell flips). Input
//    reaches a pattern two ways, and both are shaped by the same token bucket: the
//    "Tap" button sends an event to a handler, and each keystroke in the text box
//    writes a bound `$value` cell that a derived value observes. A pattern's only
//    sub-second timing signal is the rate of input it observes, so the shaper
//    floors the SUSTAINED rate to about one delivery per second while leaving
//    ordinary interaction realtime: a burst of rapid taps or keystrokes (up to a
//    budget of ~10) is delivered immediately, and only sustained mashing/typing is
//    throttled. Nothing is dropped — every tap is counted, and the latest typed
//    value always arrives. Only real renderer input is shaped; a headless test is
//    delivered immediately.

function formatClock(ms: number): string {
  const d = new Date(ms);
  const pad = (n: number) => String(n).padStart(2, "0");
  return `${pad(d.getHours())}:${pad(d.getMinutes())}:${pad(d.getSeconds())}`;
}

// Runs when a (shaped) tap is actually delivered. The clock IS readable in a
// handler — coarsened to one second — so stamp when this delivery ran.

  Record<string, never>,

  taps.set(taps.get() + 1);
  lastTapAt.set(formatClock(Date.now()));

// `$value` binding). Renderer keystrokes are shaped; this test send is not.
