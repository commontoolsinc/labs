// Pattern-test for the CT-1768 fetch-mocking harness support: a test declares an
// outbound fetch mock via the `fetchMocks` named export, and the runner injects
// it into `runtime.fetch` so a `fetchJson` resolves against the mock instead of
// the network. The async fetch chain is driven to completion by the harness's
// existing `{ settle: true }` step (`runtime.settled()`), after which a value
// computed from the `fetchJson` result is observable — which it was not before.
//
// LLM calls (generateText/generateObject) mock separately via @commonfabric/llm;
// this seam is for generic `fetchJson` HTTP.
