/**
 * TEST PATTERN: ifElse with Simple Cell - WORKING (with caveats)
 *
 * CLAIM: ifElse with simple cell WORKS for conditional buttons (but has limitations)
 * SOURCE: folk_wisdom/onclick-handlers-conditional-rendering.md
 * CONFIRMED: 2025-12-03 session
 *
 * WHAT THIS TESTS:
 * Demonstrates that ifElse with a PLAIN CELL (not derived parameter) can work
 * for conditional button rendering without ReadOnlyAddressError.
 *
 * KEY INSIGHT: ifElse with plain LOCAL cell works, but may fail when the cell
 * comes from a composed sub-pattern (see caveat pattern).
 *
 * EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
 * - Pattern deploys successfully
 * - When showButton=true, button is visible and clickable
 * - When showButton=false, button is hidden
 * - Clicking button increments count without errors
 * - No ReadOnlyAddressError (unlike derive approach)
 * - Works because ifElse with plain cell doesn't create read-only context
 *
 * MANUAL VERIFICATION STEPS:
 * 1. Deploy this pattern to a test space
 * 2. Initially showButton=true, button should be visible
 * 3. Click "Increment" - count should increase without errors
 * 4. Uncheck "Show button" - button should disappear
 * 5. Check "Show button" again - button reappears
 * 6. Click button again - still works
 * 7. Verify no errors in browser console
 *
 * FRAMEWORK MECHANISM:
 * - ifElse with plain cell (not wrapped in derive) is evaluated directly
 * - Does not create inline data URI context like derive() does
 * - Cell references remain writable
 * - Handler can successfully call .set()
 *
 * CAVEAT: This works for LOCAL cells. If the cell comes from a composed
 * pattern, it may create reactive loops. See folk wisdom for details.
