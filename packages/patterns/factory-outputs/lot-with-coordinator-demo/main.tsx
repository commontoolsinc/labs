/**
 * Composed demo: Parking Coordinator + Lot Watch sharing a `people` cell.
 *
 * Demonstrates the cross-pattern UX: when a lot operator marks an unknown plate
 * as "Oh actually, that's Gideon's car" inside Lot Watch, Gideon (and the
 * plate) appears in Parking Coordinator's people list — because both inner
 * patterns are wired to the same `Writable.perSpace<Person[]>` cell.
 *
 * Both patterns also share `spots` per Lot Watch DESIGN §3a so the operator
 * doesn't need to maintain two spot lists.
