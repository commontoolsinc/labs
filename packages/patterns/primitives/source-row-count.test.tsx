/**
 * Tests SourceRowCount: the two numbers over a full table and an empty one, a

 * figure, and the failure text a table or column the store does not carry
 * produces.
 *
 * The atom takes no `reactOn`, because a database it only reads has nothing to
 * react to. Its `table` and `predicate` inputs are reactive, so a test seeds
 * the rows and then names a predicate, which is what re-runs the aggregate
 * over them.
