/**
 * Tests MailboxMonthHeaders: the tombstone rule, the month window, the sender
 * join, a hostile limit, the failure text, and the rendered list. The row
 * ceiling needs a month with more rows than it admits, so it is stated in
 * mailbox-month-headers-ceiling.test.tsx instead.
 *
 * The atom takes no `reactOn`, because a database it only reads has nothing to
 * react to. Its `month` and `limit` inputs are reactive, so a test seeds the
 * rows and then names a month, which is what re-runs the query over them.
 *
 * Run: deno task cf test packages/patterns/primitives/mailbox-month-headers.test.tsx
