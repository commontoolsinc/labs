/**
 * Tests MailboxMonthHeaders' row ceiling against a month that holds more rows
 * than the ceiling admits, which is the only way to tell a clamped limit from
 * an unclamped one: over a handful of rows the two answer the same.
 *
 * It reads counts and subjects and never `[UI]`. A rendered 500-row result is
 * a load still in flight when the runtime is disposed, which reports a
 * sync-load failure at teardown; the view is stated in the atom's other test,
 * over a month small enough to settle.
 *
 * Run: deno task cf test packages/patterns/primitives/mailbox-month-headers-ceiling.test.tsx
