/**
 * Tests the atoms demo: that every atom embeds with the inputs this host
 * passes, and that the host's own computed reads through an embedded atom.
 *
 * This host is what proves the atoms are usable as parts. It passes only the
 * inputs it cares about and leaves the rest to their defaults, so an atom that
 * made any input mandatory would fail here rather than in whatever composes it
 * later — which is how that defect was caught in the first place.
 *
 * Run: deno task cf test packages/patterns/primitives/demo/atoms-demo.test.tsx
