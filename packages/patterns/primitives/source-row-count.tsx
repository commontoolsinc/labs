/**
 * Counts the rows of one table in a database handed to it: `total` is every
 * row the table holds and `matching` is how many of them satisfy `predicate`,
 * a SQL boolean expression over that table's own columns. An empty predicate
 * counts every row, so `matching` equals `total`. Both numbers come from a
 * single aggregate statement, which answers with one row whatever the table
 * holds, and a statement the database refuses reports its own message —
 * `no such table` for a name the store does not carry, `no such column` for a
 * predicate over a column it does not declare. The numbers are derived from
 * the whole table rather than from any one row, so they are disclosed under
 * every label the table's rows carry.
