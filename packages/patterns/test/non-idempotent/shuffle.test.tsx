/**
 * Test that exercises a non-idempotent shuffle computation.
 * expectNonIdempotent asserts the idempotency check detects it; the test
 * FAILS if no violation is reported.
 *
 * The permutation alone is not a reliable detection signal: a 5-element
 * shuffle repeats the previous order 1 in 120 times, which is a real flake
 * rate once a missed detection fails the test. A counter cell that the
 * computation reads and increments on every run makes consecutive runs
 * differ with certainty while keeping the shuffle as the demonstrated
 * anti-pattern.
 *
 * Run: deno task cf test packages/patterns/test/non-idempotent/shuffle.test.tsx --verbose
