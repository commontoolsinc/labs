/**
 * Test that exercises a non-idempotent computation.
 * expectNonIdempotent asserts the idempotency check detects it; the test
 * FAILS if no violation is reported.
 *
 * The non-idempotency comes from a counter cell that the computation reads
 * and increments on every run, so the detector's recheck always observes a
 * different stamp than the run it verifies. Detection is deterministic and
 * does not depend on how slow the re-run happens to be.
 *
 * Run: deno task cf test packages/patterns/test/non-idempotent/timestamp.test.tsx --verbose
