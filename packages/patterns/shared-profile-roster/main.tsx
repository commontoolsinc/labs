/**
 * Shared-profile participant roster (CT-1649).
 *
 * Reference pattern for chat rooms / multiplayer lobbies. There is no runtime
 * primitive for "list every user's profile in this space", so instead each user
 * contributes their OWN entry on join, sourced from their shared profile
 * (`wish({ query: "#profile" })`). See `docs/specs/shared-profile-rosters.md`.
 *
 * This pattern demonstrates the **snapshot** (self-containment) variant: name +
 * avatar are copied at join time, so the roster is fully self-describing inside
 * the shared space and never depends on other users' profile spaces being
 * reachable. Participants render from those snapshot strings via `<cf-avatar>`,
 * and the current viewer's OWN live profile is shown with the trusted
 * `<cf-profile-badge>`.
 *
 * The recommended default is now the **live-link** variant — every participant
 * rendered with a live, visitable `<cf-profile-badge $profile={p.profile} />`
 * bound to their real profile cell (cross-space reads resolve for any authorized
 * viewer, CT-1667/1687). See `profile-roster-live-demo.tsx`. Prefer snapshotting
 * (this file) only when the roster must stay legible with remote profile spaces
 * offline, or when you deliberately want no live cross-space dependency.

 * Stable identity for a participant: the contributor's own `#profile` cell.

 * that user's own profile space) and is compared with `equals()`, the pattern
 * idiom for cell identity. Only the renderable fields are surfaced; identity
