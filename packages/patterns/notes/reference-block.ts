/**
 * The markdown reference-definition block a projected note carries.
 *
 * A note's mentions live in a map beside its text, so a file written out of
 * that note says nothing about where they point. Emitting the map as the
 * definition block it already resembles makes the file whole, and reading the
 * block back makes editing it a way of editing the mentions.
 *
 * The demanding property is exactness: a file written back untouched has to
 * parse to what was emitted, or every `touch` registers as an edit. That is
 * why the block is recognized structurally — a trailing run of definition
 * lines after a blank line — rather than diffed against what was generated.
