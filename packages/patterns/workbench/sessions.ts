/**
 * What a workbench reads and records about a person's agent sessions: the
 * agents connector's session index through narrow views, the sessions the
 * piece has attached to its subject, the starts it has sent, and the rows
 * its rail renders. Shared by the topic workbench and the person workbench,
 * which stay separate pieces because each one's queue, attachments, and
 * starts belong to the viewer; what they read of the index is the same.
 *
 * Attachments and starts are keyed records written with the mergeable
 * methods (`docs/features/keyed-collection-writes.md`), so the same person
 * writing from two tabs, or a session attaching itself from a skill, do not
 * overwrite each other. A start is confirmed by the index carrying the
 * session it named. That confirmation is derived on read, and a pattern
 * writes only in a handler, so the start's own record is what keeps a
 * started session attached: the record holds every start sent, and dropping
 * one detaches its session.
