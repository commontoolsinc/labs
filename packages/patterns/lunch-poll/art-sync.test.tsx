/**
 * Test: lunch-poll generated-art wiring — host-gated generation + explicit
 * keep-action persistence (the post-CT-1836 structure: the card reads the
 * GeneratedArt sub-pattern's fetch-derived outputs directly; nothing sends
 * from inside a computed).
 *
 * Single-identity caveat (as main.test.tsx): this runtime's one identity IS
 * the host after joining, so the host path runs end-to-end: join → add an
 * option → the host-gated GeneratedArt fetches the mocked /api/ai/img
 * generation (visible as the cf-image overlay) → the host keeps it — the
 * card's keep button sends { optionId, imageUrl } into `setOptionImage`; this
 * test drives that same stream directly with the imageUrl the button would
 * read — → the option carries `imageUrl` and the stored <img> renders. Every
 * other viewer renders that same stored value by construction (sourceUrl
 * short-circuits generation); the gate itself (shouldGenerate) is covered at
 * the sub-pattern level in generated-art.test.tsx.
