/**
 * Cozy Lunch Poll - Scoped
 *
 * Collaborative voting with three colors:
 *   🟢 green  (love it)   🟡 yellow (OK)   🔴 red (veto)
 *
 * Winner: fewest reds, then most greens.
 *
 * Identity is the viewer's shared profile CELL, compared with `equals()`:
 * - `users` is a per-space roster; each entry carries the participant's
 *   `#profile` cell as its identity, plus a name/avatar snapshot that is
 *   purely cosmetic. Two people who share a display name are two participants,
 *   and renaming yourself orphans nothing.
 * - "Am I joined?" is DERIVED by comparing the viewer's profile against the
 *   roster — no per-user state is stored, so nothing can go stale and lock a
 *   returning viewer out, on any device.
 * - Joining requires a resolved profile. There is no typed-name path, so a
 *   participant cannot be impersonated by typing their name.
 * - `host` (per-space) points at the first joiner's profile. They can
 *   add/remove options and reset votes. `isAdmin` is derived, not stored.
 * - Open host takeover: any joined participant can `claimHost`, transferring
 *   the role (and the host controls) to themselves. Deliberately ungated
 *   beyond "must be joined"; see `ADMIN-FUTURE.md`.
 * - A vote carries its voter's profile cell, and its key is that profile's
 *   ENTITY paired with the option. So a vote is addressed rather than searched
 *   for: casting, recasting and clearing one read and write that vote alone,
 *   two viewers voting at once touch different keys, and their commits merge
 *   with no conflict and no retry.
 *
 * "We went here" history (Lunch Coordinator roadmap #1): the host logs where
 * the group actually ate via each option's "we went here" button. A host date
 * field backdates the next log (blank = today; `logVisit` also takes an
 * explicit `wentAt`). The log shows as a "Recently eaten" list below the
 * options (8 most recent); the host can delete a single mistaken entry
 * (`removeHistoryEntry`) or clear the whole log.
 *
 * Storage: visits live in a `PerSpace<HistoryEntry[]>` array, capped at the
 * MAX_HISTORY most recent (by date). Each `logVisit` embeds a snapshot of
 * everyone's current vote in the entry's `votes` list — the option title is
 * denormalized, so the snapshot survives the option being removed. The
 * "📊 Lunch stats" card derives per-place visit + green/yellow/red tallies from
 * those embedded snapshots via a plain `computed` (the `tallyOptions` idiom).
 * Live voting stays on the in-cell `votes` array. Each history entry — and each
 * embedded vote — carries a frozen display name plus the profile cell of whoever
 * it refers to, so attribution stays correct through renames and roster
 * changes. It must never hold a `users.key(i)` handle: that follows the SLOT,
 * so removing an earlier participant would retarget it to the wrong person.
 *
 * History was briefly backed by the SQLite builtin (#4144/#4145, to dogfood it),
 * but that brought a deployed-piece "invalid database handle" failure plus a
 * stack of workarounds (a write-counter to force query re-runs, TEXT-encoded
 * timestamps, async settle races). It is now back on plain fabric storage.
 *
 * Current-day vote filter: every vote is stamped with `castAt` in `castVote`,
 * and the UI (tallies, swatches, per-option highlights, header count, logVisit
 * snapshots) only shows votes cast on the current day. Older votes stay stored
 * but hidden — the (voter, option) vote key means a re-cast overwrites the same
 * entity, so they don't accumulate. "Today" is the interval `#now/300` wish
 * (`nowTick`): the runtime's shared per-space clock, coarsened to five
 * minutes, written immediately on subscribe (and refreshed on reload), then
 * advanced on aligned boundaries — so an open tab rolls to the new day at
 * midnight on its own. It reads null until the wish resolves (shown as an
 * empty vote view and a placeholder date) and stays null on pre-#4740
 * runtimes, where the vote and visit handlers no-op rather than read an
 * ambient clock the runtime may not provide. The day boundary is the
 * runtime's local timezone (the viewer's, in the browser); two viewers in
 * different timezones can see different vote sets around midnight.

                            plain JS maps. Two reasons this shape, not a reactive
                            `ranked.map(...)`/subpattern or an inline
                            `votes.filter(...)`:
                            1. Votes are links to separate entities; the
                               top-level `tallyOptions` call resolves every
                               voter's entity (including remote ones on another
                               replica), so reading `ranked` here sees them,
                               whereas a `votes.filter` in a nested map sees only
                               the votes a replica has materialized locally.
                            2. A reactive map / subpattern re-renders its per-item
                               swatches unreliably when a remote vote updates a
                               row's voters; a single `computed` re-runs as a
                               whole when `ranked` changes (like the count above),
                               so the swatches track cross-replica votes
                               reliably. `ranked` is pre-sorted, so this also
                               gives the row order with no `order` CSS hack. */
