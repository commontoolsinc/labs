/**
 * Test: Cozy Lunch Poll - Scoped
 *
 * Exercises the scope idioms (per-space directory, per-user identity,
 * derived admin) and the core voting flows.
 *
 * Single-identity caveat (CT-1598): this file runs in one runtime with one
 * identity, so admin gating is exercised by attempting admin actions *before*
 * any join (the host pointer is unset, so `isHost` is false for everyone).
 * The real second-user cases — gating against a non-host user, host takeover,
 * cross-runtime visibility — are covered by multi-user.test.tsx.
