# CFC input-cell demo

Two patterns that put a labelled cell in front of a cf-harness run and let it
compose over one without reading it, so the console has something to draw. The
pair is the smallest arrangement that separates the two facts a per-cell label
carries: what a cell is labelled, and whether that label was derived or merely
carried in.

- **`seed.tsx`** — the cells the run is pointed at, deployed before the run
  exists. `secret` declares a confidentiality atom; `city` declares none.
- **`briefing.tsx`** — what the run composes. `briefing` mixes both cells, so
  the space derives a label for it and records the lifted function that did the
  deriving; `climate` reads only `city`, so it derives nothing.

## Running it

A local toolshed and a matched client, per
[`LOCAL_DEV_SERVERS.md`](../../../docs/development/LOCAL_DEV_SERVERS.md). Every
command below wants `-i <keyfile> -a http://localhost:8000 -s <space>`; the
space is named by name, because the console composes a URL from it.

Deploy the seed and read the address of each cell it exposes:

```sh
deno task cf piece new packages/patterns/cfc-input-cell-demo/seed.tsx \
  --root . -i "$CF_KEY" -a http://localhost:8000 -s "$CF_SPACE"

deno task cf cell get --piece "$SEED_PIECE" --select 'secret@,city@' \
  -i "$CF_KEY" -a http://localhost:8000 -s "$CF_SPACE"
```

Hand both to a run as input cells. The names are operator-authored prose and are
the whole of what the model is told each token stands for — the values
themselves never enter the prompt:

The sandbox's two CFC transport directories are named explicitly: an enforcing
run refuses to start without them rather than degrading quietly.

```sh
deno task --cwd packages/cf-harness run \
  --fabric-api-url http://localhost:8000 \
  --fabric-identity "$CF_KEY" \
  --fabric-space "$CF_SPACE" \
  --fabric-cfc-posture max-enforcement \
  --cfc-result-dir .cf-harness-console/cfc/results \
  --cfc-invocation-context-dir .cf-harness-console/cfc/invocation-context \
  --input-cell secret="$SECRET_LINK" \
  --input-cell city="$CITY_LINK" \
  --artifact-root .cf-harness-console/runs \
  --prompt "Run a Common Fabric pattern over the two cells you hold handles for.
Call run_pattern once, passing sourceText exactly as given below and wiring
secret and city to the handles of those names. Do not restate any value.

sourceText:
$(cat packages/patterns/cfc-input-cell-demo/briefing.tsx)"
```

The pattern's source rides in the prompt because it is the pattern that is
checked in — a run that composed one for itself would be demonstrating the model
rather than the labels. Source is not what the arrangement withholds; the cells
are.

`--artifact-root` points at the console's own run tree, so the console reads the
run back without being told where it is. Then open the run:

```sh
deno task --cwd packages/cf-harness console
```

## What the console shows

The `run_pattern` call reads two cells and produces one. Opening the produced
cell's chip:

- `secret` carries its declared atom, `origin: declared`.
- `city` carries no label, under a run whose snapshot was taken — which the map
  header states, so the empty chip reads as a fact about the cell rather than
  about the page.
- The result carries the atom `secret` contributed, `origin: derived`, and the
  provenance atom naming the lifted function that derived it.

That last line is the one worth checking against the second and third. A result
object's label is the join of its fields, so a confidentiality atom on its own
does not say a value was computed from something confidential. The `derived`
origin and the provenance beside it do.
