/**
 * Test Pattern: the untested system patterns
 *
 * These are load-bearing product patterns: an alternative home screen, the
 * space overview, the journal, and the mentionables inspector. Each finds its
 * data through wishes rather than through inputs, so in an empty space each
 * one has to come up with an empty view rather than fail.
 *
 * That empty view is what this pins down. Each pattern is built and its
 * rendered tree read, which is what runs the derived expressions inside it.
