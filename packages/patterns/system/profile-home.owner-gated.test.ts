// Host-embedding contract seam 7 (docs/development/HOST_EMBEDDING.md §7): pinning
// an element to a profile is authorized by OWNERSHIP, not by a trusted-UI
// gesture. The single authorized writer of profile `elements` is
// `mutateElements` in profile-home.tsx, typed `OwnerProtectedProfileWrite`
// (WriteAuthorizedBy + ownerPrincipal) with NO `uiContract`. Contrast the
// profile *create* surface (profile-create.tsx), where `uiContract` IS present
// on `TrustedProfileLink` — creating a profile is correctly gesture-gated.
//
// This asymmetry is deliberate and load-bearing: because pinning is owner-gated,
// headless (`cf piece call` into `addPiece`) and cross-pattern pin flows are
// SANCTIONED. A future change that "hardens" pinning by adding a `uiContract`
// to the profile-home write path would silently break those flows — this test
// goes red on that change.
//
// The contract is asserted against the pattern SOURCE TEXT rather than the
// transformed graph so it stays robust across transformer changes and needs no
// runtime; the markers checked (`uiContract`, `OwnerProtectedProfileWrite`,
// `TrustedProfileLink`, `addPiece`) are stable public type/handler names.
