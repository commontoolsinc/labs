// builder/pattern.ts `optIntoInSpaceMultiSpaceCommit` → runner

//
// CT-1650: the profile space is created via ANONYMOUS `inSpace()` — never
// `inSpace(name)`. A named target derives its DID from
// `fromPassphrase("common user").derive(name)` (createSession spaceName path),
// i.e. the display NAME alone, so two different users picking the same profile
// name — or one user creating two same-named profiles — collide into a single
// shared space. That named path supports the legacy space names used during
// development and nothing else, and is removed once those development-only
// spaces have been migrated (docs/plans/random-space-identities.md).
// The anonymous case instead derives the DID from this handler's
// frame cause, which carries the creating user's per-home-space input links plus
// the durable per-event id (runner.ts `createPatternFrame` cause): unique per
// user AND per creation event, stable across the cross-space-commit retry. The
// display name flows ONLY to `initialName` (editable later, independent of the
// space identity). Existing profiles keep their already-baked concrete DID link.

// `setName` — the cell's owner-protected writer — so every `#profile` reader
// (Topics, `cf profile show`, the loom lobby), which reads the stored `name`
// and runs nothing, finds the name from the moment of creation. The cell is
// initialized statically in profile-home.tsx so it keeps its identity across
// releases; a default derived from `initialName` would not (see the `name`
// initializer there), so the value is written once, here, by the creator.
//
// A second step rather than a send in `submitProfileCreation`: the child a
// handler instantiates is materialized after the handler body returns (the
// runner runs the frame's reactives as a result pattern), so inside the body
// its streams do not exist yet and a send there reaches nothing. This event
// is queued behind the create in the same runtime and runs once the create
// has committed. The profile is addressed by position: the create handler
// reads the list's length before its push and sends it here as `index`.
// Position rather than the profile's display name, because the profile's
// lifts may not have run in this runtime by the time this step does (CI's
// slower lanes reached it first and a name match failed silently), and the
// argument is not on the result (re-exporting it changes the stored-profile
// schema every embedder carries, which the pattern-update gate refuses). The
// read of the list in the create handler keeps the append in the conflict
// set, so another device's create landing first conflicts and re-runs the
// create — re-deriving the index — instead of merging under it.
//
// The list is bound as a VALUE, not a link: the runner resolves a handler's
// argument against this schema before the body runs, and a profile whose
// docs the replica has not loaded yet reads as undefined — the runner then
// withdraws the dispatch and runs it again once the loads land (scheduler
// events.ts, the cold-argument arm). Reading the new profile in the body
// instead — through its link, right after the cross-space commit — raced
// that load: the send found no stream and reached nothing. Only a profile
// whose stored `name` is still empty is written: a re-delivery of this
// event, or the same profile seeded elsewhere, is left alone.
