/**
 * End-to-end navigation of a data-heavy topic board, driven through a real
 * browser against a running toolshed.
 *
 * The micro-benchmarks elsewhere in the repository measure one component at a
 * time. This one measures what a person waits for: a cold page load of a board
 * carrying dozens of topics, signing in, the board's cards appearing, opening a
 * topic, and following a crossref from that topic to a sibling. Each of those
 * is its own benchmark, so the dashboard charts the timeline in parts as well
 * as end to end, and a regression lands on the segment that caused it.
 *
 * Two further segments measure the Topics derivations rather than the
 * navigation over them, for the browser tier of
 * `docs/plans/topics-computation-cost.md`. `comment` is a warm update: sending
 * a comment on an open topic, which moves that topic's comment count and last
 * activity. `backlink` opens the topic the most siblings cite and waits for the
 * rows its backlink derivation produces, which the `crossref` segment above
 * cannot measure — that one follows a citation outward from the topmost card,
 * and the topmost card is the newest topic, which nothing cites. Both record
 * their reads through `topics-browser-measurement.ts` alongside the interval
 * they chart.
 *
 * Every segment benchmark reaches its starting point outside the measured
 * window: the browser is launched, the board is loaded, and the earlier
 * segments are replayed with the timer stopped. Each iteration therefore
 * measures exactly one segment of a fresh navigation, and the benchmarks do not
 * depend on each other or on the order Deno runs them in.
 *
 * Requirements beyond the other bench files: a toolshed at `API_URL`, a shell at
 * `FRONTEND_URL` (which defaults to `API_URL`, where a compiled toolshed serves
 * one), and a Chrome for Astral to drive. `.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`
 * provides all three. Locally, start the dev servers and run:
 *
 *     API_URL=http://localhost:8000/ FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173/ \
 *       deno bench -A \
 *       packages/patterns/integration/topic-board-navigation.bench.ts
 *
 * Stdout carries the JSON report and nothing else, so everything this file has
 * to say goes to stderr. The board's size and the iteration count go there at
 * startup, since a run's numbers only mean something alongside them.
