/**
 * A member of the collection-naming exemplar board, read in a session that
 * never runs its board, shows the name the board's create allocated for it.
 *
 * Two client replicas share one loopback memory server, both with server
 * execution off, so each runs only what it reads. The first runs the board and
 * files two items through `addItem`, then goes away. The second opens the
 * second item by its own address, starts it, and reads its `title` and
 * `shortName`. It reads nothing of the board: not the item list, not the
 * namespace, and not the names table.
 *
 * The two-replica shape is what gives the assertion something to fail on. A
 * derived value is recomputed only where its owning piece runs and something
 * pulls it, and in one runtime a member reading its board's names table pulls
 * that table, so a pattern test in the single-runtime harness shows the name
 * whether the member stores it or looks it up. Here nothing in the second
 * replica runs the board, and nothing in the first pulled the table after the
 * creates, so a member that looked its name up in the table would read the
 * table as the first replica left it and show no name.
