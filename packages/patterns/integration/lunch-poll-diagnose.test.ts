/**
 * The lunch-poll scaling probe still drives the poll it measures.
 *
 * `tools/lunch-poll-diagnose.ts` is the scaling diagnostic for the lunch
 * poll, and nothing else runs it. Every step it drives is gated in the
 * pattern — joining needs a resolved profile, adding an option needs the
 * host, casting a vote needs a roster entry and a resolved clock — and a gate
 * that refuses writes nothing and reports nothing. A probe driving a contract
 * the pattern has moved on from therefore still finishes and still prints its
 * JSON, reporting a matrix of zeros that reads like a measurement of an idle
 * poll. This runs the smallest case the probe has and asks what it measured.
 *
 * No toolshed or browser required (Deno workers + in-process storage server).
