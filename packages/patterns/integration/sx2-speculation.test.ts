// Server-execution v2 Phase 2 gate: client speculation, live
// (testing.md §5's `sx2-speculation` — echo latency, overlay
// retirement, and the client's lost derivation-commit path). A
// PiecesController client drives the counter pattern against toolshed:
//
// - the ECHO: the actor's own edit renders locally without waiting on
//   the server round trip (speculation.md §3 — rendering reads through
//   the overlay);
// - RETIREMENT: once the replicated watermark covers the input, the
//   overlay empties (speculation.md §4) and the STORE value renders
//   through the same path;
// - the client commits NO derivation: the overlay diagnostic is the
//   client-side witness here; the store-attribution query (zero
//   `derived`-class commits from any client session) is pinned with
//   engine access in `packages/runner/test/speculation-overlay.test.ts`
//   and the admission layer refuses non-holder derived commits by
//   construction (protocol.md §2).
//
// OFF arm: the client derives and commits as today — the overlay never
// exists (byte-identical posture), asserted explicitly.
