/**
 * The allocator under real concurrency: two sessions on one memory server,
 * each running `assignName` over one collection's names map, in transactions
 * that both read the map's keys before either commits.
 *
 * The function under test is the one the pattern runtime runs.
 * `collection-naming/naming.ts` cannot be imported by plain Deno — it takes
 * `lift`, `Writable` and `equals` from `commonfabric` as values, and those are
 * ambient declarations that bind nothing outside the pattern runtime's module
 * environment — so the test compiles a fixture that re-exports `assignName`
 * through the harness and calls what comes back. That is also why this file
 * sits under `integration/`: the package's plain-Deno lane runs under
 * `test-import-map.json`, whose `commonfabric` is a stub and which maps no
 * runner entry point, while the `integration` task runs under workspace
 * resolution, where the runtime and the harness resolve.
