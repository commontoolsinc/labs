/**
 * The chained-event serve-order gate, pinned deterministically.
 *
 * A trusted action whose SERVED handler reads a precondition cell
 * written by an immediately-preceding event (draft → trusted send) is
 * racy by design under ON: events on different streams have no
 * cross-stream serve-order guarantee (events.md §2 — per stream,
 * commit-seq order; across streams, no claim), and the group-chat
 * handlers silently no-op on an empty draft
 * (`prepareTrustedMessageSend` returns null). The real UI forbids the
 * racy interleaving — the trusted control stays disabled until the
 * draft state the CLICKING session sees is non-empty — so tests must
 * gate the same way. Ungated, the race reproduced nightly under CI
 * load (2026-08-22, runs 32543810077 / 32547606642: "bob's
 * post-lockdown message arrives at alice" timing out with quiescence
 * clean and zero errors — the message was never appended, not slow).
 *
 * This file makes the race DETERMINISTIC instead of load-statistical:
 * two sessions of one user (the draft is PerUser, so both see it), the
 * draft-writing session's WebSocket delayed by 300 ms, and the draft
 * fired with `idle: false` so it is provably still in flight when the
 * other session acts. Delay injection at the racy seam — the
 * repository's standard for pinning a load flake. Ungated, this
 * topology fails 2/2 with the exact CI signature (recorded in
 * docs/history/plans/server-execution-v2/optimize/
 * arrival-wait-hardening-report.md); the two steps below pin the two
 * honest gates that close it.
