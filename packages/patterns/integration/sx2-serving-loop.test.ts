// Server-execution v2 Phase 2 gate: the serving loop, live
// (testing.md §5's `sx2-serving-loop` — counters, amplification, and
// the settle discipline). Headless: a PiecesController client drives
// the real counter pattern against toolshed; in the ON arm the
// toolshed's ExecutorHost serves the space and this test asserts the
// serving-loop gates from `/api/health/stats` COUNTERS — never logs,
// never text-polling (testing.md §3–§4):
//
// - the client settles via `waitForSettled` (the watermark doc — the
//   poll-loop replacement);
// - ONE authoritative run per upstream change, waves ≈ authored input
//   batches (ballpark, testing.md §4);
// - amplification `derivedCommits / (authoredSeen − effectAcks)` ≤ 2
//   on this pure workload (the §4 budget — a TRIGGER: a breach fails
//   with the numbers so a human inspects the why);
// - the serving loop settles against the REAL toolshed while nothing
//   follows a piece's source origin on its behalf (the plan's Phase 2
//   revisit (b)): a serving tenure opens no piece, so it fetches no
//   pattern route, and its settle must reach quiescence without one.
//   A full stale-pointer roll-forward journey stays a follow-up.
//
// OFF arm: the same workload runs client-derived (today's posture,
// byte-identical); the servingLoop stats block is absent and the
// ON-arm assertions are skipped explicitly.
