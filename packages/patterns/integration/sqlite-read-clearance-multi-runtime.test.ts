/**
 * Multi-runtime regression test: CFC Phase 3.b read-time-clearance results
 * are READER-ISOLATED (#4478 review P0, fixed in 52e3e7e7).
 *
 * Two users (alice, bob) share one space and one rule-bearing SQLite db whose
 * rows each name their intended reader. Both runtimes run the same
 * `readClearance: true` query. Before the fix the cleared result landed in a
 * SPACE-scoped result cell keyed by a reader-blind request hash, so the
 * runtime that settled second either reused the other reader's filtered rows
 * (request-hash dedup) or clobbered them with its own — cross-reader
 * disclosure either way. The fix forces the cleared result to per-`user`
 * scope and keys the request hash by the acting reader.
 *
 * Asserts:
 * - each reader's cleared query returns EXACTLY the rows naming them;
 * - `withheld` is per-reader (each reader's own audit count);
 * - the cleared result cell resolves at scope "user" (isolated instance per
 *   reader on one shared link);
 * - the two readers' cleared request hashes DIFFER, while the non-clearance
 *   query keeps ONE shared hash (non-clearance queries unchanged);
 * - two SESSIONS of one reader (alice's Identity in two harness sessions —
 *   two browser tabs) SHARE the user-granularity cleared result and its
 *   request hash: the session joins the request identity only BELOW user
 *   scope (RULED 2026-08-22, verification-coverage.md OW53), so a
 *   user-scoped cleared read stays session-blind in both arms.
 *
 * No toolshed or browser required (Deno workers + in-process storage server).
