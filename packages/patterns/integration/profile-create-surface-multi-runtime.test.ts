/**
 * Multi-runtime regression test: a `#profile` wish in a space with no profile
 * opens the real profile-create surface.
 *
 * The surface is a system pattern the runtime fetches from the host serving
 * the space, under `system:system/profile-create.tsx`. A harness that hosts
 * storage in-process and leaves that route unanswered has no way to open it,
 * so a pattern whose identity is a profile cell could only ever be driven
 * through the seams its own tests supply. Serving the patterns tree beside the
 * storage server is what closes that gap, and this is the test that says so:
 * it walks from the wish's `[UI]` node into the surface's own piece and reads
 * the name that only the compiled system pattern produces.
 *
 * No toolshed or browser required (Deno workers + in-process storage server).
