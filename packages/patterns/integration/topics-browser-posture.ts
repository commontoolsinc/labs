/**
 * The server-execution posture a browser-tier Topics measurement ran under, so
 * that every sample says either which mode produced it or that the deployment
 * declared none, as `docs/plans/topics-computation-cost.md` asks of a run
 * labeled by mode. A sample never leaves the question open, and never answers
 * it with a guess.
 *
 * The posture is read from the deployment under measurement rather than from
 * the environment the benchmark process was started with: a benchmark that
 * labeled its samples from its own `EXPERIMENTAL_SERVER_EXECUTION` would
 * label whatever it was told, including a deployment that resolved something
 * else. Two halves are read, and a run whose halves disagree is refused rather
 * than labeled, because a client and a server on opposite postures exercise
 * neither of them.
 *
 * Neither half is the worker's own report. The runtime client's protocol
 * carries no request that reads a worker's resolved flags back, so the closest
 * available statement of what the page ran is the shell it was served: the
 * shell declares its posture from the build define, and the worker refuses to
 * initialize when its resolved posture disagrees with that declaration, so a
 * page that loaded at all ran the posture its shell declared.
 *
 * The shell's half itself has two possible statements, and they are not
 * interchangeable. The bundle served to the browser is the artifact the run
 * loads, so it states this run's posture. `/api/meta` states the posture of
 * the shell its own toolshed serves, which is the same artifact only when the
 * shell came from that toolshed — the two URLs are separate parameters
 * because they can denote separate deployments. So the bundle is read
 * whenever it can be, both statements are compared when both exist, and a
 * disagreement refuses rather than picking one. Meta alone settles the
 * question only for a shell served by the toolshed that reported it.
 *
 * Reading a deployment has three outcomes, and no path labels a run from an
 * assumption. Where both halves are stated and agree, the posture is that
 * mode, carrying which statement the shell's half came from. Where both are
 * stated and disagree, reading refuses: a client and a server on opposite
 * postures exercise neither. Where the deployment states the shell's half
 * nowhere, the posture is `undeclared` — a recorded fact about the deployment
 * rather than a guess at what its shell runs, and never the first-party
 * default, which is a constant compiled into this process rather than
 * something the deployment said.
 *
 * Whether `undeclared` is acceptable belongs to the caller, because it is a
 * property of what a measurement is for. A benchmark comparing two postures
 * needs a declared one and reads through
 * {@link readDeclaredTopicsBrowserPosture}, which refuses the rest. A test
 * exercising the measurement helpers does not care what posture it ran under,
 * reads through {@link readTopicsBrowserPosture}, and carries whatever it
 * finds into its samples. A shell built without posture defines declares
 * nothing and is not thereby misconfigured.
