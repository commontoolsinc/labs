/**
 * The four actions of the Topics demo, as one continuous journey: the board
 * listing its topics, a topic opened from its own card, a backlink followed to
 * the topic that cites it, and a comment added that the thread then shows.
 *
 *     deno task demo patterns topic-board-demo
 *
 * records it. `deno task integration patterns topic-board-demo` runs the same
 * file without a recording, which is what CI does.
 *
 * ## What this holds a candidate to
 *
 * The demo exists so a change to how Topics computes can be shown working
 * before and after, which only means something if the two runs are comparable.
 * So the board comes from `seedTopicBoard` in a space of the demo's own rather
 * than from whatever a space happens to hold, and every title and citation is
 * derived from the fixture rather than written down here.
 *
 * A candidate may change, without invalidating the comparison: how the board
 * produces its crossref pivot and where that production is shared; which
 * per-topic derivations are reused; what is cached and what is computed
 * lazily; how often a lift runs; and how long any of it takes. Those are the
 * properties the plan's stages exist to move, and none of them is asserted
 * here.
 *
 * Two further properties are not asserted here either, for the opposite
 * reason — the plan constrains them, and constrains them somewhere else. The
 * order the board lists its cards in is held by the plan's compatibility
 * requirements, which preserve visible ordering; `clickCardOpenLink` addresses
 * a card by its title so that this journey does not come to rest on that
 * ordering, not because the ordering is free to move. What a view demands is
 * held by the headless read-budget tests, `topics-read-budget-*.test.ts`, and
 * this journey counts no reads at all.
 *
 * A candidate may not change, and this fails if it does: the board lists each
 * topic the fixture seeded; the Open link on a card addresses the topic that
 * card describes; a cited topic names the topic citing it, by an identity the
 * shell can select; and a comment sent through the composer is stored with its
 * author and shown in the thread. The middle two are each checked on the one
 * card and the one citation this journey passes through, which is what a
 * journey can check.
 *
 * Two counts are not asserted. Waiting for each seeded title says every one of
 * them is listed; that each is listed once and none is doubled is asserted by
 * title in `topic-board-child-contract.test.ts`. And a topic's first
 * `addComment` can commit twice under server execution, as
 * `topic-retraction-controls.test.ts` records, so the thread can hold more
 * records than this journey sent.
 *
 * Some of what the journey navigates by is rendered copy rather than behavior:
 * the `Referenced by` heading, the `Send` button's text, the one `cf-textarea`
 * a topic page carries, and the profile wish's `#wish-profile-name-input` and
 * `CreateProfile` action. The computation work touches none of them, so a
 * failure naming one is a copy or markup change in Topics or in the wish —
 * move the anchor, rather than reading it as a regression in what this shows.
