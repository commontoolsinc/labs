/**
 * Headless identity harness and keyed-address probe for the lunch poll —
 * fixture for lunch-poll-keyed-votes.test.ts.
 *
 * Two jobs, neither of which changes what the poll does.
 *
 * IDENTITY. The poll's identity is a shared `#profile` cell. In a space holding
 * no profile that wish resolves to the surface offering to create one, so a
 * session there has nothing to join or vote with until somebody uses it.
 * `claim` supplies what a resolved wish would: a
 * shared-space profile per claimed name, handed to the poll through its
 * `overrideViewer` seam. One session claims "Alice", another claims "Bob", and
 * the poll sees two participants whose identities are two distinct documents —
 * the production shape. The profile must be a document of the shared space,
 * never a per-user scoped cell: a scoped cell is one ADDRESS read through the
 * reader's own partition, so every session would store the same identity in the
 * roster and the second joiner would dedup into the first.
 *
 * ADDRESS. `probeVote` reads the vote list at the address the poll's own key
 * derivation names, and publishes what it finds as `probedVote`. That read
 * consults one entity and never the list, so it finds a vote only if the poll
 * stored it as a keyed element. The fixture holds the `votes` cell and hands it
 * to the poll so both name one document, which is what gives the probe a
 * writable handle to address elements from.
 *
 * `probedVote` is one slot shared by every session, so a test probes one
 * address at a time and reads the answer before probing the next.
