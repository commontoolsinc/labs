/**
 * Multi-runtime regression test: the sqlite db handle's `owner` is minted
 * once — by the runtime that created the handle — and must survive other
 * runtimes opening the same piece.
 *
 * The sqliteDatabase builtin re-runs its initialization in EVERY runtime that
 * opens the piece (the action's `initialized` guard is per-runtime-instance).
 * Before the fix it unconditionally rewrote the shared handle with the
 * CURRENT runtime's acting principal as `owner`, so the last opener silently
 * became the db owner. Security-relevant: `dbOwner()` row-rule terms
 * (packages/memory/v2/sqlite/row-label.ts) and `{__ctDbOwner: true}` ceiling
 * placeholders (packages/runner/src/builtins/sqlite/row-label-read.ts)
 * resolve against this field, so a rotated owner changes who may read rows.
 *
 * The piece (and thus the handle) is created by the harness's bootstrap
 * runtime acting as alice (sessions[0]); bob's runtime opens it afterwards.
 * The committed handle must keep alice as owner in BOTH runtimes' view.
 *
 * No toolshed or browser required (Deno workers + in-process storage server).
