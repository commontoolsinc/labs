/**
 * How long a room full of people voting at once takes to agree.
 *
 * Ten voters each cast a vote on each of ten lunch options, every one of the
 * hundred fired before any of them settles, and the measurement runs until
 * every one of the ten clients has the whole result. That is the quantity a
 * person actually waits on at lunchtime, and it is the one no other benchmark
 * in the repository can see: every other bench file drives a single runtime
 * against its own private storage server, where a second writer does not exist
 * and a write conflict is unreachable by construction.
 *
 * What it is sensitive to. A vote is a keyed write — `castVote` addresses one
 * vote by `(voter profile entity, option)` and adds it with `addUnique`, so a
 * commit carries no read of the vote list and two voters never collide. Written
 * instead as read-the-list, edit, write-the-list-back, every pair of votes in
 * the burst collides: each loser's optimistic write is rolled back, it waits
 * for the newer state, re-runs, and commits again. Both forms converge on the
 * same tally, which is why the pattern's own tests cannot tell them apart, and
 * why this is a benchmark rather than an assertion. The difference is entirely
 * in how long it takes and how much is thrown away getting there.
 *
 * Reading the series. One number per iteration: hundred votes dispatched, then
 * settled. On an Apple M5 Max the keyed write settles a burst in about 400ms
 * having thrown nothing away, and the same burst over a whole-list write took
 * 7 to 15 seconds and cost 430 rejected commits and 558 rolled-back writes —
 * and dropped two votes for the length of one burst on the way.
 * `packages/patterns/integration/lunch-poll-keyed-votes.test.ts` is the
 * assertion half of the same property, bounding rolled-back writes rather than
 * timing them.
 *
 * Sample count is the weak point, and it is inherent. An iteration takes about
 * 450ms on an Apple M5 Max and 2.6 seconds on a four-core CI host, so a run
 * collects eleven or twelve samples either way. The 75th percentile the
 * dashboard trend reads discards only the slowest quarter of those, so a runner
 * that stalls twice moves this line without any code changing. Read it for the
 * shape of a move across several windows, not for one window against the last.
 *
 * The setup — ten Deno workers, ten joins, ten options, and a warm-up burst —
 * runs once at module scope, outside every measurement, because it costs some
 * twelve seconds and repeating it per iteration would leave a run with almost
 * no samples. Each iteration recolors every vote, so all hundred are genuine
 * changes and the vote count holds at a hundred throughout; no iteration leaves
 * a state the next one starts from differently.
 *
 * Ten runtimes is the largest footprint of any benchmark in the job. Measured
 * on a four-core CI host with 15.6GB of memory: the whole file takes 89 seconds
 * and peaks at 4.76GB resident, which is under a third of that host and leaves
 * the rest of the job room. The peak is held to the end of the process, because
 * the workers are released at exit rather than when this file's benchmarks
 * finish, so it is a floor under everything measured after it.
 *
 * `CF_LUNCH_POLL_VOTERS` and `CF_LUNCH_POLL_OPTIONS` resize it for a local run
 * asking how the burst scales. The size is part of the measurement and names
 * the series, so changing it starts a new line rather than continuing this one;
 * CI leaves both unset. The size in force, and a contention accounting taken
 * over one untimed burst, are written to stderr and so into the run's
 * `diagnostics.log`.
 *
 * No toolshed and no browser: the harness hosts its own storage server in
 * process. The runtime inside each worker reports that it cannot compile the
 * `#profile` create surface, which is why the poll is driven through the
 * `lunch-poll-keyed-votes` fixture's own identity seam; those lines are the
 * harness's, not this file's.
