/**
 * Verifies that a piece id seen from *inside* a pattern corresponds to the same
 * piece id seen from *outside* it.
 *
 * The note pattern's `appendLink` builds a `[[name (id)]]` wiki-link whose id is
 * derived internally — `entityRefToString` over a cell's `entityId`. This test
 * invokes `appendLink` from outside the pattern and asserts the embedded id is
 * exactly `target.id`, the same piece's id as reported by `create` (the
 * runtime's external-facing identity). It thus guards against the in-pattern id
 * being self-consistent yet disagreeing with the external view — a mismatch an
 * in-pattern assertion can't catch, since it only has the same internal
 * machinery to recompute the id with.
