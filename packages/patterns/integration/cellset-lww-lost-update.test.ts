/**
 * CHARACTERIZATION of the blind-set / CAS-push trade-off accepted in #4245:
 * an array read-modify-write through `set` (the ArrayCellController
 * removeItem/updateItem shape — read the array, filter/replace, `set` the
 * whole new array) is last-write-wins. If it races a concurrent `push`, the
 * pushed element is SILENTLY clobbered: the set lands ok, no ConflictError,
 * no retry, nothing observable at the write site.
 *
 * Timeline demonstrated:
 *   shared items = [a, b, c]                      (settled everywhere)
 *   bob:   push(d)          → CAS, lands → [a, b, c, d]
 *   alice: removeItem(b) as the UI does it — she read [a, b, c] BEFORE bob's
 *          push, filters b, then blind-sets [a, c]  → lands ok (structural
 *          parent read only) → final list [a, c]:  d is gone.
 *
 * Contrast (also asserted): if alice's stale RMW goes through `push`-style
 * CAS instead, the server rejects it with a ConflictError — the loss is
 * specific to the blind path, not to racing per se.
 *
 * These tests PASS today: they pin current semantics. If they start failing,
 * the blind-vs-CAS routing changed and the removeItem/updateItem story needs
 * re-deciding (mergeable remove-by-value / a CAS CellSet variant — see the
 * #4245 discussion thread).
