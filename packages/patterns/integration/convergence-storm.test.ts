/**
 * Scoped-link / convergence coverage — multi-runtime, in-process, no browser.
 *
 * The original reader-blackout investigation exposed a write-side identity
 * defect: putting a live `PerUser` cell into shared `PerSpace` state stored a
 * scope-generic link, so another session resolved the link into its own empty
 * user partition.
 *
 * If that scoped field is required, its absent target correctly makes the
 * element and containing array fail schema validation. Callers that want the
 * remaining message fields while the target is unavailable must declare the
 * field optional. The minimal cases pin that distinction, plus the PerSpace
 * control where every reader resolves the same target.
 *
 * The storm fixture uses the optional declaration and checks observer
 * convergence under sustained writes. The independent B3 writer-integration
 * gap remains covered separately.
