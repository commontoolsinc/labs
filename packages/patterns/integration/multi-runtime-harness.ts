/**
 * Multi-runtime pattern test harness.
 *
 * Runs the same piece in SEVERAL runtimes — one per (identity, session) pair,
 * each in its own Deno Worker realm — all backed by one shared storage
 * server. This is the headless equivalent of multiple users (or multiple
 * tabs of one user) having the same piece open simultaneously, and is the
 * only way to meaningfully exercise `PerUser` / `PerSession` scoped state
 * and cross-client reactivity in a pattern test:
 *
 * - distinct identities → distinct `user:<did>` storage partitions
 * - distinct harness sessions → distinct `session:<did>:<id>` partitions
 * - `PerSpace` state is shared and propagates via subscription push
 *
 * Workers are essential, not an optimization: one JS realm cannot host two
 * runtimes (verified-load registries, frame stacks and similar module-level
 * state cross-talk), and production never does — every browser tab or CLI
 * process is its own realm. The storage server is self-hosted in-process
 * (@commonfabric/memory/v2/standalone), and serves the authored patterns tree
 * beside it, so no toolshed is needed; pass `apiUrl` to target a running
 * toolshed instead. Serving that tree is what lets a session resolve a
 * `system:` origin, and so what lets a `#profile` wish open its real create
 * surface rather than an account of why it could not.
 *
 * POSTURE (server-execution v2): the self-hosted standalone server has no
 * serving host — no ExecutorHost, no serving loop — and its engine reads
 * this realm's ambient flag, which nothing here enables. Under the ON
 * posture that combination is a MIXED topology no deployment produces:
 * the worker clients resolve `EXPERIMENTAL_SERVER_EXECUTION=true` from
 * env and send event appends, and the in-process engine's OFF-arm
 * admission refuses them deterministically ("the OFF arm has no
 * event-append admission"), so every cross-session consequence silently
 * never happens (first observed on the first CI run of the ON pattern
 * lanes, 2026-08-21). So when the environment resolves the ON posture
 * (the canonical env mapping, else the first-party default) and no
 * explicit `apiUrl` was passed, the harness targets the integration
 * environment's toolshed (`env.API_URL`) — the real ON topology, serving
 * loop included — instead of self-hosting. The OFF arm is byte-identical
 * to before: flag unset or false keeps the in-process standalone server.

   * Let all runtimes finish local work and exchange pending sync traffic. Each

   *
   * 1. Every runtime settles its own reactivity and flushes its pending commits
   *    to the server (`session.idle`).
   * 2. The in-process server drains: it applies every commit it has received
   *    and sends all pending subscription fan-out (`server.idle`).
   * 3. Every runtime forces an ordered-after round trip on its open space
   *    connections (`session.barrier`). Because a WebSocket delivers a
   *    connection's frames in order, the fan-out the server just sent has been
   *    received and applied by the time each round trip's response returns.
   * 4. Every runtime settles again, so a foreign write that just arrived and
   *    re-derives local cells has its recompute run before this round ends.
   *
   * With a running toolshed (when `apiUrl` was passed, or the ON posture
   * resolved one) there is no in-process server handle for step 2, and under
   * the ON posture the toolshed's serving loop processes this harness's event
   * appends ASYNCHRONOUSLY — a fixed round count of idle/barrier hops races
   * the drain (the OW52 shape: a 40-event pipelined storm needs ~2–3 s of
   * server time while 20 rounds complete in well under a second, so the
   * assert read a mid-drain head). Step 2's replacement is the
   * client-observable stand-in for `server.idle()`: wait until every event
   * each session fired has its terminal consequence ARRIVED back at that
   * session (speculation.md §4 step 2 — the overlay's outstanding-intent set
   * empties exactly then). CAVEAT (#6158 review F2): this covers
   * FIRST-ORDER consequences only — a server-side cascade child (an event a
   * served handler itself emits) is no session's intent and commits in a
   * LATER wave, outside the wait; cascades ride the ordinary barrier rounds,
   * so a test asserting on cascade results still needs enough rounds (or a
   * `waitFor`). The wait shares ONE budget across the whole `settle()`
   * call, so a genuinely wedged consequence degrades to the old behavior
   * (the caller's assert speaks) instead of hanging the harness — LOUDLY:
   * exhausting the budget with intents still outstanding warns once, so a
   * red assert after it self-identifies as budget exhaustion (a slow
   * serving drain) rather than re-opening the OW52 loss triage. The
   * barrier then pulls each replica to a head ≥ every first-order
   * consequence commit. Instant on an OFF-posture toolshed run (no
   * overlay, no outstanding intents).
