/**
 * That the browser's retraction controls stamp the records the reader is
 * looking at.
 *
 * The thread and the link list render from a `computed()` that drops stamped
 * records and sorts what is left, and each row's control is bound to an
 * element of that view. Binding it wrongly is a silent failure rather than a
 * loud one: a control that stamped a copy would leave the topic unchanged
 * while the click still looked as though it had worked, so what has to be
 * asserted is the STORED record, not the row leaving the page.
 *
 * The discriminating step is the second click. After the middle comment is
 * retracted the view holds the first and the last, while the stored array
 * still holds all three with the middle one stamped. Clicking the second
 * control again therefore separates two bindings that agree until then: bound
 * to the view it retracts the LAST comment, and bound to the underlying array
 * position it would find the already-stamped middle one and do nothing. A test
 * that only ever retracted the first row could not tell those apart.
 *
 * view-identity.test.tsx pins the model property this stands on — that an
 * element of such a view keeps the identity of the record it came from — and
 * topics-rejections.test.tsx holds the negative half, where a structural copy
 * of a real record is refused. This file is what says the SHIPPED controls are
 * bound to it.
