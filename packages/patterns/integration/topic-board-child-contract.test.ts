/**
 * What a caller can still observe about a topic it filed through the board,
 * once the board demands only the fields it renders.
 *
 * These three properties were pattern tests until the board's `topics` demand
 * narrowed. A pattern test can only reach a stored topic through the holder's
 * projection, and that projection no longer carries verbs, threads, or the
 * mention graph — so the properties stopped being observable there. They are
 * observable here, because this is the move the design says a caller makes:
 * survey the board, resolve the row to the topic's own address, and read or
 * call the topic itself, where its own schema governs.
 *
 * Each `it()` therefore guards a property of `addTopic`'s children that nothing
 * else can: that the child is wired to the board's mention pivot, that a body
 * given at create is not recorded as a body update, and that the board's index
 * row tracks the child's thread after the fact.
