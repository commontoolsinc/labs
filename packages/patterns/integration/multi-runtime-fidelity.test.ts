/**
 * The multi-runtime harness carries a `FabricValue` whole, in both directions.
 *
 * Each runtime lives in its own worker realm, so every command and every
 * answer crosses `postMessage`. Both cross as a `codec-realm` encoding, which
 * is what lets a test write the whole `FabricValue` domain into a pattern and
 * read back what it wrote. The two cases below fail differently without it:
 * structured cloning strips a fabric instance to `{}` on the way in, and a
 * JSON round trip flattens a weird number on the way out.
 *
 * No toolshed or browser required (Deno workers + in-process storage server).
