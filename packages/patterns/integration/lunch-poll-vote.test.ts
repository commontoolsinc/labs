/**
 * Multi-browser voting test for the lunch poll.
 *
 * Drives two simultaneous browser profiles (separate identities, same piece):
 * a host who joins first and adds options, and a second user who joins and
 * votes. Each user joins profile-first — creating their shared profile through
 * the `#profile` wish's create surface rendered inside the join card — since
 * the poll's identity IS the profile cell and there is no typed-name path. It
 * exercises the path the headless multiUserTest cannot — real DOM
 * event provenance through cf-button, login, and live cross-browser propagation
 * — and checks that two users voting on the SAME option end up with both votes
 * counted: the tally reaches "2 love it" on both browsers. The two greens are
 * cast CONCURRENTLY (both clicks dispatched before either side settles), so the
 * second voter is not guaranteed to have observed the first vote, and the votes
 * are distinct entities (one per voter), so "2 love it" requires two surviving
 * votes rather than one double-counted one.
 *
 * The deterministic stale-base no-clobber proof — where the second writer
 * commits against a base that provably lacks the first vote — lives in the
 * runner-level packages/runner/test/array-push-mergeable.test.ts, which can pin
 * the base exactly. This test is the end-to-end smoke that the same behavior
 * holds through the browser stack.
