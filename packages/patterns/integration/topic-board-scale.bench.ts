/**
 * How the cost of showing a board grows with the number of topics on it.
 *
 * `topic-board-navigation.bench.ts` measures one board of one size, which
 * catches a regression but says nothing about shape: a change that is flat at
 * thirty topics and quadratic at three hundred looks the same there. This file
 * measures the same thing — a signed-in cold load, timed until every card has
 * rendered — across several board sizes, so the shape of the curve is a thing
 * the dashboard charts rather than a thing somebody has to go and measure.
 *
 * The boards carry no crossrefs. Citations are what the board can least afford
 * (see `DEFAULT_CITING_TOPICS` in `topic-board-fixture.ts`), and a scaling
 * measurement wants the cost of the list itself, not of the join over it.
 *
 * A second series per size measures a reopen, for the browser tier of
 * `docs/plans/topics-computation-cost.md`: a topic that this page has already
 * opened once, opened again. It asks whether reaching one topic costs more as
 * the board behind it grows, which is the question this file exists for and
 * which the navigation benchmark's single board cannot answer. Reopening writes
 * nothing, so both series share each size's one seeded board.
 *
 * Requirements and stdout discipline are the same as the navigation benchmark:
 * a toolshed at `API_URL`, a shell at `FRONTEND_URL`, a Chrome for Astral, and
 * nothing but the JSON report on stdout.

 * board's own list: on an Apple M3 Max, thirty topics take 33 seconds and
 * 0.95GB of peak resident memory, sixty take 143 seconds and 1.6GB, and a
 * hundred take 274 seconds and 2.6GB.
 *
 * Memory is what binds rather than time. It is close to linear at roughly 26MB

 * — while time extrapolates to several hours. Ten thousand is out of reach on
 * both counts. Neither limit belongs to this benchmark, and neither is caused
 * by crossrefs: these boards carry none, creating the same topic pieces without
 * a board is linear and flat in memory, and attaching them to one in a single
 * write is refused by the board's element schema.
