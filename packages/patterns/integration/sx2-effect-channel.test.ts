// Server-execution v2 Phase 4 gate: the client-effect channel, live
// (testing.md §5's `sx2-effect-channel`). A PiecesController client
// drives the sx2-navigate fixture's `go` stream against toolshed:
//
// - the SERVED navigateTo (builtins.md §4's split contract): the fire
//   commits ONLY the event; the SpaceServer computes the target and
//   writes the §5 intent into the FIRING session's effects instance,
//   which the client reads back through its OWN subscription (the
//   instance resolves from the authenticated session — the client
//   names no key, T2.Q3);
// - OPTIMISTIC-ENACT RECONCILE (T2.Q7): the flag-ON client's
//   speculative run enacts the navigation immediately, carrying the
//   same deterministic nonce — the authoritative intent CONVERGES on
//   it and the journey ends with exactly ONE navigation;
// - ACK + RETIREMENT (protocol.md §5): the channel acks by nonce (an
//   ordinary authored write of the session's own `acks[nonce]` mark)
//   and the next wave retires the acked entry — the instance drains,
//   and nothing resurrects.
//
// OFF arm: navigateTo runs client-side exactly as today — the
// navigation enacts locally and NO effects doc exists anywhere.
//
// The RELOAD-between-intent-and-ack journey (LT8) lives in the runner
// suite (`executor-effect-channel.test.ts`), where the runtime can be
// torn down over a persisted session; this surface cannot reload its
// controller (a fresh controller is a fresh session until protocol
// §5's client-side session persistence lands — OW20's trigger).
