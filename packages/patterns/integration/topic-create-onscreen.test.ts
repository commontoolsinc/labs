/**
 * What one more topic costs, with and without a browser rendering the board.
 *
 * Two boards in one space, filled one topic at a time in lockstep: the browser
 * is routed at the first and never at the second, so a pair of measurements
 * taken back to back differ only in whether a live view had to keep up. The
 * alternation is what makes the pair readable on a machine whose background
 * load drifts — batching one board and then the other would charge the second
 * for whatever else the machine started doing meanwhile.
 *
 * Each on-screen create is split where the work changes hands: the write and
 * the authoring runtime's settle, then the additional wait until the new card's
 * title is in the browser's DOM. So the same run answers both "does a live view
 * slow the write down" and "how long after the write does the card appear".
 *
 * `CF_TOPICS_ONSCREEN_SIZE` sets how many topics each board ends up with, and
 * `CF_TOPICS_ONSCREEN_RENDER=0` is the control: the browser sits on the space
 * root and renders neither board, so the same run says what the harness costs
 * with nothing on screen and the rendered run is read against it.
 * `CF_TOPICS_ONSCREEN_DEMAND` decides what the authoring client holds live
 * while it files — the one knob here that can make the harness measure itself
 * rather than the product.
 *
 * Measurements are emitted as single parseable lines carrying the index they
 * were taken at, so a sweep across sizes can be collected without re-reading
 * logs by eye.
