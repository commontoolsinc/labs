// picked up once it returns rather than aimed at mid-shift.
//
// The point is measured here rather than by the test process because the two
// used to be separated by several protocol round trips, and the page is free to
// rebuild in that gap. What it rebuilt away was the very control the wait had
// just declared settled, so the measurement found no box and the click reported

// caller placed it a moment ago, so its absence means the control it names was
// replaced, which no amount of further waiting resolves. `remarkSource`, when
// the caller supplies it, is the mark predicate's own source; running it again
// re-establishes the mark on whatever control took the old one's place, so a
// rebuilt surface is clicked rather than reported.
//

 * Click the element whose click marks contain the token, then clear that mark.

 * target through its own predicate, and the aim/click/untag tail is the same
 * for all of them.
 *
 * One wait settles the control and measures where to click it. The point is
 * measured again in one page turn immediately before the trusted click, after
 * any interaction observer has finished. A moved or missing target goes
 * through the same settle and replacement handling before dispatch.
 *
 * That last measurement still crosses the protocol before the mouse events do,
 * and the page keeps running while it does, so a surface that relays out in
 * that crossing carries the control off the point the click is aimed at. The
 * aim leaves an interceptor watching for the interaction it armed for: one that
 * does not reach the marked control is stopped at the window, so the control
 * was not activated and it can be aimed at and clicked again where it now
 * stands. The loop ends on the first click the control receives, so the control
 * is activated exactly once.
 *
 * Clicking again requires a pixel no dispatch has lost yet. A control that has
 * not moved is dispatched at the same pixel, and a page that shuffles a control
 * around a few positions comes back to one of them, so both stop at the second
 * dispatch that repeats itself rather than dispatching forever. What is
 * reported then names every pixel tried and what the click reached at each.
