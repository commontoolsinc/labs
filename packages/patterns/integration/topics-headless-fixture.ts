/**
 * Synthetic Topics data, and reach into the unmodified Topics sources, for
 * measuring the board's mention pivot and a topic's backlink, comment-count,
 * and activity lifts in one process with no browser and no server.
 *
 * A fixture is written straight to storage as one linked document per topic
 * and the board's list of links to them. Nothing goes through the board's
 * `addTopic`, so a fixture's size and mention graph are chosen by its options
 * rather than by what seeding a board can afford. The lifts are reached by
 * authored name through the runtime's artifact index, and each lift's runs are
 * attributed to it by the authored source the scheduler reports for them. A
 * measurement starts the lifts one demand workload names, and records reads
 * over its initialization, over each update written to it afterward, and over
 * reopening its storage in a fresh runtime.
 *
 * Every value is derived from the options, so fixtures built from equal
 * options hold equal data, and counts taken in separate runtimes compare.
