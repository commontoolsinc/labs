/**
 * Browser-tier measurement of one operation on a Topics board, for
 * `docs/plans/topics-computation-cost.md`: reactive-body reads for the board's
 * pivot and for each topic's backlink, comment-count, and activity lifts,
 * scheduler graph size, and timing split between the main thread and the
 * worker as far as the shell's timing records that split.
 *
 * `measureTopicsReads()` turns telemetry and body read accounting on around the
 * operation, so its elapsed time carries their overhead.
 * `timeTopicsOperation()` turns both off, for an interval a benchmark times.
 * Neither records transaction-attempt reads; {@link ATTEMPT_READS_NOTE} says
 * why. Both need the runtime client that signing in creates, so neither
 * brackets cold initialization, and a sample whose client is replaced during
 * the operation fails.
 *
 * A measured sample attributes runs to lifts by position, against a
 * {@link TopicsProgram} that {@link prepareTopicsProgram} compiles from the
 * sources the board was seeded from. It requires the board to run that
 * program's module identities, without coverage instrumentation, and each
 * lift's preview to equal the first characters of its compiled text. The
 * decisions that need no page are in `topics-browser-measurement-core.ts`.
