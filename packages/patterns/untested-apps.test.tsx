/**
 * Test Pattern: the app patterns that had no test of their own
 *
 * Each of these lives in a directory of its own and is a whole small
 * application: an activity log, an agent console, a router, three chat
 * patterns built on scoped or shared profiles, a voice note, two policy demos,
 * and a regression repro kept to pin down runtime behavior. None of them had a
 * test, so nothing built any of them outside a browser.
 *
 * scope-bug-computed-vnode-blank is left out. It is a harness whose enabled
 * section exists to produce a runtime error on purpose, so a passing test
 * cannot contain it.
 *
 * Every one finds its data through wishes rather than through inputs, so in an
 * empty space each has to come up with an empty view rather than fail. This
 * builds each one, checks the name it goes under, and reads its rendered tree,
 * which is what runs the derived expressions inside it.
