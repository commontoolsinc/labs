/**
 * Test Pattern: contacts, and the two record patterns it creates
 *
 * Contacts is a list of contact pieces with two buttons above it: one adds a
 * person, the other adds a family member. Each button instantiates the
 * matching record pattern and pushes the new piece onto the list. Person and
 * family member both title themselves from the name they hold.
 *
 * This drives the list through both buttons and checks the count and title
 * that come back. Person and family member are also instantiated on their own,
 * so their forms are built and read, and a person's name is edited through the
 * same cell the form writes to, to see the title follow.
