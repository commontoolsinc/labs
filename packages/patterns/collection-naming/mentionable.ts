 * here knows what kind of piece a member is either — a member is read for three
 * display strings and carried onward as a reference.
 *
 * The universe is one document of COPIES, and that is what separates it from a
 * survey index whose rows ARE the members. A survey reads its members anyway;
 * the universe is read by EVERY member's editor, so wiring it to the members
 * would multiply the collection by itself, and one document of copies is what
 * bounds that product.
 *
 * `shortName` is copied off the member's own — the property `naming.ts` gives
 * it — so a member's number is derived once and reads the same wherever the
 * collection shows it. A collection that numbers its members without showing
 * the numbers asks for rows without them, and every row then carries the empty
 * name. `docs/common/conventions/mentionable.md` is the contract both editors
 * consume this through.

/**
 * A collection's mention universe, derived once for the whole collection:
 * every member's editor autocompletes over this one document of copies rather
 * than over the members themselves, so a universe read is one document however
 * many members the collection holds.
 *
 * The parameter is an array of CELLS for two reasons: the cell is the identity
 * each row's `piece` records, and a cell always writes as a link, so an
 * unchanged collection recomputes to the same rows and writes nothing. What it
 * declares is the ceiling on the walk — three display strings per member — so
 * the derivation expands no member's prose, thread, verbs, or rendered view.
 *
 * `shortName` is declared OPTIONAL rather than defaulted, which is a fact
 * about the compatibility proof: a default below an array constraint is one
 * the proof cannot show stable under default insertion, while an optional
 * property carries no default to move. That is the bound on what the spelling
 * buys, and it is about the READ: `cf piece setsrc` refuses a member demand
 * that gains any property at all — optional included — over a collection
 * whose stored members do not publish it, because the schema recorded on the
 * retained link is unconstrained at that path. Finding 1 of
 * `docs/history/plans/collection-naming-s6-backfill-rehearsal-2026-09-05.md`
 * measured that refusal against an optional string and an optional `unknown`
 * alike. A member that publishes none contributes a row carrying the empty
 * string, which `mentionableRowsOf` coalesces.
 *
 * `withShortNames` is for a collection that numbers its members but does not
 * show the numbers: `false` gives every row the empty name, so the collection's
 * editors offer no member for a `#42` query and show no number on a mention's
 * pill. Absent, each row carries its member's own.
