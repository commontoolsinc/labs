 *
 * The universe is one document of COPIES, and that is what separates it from a
 * survey index whose rows ARE the members. A survey reads its members anyway;
 * the universe is read by EVERY member's editor, so wiring it to the members
 * would multiply the collection by itself, and one document of copies is what
 * bounds that product.
 *
 * `shortName` is copied off the member's own — the property `naming.ts` gives
 * it — so a member's number is derived once and reads the same wherever the
 * collection shows it. `docs/common/conventions/mentionable.md` is the contract
 * both editors consume this through.
