/**
 * A member namespace for a collection pattern: the table that gives each
 * member its name by identity, the backfill that names what the collection
 * held before it numbered anything, the declaration the collection publishes
 * so a consumer learns the policy rather than assuming one, and — re-exported
 * from `allocator.ts`, so that one import reaches the whole namespace — the
 * allocator its create verb calls. Nothing here knows what kind of piece a
 * member is: a member is a cell, compared by identity and never read through.
 *
 * The namespace is one map cell on the collection, `{ "42": <member> }`,
 * written one key at a time. A name is a decimal string, dense from `1`, one
 * more than the largest name present, and never reused: a member keeps its
 * name whatever happens to it, and an entry outlives the member's place in the
 * collection's list. Concurrent allocations serialize through the runtime's
 * commit retry. A keyset read of the map conflicts with a key write to it
 * (`docs/specs/memory-v2/08-conflict-granularity.md`), so of two verbs that
 * read the same keys, the second to commit is rejected, re-runs against the
 * first one's write, and takes the next name.
 *
 * The split from `allocator.ts` is by what a declaration needs at runtime.
 * Nothing there takes a `commonfabric` value, so a plain `deno test` can
 * import it; the readers and lifts here take `lift`, `equals` and `Writable`,
 * which are ambient declarations binding nothing outside the runtime, so a
 * declaration reaching for one of those belongs in this module.
 *
 * `docs/specs/collection-naming.md` is the design this implements.
