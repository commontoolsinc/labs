/**
 * A test-only board whose members are the real Topic pattern, wired through the
 * naming library the way the exemplar board is. It holds the library to a
 * member pattern it does not own — allocation on create, the backfill over a
 * list filed before the board numbered anything, the names table giving a topic
 * its name by identity, and a topic's own lookup over that table — through a
 * board that is not the Topics board, so the library keeps its own coverage
 * over topics however the Topics board changes.
 *
 * The lookup here is driven from OUTSIDE the member, over the list position's
 * cell. What a topic does with its own `shortName` belongs to the Topics board
 * and is covered in `../topics/naming.test.tsx`.
