/**
 * What the exemplar's item actually RENDERS into its body editor: that the
 * board's mention universe reaches `$mentionable` populated, and that each
 * entry carries the two properties the completion needs — the display name
 * `cf-code-editor` declares as required, and the `shortName` a `#42` query
 * matches.
 *
 * This is the stage's headline wiring, and every other test in this directory
 * stops one step short of it: `board.test.tsx` proves the board PUBLISHES the
 * universe, and the item's own render assertions predate the universe
 * entirely. A row projection that dropped `shortName`, or an item that stopped
 * binding `$mentionable` on its editor, leaves both of those green and the `#`
 * trigger dead.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT CATCH, two things, and the second is why the member below
 * is composed rather than taken off the board. A pattern test sees the cell,
 * not the component's schema-filtered view of it, so narrowing the universe to
 * a projection the component would reject still reads whole here; only a
 * browser test crosses that boundary, which is the gap
 * `topics/render-shape.test.tsx` records after walking into it. And
 * `addItem`'s own argument list is out of reach: a created item is published
 * through the board's row demand, which carries no `[UI]` and no verbs, so
 * nothing here can open the editor of an item the board built. The member
 * below is composed with exactly what `addItem` passes it, which holds the
 * item's side of that contract and leaves the board's side to review.
 *
 * Deliberately its own file, as the Topics one is: it touches the board's
 * create verb and nothing else, so it keeps compiling while a demand-narrowing
 * change is in flight — which is exactly when a render contract needs
 * guarding.
