 * per-member demand that gains any property at all — optional included — over
 * a universe whose stored entries do not publish it, because the schema
 * recorded on the retained link is unconstrained at that path.
 *
 * These three are deliberately the WHOLE demand. A board's universe row
 * carries its item as a `piece` reference besides them, and leaving that out
 * of this projection is what keeps every walk under an item's argument out of
 * the sibling items: a property the declared demand does not select is
 * invisible to the walks that warm and watch the argument. The editor reaches
 * `piece` through its own declared contract instead, at the moment a
