/**
 * Authored-pattern coverage for the browser-driven integration suites.
 *
 * The pattern's statements execute in the shell's runtime Web Worker, which has
 * no filesystem, so the hits have to come back across two boundaries before this
 * process can write LCOV: the worker's (a `GetPatternCoverage` request) and the
 * browser's (a `page.evaluate`). The worker accumulates hits locally and hands
 * over the whole report, rather than reporting each hit as it happens, so both
 * boundaries are crossed once per runtime, immediately before the shell drops
 * that runtime and the collector inside it. A shell drops one whenever the page
 * navigates and whenever an identity is set on it, so one suite has as many
 * dumps to take as it has runtimes.
 *
 * See docs/development/COVERAGE.md.
