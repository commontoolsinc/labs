/**
 * A one-line summary of a thrown value, for the first line of a failure
 * message.
 *
 * An `Error` is summarized by its message, or by its name where it carries no
 * message. A page exception does not arrive as an `Error`: the browser
 * protocol reports it as a detail record, whose `exception.description` holds
 * the error's name, its message, and its stack, as the page renders them. Its
 * first line is the name and the message, which is the summary wanted here.
 *
 * Anything else is rendered inline, its top level only, because stringifying it
 * would read as "[object Object]". The summary stands on its own: a caller
 * that attaches the value as its error's cause adds the full detail, and a
 * caller reporting a failure it does not own has nowhere to defer to.
