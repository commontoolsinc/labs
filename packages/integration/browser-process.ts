/**
 * The browser a caller drives: how it is spawned, and how it is stopped in a
 * way the caller can wait out.
 *
 * Chrome recreates the directory `--user-data-dir` names, every missing parent
 * included, whenever it writes into it. Its rendering and utility processes
 * can keep writing after the browser process exits, so removing the profile
 * must wait for those writers too. `Deno.ChildProcess.status` covers one
 * process.
 *
 * Both output pipes are drained until their inherited write ends close.
 * Chrome's installed updater is excluded from these launches: its detached
 * services can retain the pipes independently of the browser's profile.
 * Piping both also keeps the browser's output out of the caller's own,
 * which a spawn leaves inherited for any stream it asks no pipe
 * for. The browser is spawned here and astral attached to the running browser,
 * which is what keeps those pipes in reach.
