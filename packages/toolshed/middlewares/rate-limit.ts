/**
 * Rate limiting keyed by CLIENT ADDRESS.
 *
 * Not by caller DID: a DID is a free, freshly-generated keypair, so every
 * bucket would start full. `X-Forwarded-For` is consulted only when the
 * deployment declares a trusted proxy (`RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_FORWARDED_FOR`),
 * because there is no way to tell a proxy-set header from a client-set one —
 * and either mistake is total. Trusting a spoofable header makes the limiter a
 * no-op; ignoring a real proxy collapses every caller onto one bucket and lets
 * one client starve the deployment.
 *
 * The RIGHTMOST entry, not the leftmost. A proxy APPENDS the address it saw to
 * whatever the request already carried, so the leftmost entry is whatever the
 * client sent — a caller who sets `X-Forwarded-For: <anything>` gets a fresh
 * full bucket on every request, which is the limiter not existing. The
 * rightmost entry is the one the trusted proxy itself wrote, and it is the only
 * entry in the header the client could not choose.
 *
 * This assumes exactly ONE trusted proxy appends. Behind a chain of N, the
 * client-controlled prefix extends N-1 entries further right, and this needs to
 * count in by the number of trusted hops instead.
