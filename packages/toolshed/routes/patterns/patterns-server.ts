 * The patterns route this deployment serves: the authored patterns tree, plus
 * each connector-owned tree at its stable route prefix.
 *
 * The route itself — its URL prefix, what `?identity` answers, and the caching
 * headers around both — is the runner's, not this route file's. A pattern's
 * content identity folds in each module's authored path, and the worker names
 * modules by their URL pathname (HttpProgramResolver), so an answer that
 * differed from the runner's own would be one no runtime could adopt.
