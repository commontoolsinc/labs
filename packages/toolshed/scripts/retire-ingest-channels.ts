// Mass-revoke ingest channels — the operator lever for a trust event.
//
// Why this is a script and not a runtime concept:
//
// A minted token is a durable append capability that outlives the conditions
// which authorized it. The forcing case is the fix to passphrase-derived space
// keys: until that lands, anyone who knew a space NAME could sign as that
// space, grant themselves OWNER, and mint entirely legitimately. Fixing the
// derivation stops new abuse and retracts nothing already issued.
//
// The tempting design is a "trust epoch" stamped on every registration and
// compared on every POST. That buys a declarative, atomic cutover — and pays
// for it with a field, an env var, and a hot-path branch that live forever to
// serve an event that happens once. Not worth it.
//
// Revocation already does the job, and it is already the right shape: it is
// fail-closed (the data plane refuses a revoked channel even with a valid
// token), it is loud (a correct token gets an actionable 403 telling the device
// to re-pair, not a blank 401), and it retains the registration as an audit
// record. Retiring a population is therefore just "revoke all of it" — a
// deliberate operator action, at a moment of the operator's choosing.
//
// Re-minting is the manual conversion: an owner runs `cf ingest mint` again,
// which re-authorizes the channel under the new conditions and clears the
// revocation while preserving its history.
//
// TRADE-OFF, stated so it is a known property rather than a surprise: this is
// imperative, so it is not atomic. A channel minted between the run and the
// cutover is missed. Re-run it (it is idempotent) or take the control plane
// down for the migration, and use `audit-ingest-channels` to confirm.
//
// Usage:
//   deno task retire-ingest-channels --reason "space-key-derivation-fix"
//   deno task retire-ingest-channels --reason "..." --confirm
//
// Dry run by default; nothing is written without --confirm.
