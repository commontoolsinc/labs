// List every ingest channel this deployment has minted.
//
// Why: a minted token is a durable append capability into a user's space, and
// the registration lives in the toolshed's own service space where no user can
// see it. Without this, "what have we handed out, to whom, and is any of it
// still in use" is unanswerable — which matters most on the day the answer
// determines what has to be retired (see `retire-ingest-channels.ts`).
//
// This is the only production reader of the global registration index, which
// exists precisely so channels are enumerable for audit.
//
// Usage:
//   deno task audit-ingest-channels                  # human-readable
//   deno task audit-ingest-channels --json           # machine-readable
//   deno task audit-ingest-channels --repair-indexes # backfill by-space index
//   deno task audit-ingest-channels --repair-indexes --recover known.txt
//                                                    # also visit channels the

 * enumerating that same index only ever finds what is already there. It cannot
 * be a scan of the service space either: the memory layer exposes no
 * space-wide enumeration, and reaching into its SQLite internals from an
 * operator script would couple the Operation layer to Foundation internals
 * that are actively changing.
 *
 * It does not need to be. A channel id is `channelId(space, installId)` —
 * derived, not random — and `provision-ingest-channel.ts` is the only thing
 * that ever created one, from arguments the operator chose. So the operator's
 * own provisioning record IS the source of truth, and probing it is exact: an
 * id either resolves to a registration or it does not.
 *
 * Blank lines and `#` comments are ignored so a hand-kept file can be
