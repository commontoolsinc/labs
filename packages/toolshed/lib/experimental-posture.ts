/**
 * The experimental-flag posture this server runs at, published on `/api/meta`
 * so a client that is not built alongside it can adopt the deployment's flags
 * instead of being configured to match by hand
 * (`docs/development/EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS.md`, "Clients that are not built
 * alongside their server").
 *
 * Held here rather than read off the Runtime at request time because the meta
 * route is part of the app and the Runtime is constructed by the process that
 * serves it: reaching for the instance would make the route import the
 * server's entry point. The startup path publishes what the Runtime ACTUALLY
 * resolved, so what a client reads is the effective posture — built-in
 * defaults and preset resolution included — never a second reading of the
 * environment that could disagree with the first.
 *
 * Two halves, because a serving process runs two kinds of runtime: the
 * generic one this toolshed constructs for webhook pattern execution, whose
 * resolved flags are the base, and the per-space SERVING runtimes the
 * executor host builds under server-execution, which force a posture of their
 * own on top. The base alone would tell a client the deployment runs flags it
 * does not.
 *
 * Module state, and one process serves one deployment; the tests that publish
 * a posture reset it, because nothing else would.
