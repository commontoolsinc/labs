// What caused the requests toolshed sends to the LLM gateway.
//
// The gateway attributes spend by the `x-cf-harness-*` headers a caller sends.
// It copies them into its access log and then removes them from the request,
// so a model vendor sees none of them. Both steps work from an explicit list
// of header names, which is why the fields here are the ones
// `@commonfabric/cf-harness/provenance` already defines: a name outside that
// list reaches the vendor and appears in no log.
//
// Only requests to the gateway carry these values. The other providers in
// `routes/ai/llm/models.ts` address a vendor's own API, with nothing in front
// of it to strip a header, so they carry none of this.
