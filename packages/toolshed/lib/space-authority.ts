// Is a verified caller entitled to act on a space, and can this deployment
// actually deliver if it is?
//
// This is the answer to the `TODO(auth)` in middlewares/first-party-http-auth.ts:
// that middleware authenticates a `did:key` and stops. Everything below turns an
// authenticated principal into an AUTHORIZED one, against the record that already
// governs space access — the space's own ACL document at `of:<space DID>`
// (memory/v2/server.ts `aclDocId`). No new trust root, no new proof format: the
// strength here is inherited from the memory ACL, so it tightens as the platform
// tightens (see docs/features/self-serve-ingest-channels.md).
//
// TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, TWO DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT RESOLUTIONS
//
//   1. "Is the CALLER entitled?" — a security decision. Resolved NARROWLY:
//      `acl[caller] === "OWNER"`, an explicit concrete grant. No wildcard
//      fallback, no `principal === space` branch, no service-DID branch.
//   2. "Can the OPERATOR write?" — a PREDICTION of what the memory server will
//      do, used to fail loudly at mint instead of silently at ingest. Resolved
//      PERMISSIVELY via `spaceReaderRole`, which mirrors the server's own
//      resolution (wildcard fallback and service DIDs included) because here
//      permissive == accurate.
//
// Using the permissive oracle for (1) would be a real vulnerability:
// `spaceReaderRole` resolves `acl[principal] ?? acl["*"]`, so an ACL of
// `{alice:"OWNER","*":"OWNER"}` — reachable via `cf acl set ANYONE OWNER` —
// makes EVERYONE an owner. That is tolerable for the render fit it was written
// for (§4.9.3: over-blocking/over-admitting a value the caller could already
// read) and unacceptable when the consequence is minting durable write
// authority into someone's space.

 * ACL, a space whose ACL is malformed/ownerless, and a space where the caller
 * simply is not an owner. Splitting them would hand any keypair holder an
 * existence oracle over the deployment's entire space inventory — and since

 * fires when the toolshed operator cannot even READ the target space's ACL, so
 * ownership can never be evaluated — the chicken-and-egg case where withholding
 * the reason would leave a legitimate owner with no diagnostic at all. This is
 * safe because it is a GLOBAL deployment property, not a per-space secret: an
 * operator holding `MEMORY_SERVICE_DIDS` authority has implicit OWNER on every
 * space, so a correctly-configured deployment returns this for NO space and the
 * response is constant. It becomes differential only under per-space operator
 * grants — a configuration this feature explicitly does not recommend, and on
 * which this error is the thing you most need to see.
