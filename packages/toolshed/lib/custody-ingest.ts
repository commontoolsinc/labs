/**
 * The one durable-write path for the fabric's external-ingest edges. An outside
 * service with no DID deposits data into the fabric; a vouched ingest channel
 * marks every value it writes with an unforgeable `ExternalIngest` provenance
 * stamp.
 *
 * This replaces the per-route, hand-rolled durable-write blocks
 * (`oauth2-common.utils.ts` persistTokens/clearAuthData, the divergent
 * non-retry `plaid-oauth.utils.ts` saveAuthData) and the webhook's
 * fire-and-forget `sendToStream` (a transient overwrite, not a durable append)
 * with a single governed write. `custodyIngest.*` adds the provenance mark for
 * the ingest edges; `durableSet` / `durableUpdate` are the same governed write
 * for operator actions that are NOT ingest (clearing tokens, removing an item),
 * which must not carry the mark.
 *
 * The split-mint runs here: the payload is written under the ordinary member
 * identity (so the runtime gate strips any provenance atom an attacker smuggled
 * into it), while `stampExternalIngest` hands the commit pipeline only the
 * *verified channel metadata* — channel, audience, receive time, and a digest
 * of the bytes we wrote — from which it mints the trusted mark. The two never
 * share an authoring identity. See
 * docs/development/proposals/vouched-ingest-channel-mint-design.md.
 *
 * Honest limit: v1 is operator-trusted. This runtime is `as: identity` and sees
 * the plaintext; the split-mint protects the *mark*, not the *bytes*.
