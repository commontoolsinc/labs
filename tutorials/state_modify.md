# Modifying State

## Introduction

In the last section, we learned how to create state via `Cell`s and also
how to create derived states.
We used building a fantasy game character sheet as an example.
We'll continue with that to learn how to modify state.

## Handling User Input

Let's start with changing our character's name.
We'll need to add a text input field in the `[UI]` section.
We can't just use regular HTML components.
The Common Tools runtime has its own JSX components to
make sure data is protected and not accessed by
other scripts.

```{code-block} typescript
:label: state_send_message_placeholder
:linenos: false
:emphasize-lines: 
    <common-send-message
      name="Update"
      placeholder="Update Name"
      // we need to fill out the event listener attribute below
      // onmessagesend= 
    />
```

If you deploy this update, you'll see an input field, but nothing happens
when you enter data. As the comments indicate, we
need to fill out code for the onmessagesend JSX event listener.

This is when we learn about `handler`.
A `handler` is a Common Tools runtime component that, like its name
suggests, handles events.
The JSX event listener (such as `onmessagesend` in our code) will call
our handler to handle the event emitted by the JSX component.

## Understanding Handlers

Handlers in Common Tools have a specific signature:

```{code-block} typescript
handler<EventType, ArgsType>(handlerFunction)
```

The `handler` function takes:
- Two **type** parameters:
  - `EventType`: defines the event data structure
  - `ArgsType`: defines the arguments/context that you want to pass to the handler
- One **argument**: we pass in a function which receives:
  - `event` (matches EventType) as its first parameter
  - `args` (matches ArgsType) as its second parameter

:::{dropdown} Detailed explanation
:animate: fade-in

The `handler` function returns a factory that you call with your actual arguments to create the event handler. This factory pattern allows the handler to bind specific values from your recipe while still receiving events from the UI components.
:::

We'll start by writing our handler which takes the event emitted by the
`<common-send-message>` component. This component emits a CustomEvent with the structure `{detail: {message: string}}`,
where `message` contains the text the user entered.
The handler will also take in the
`characterName` cell. It will simply set the cell with the new name
from the event.

### Creating the Handler

```{code-block} typescript
:label: state_handler_updatename
:linenos: false
:emphasize-lines:
const updateName = handler<
  { detail: { message: string } },
  { characterName: Cell<string> }
>(
  (event, { characterName }) => {
    console.log("Updating character name to:", event.detail.message);
    characterName.set(event.detail.message);
  }
);
```
Note that `characterName` was passed in as a `Cell`. We created it via the
`cell()` function, which returns us a `Cell`. It's important to
mark reactive components as `Cell` so that we can call methods such
as `set()` on them.

Now we can attach this handler to our input component:

```{code-block} typescript
:label: state_handler_attach
:linenos: false
:emphasize-lines:
<common-send-message
  name="Update"
  placeholder="Update Name"
  onmessagesend={updateName({ characterName })}
/>
```

If you deploy this code, you should see something like:

```{literalinclude} ./code/state_02.tsx

Et voilÃ  ! We've fully implemented modifying state through user input.

:::{admonition} Important!
Notice that if you reload the page, or even load the same URL on a different
browser, you'll see the saved data for your character's name.
This is because cells are persistent by default.
:::

:::{dropdown} Detailed explanation
:animate: fade-in

Each cell is created with a `cause` that uniquely identifies it.
We carefully construct the `cause` so that it remains the same
each time a recipe is run, but also unique from other cells created.
This leads to automatic persistence when using the Common Tools
runtime.
:::

## Adding Buttons

We'll create a button to roll "dice" for the character's Dexterity
value. This will update the existing value.

First let's create the handler for the click event. We
don't need details on the event itself, so we mark it as `unknown`.

```{code-block} typescript
:label: state_rollDex_handler
:linenos: false
:emphasize-lines:
const rollD6 = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;

const rollDex = handler<
  unknown,
  Cell<number>
>(
  (_, dex) => {
    // Roll 3d6 for new DEX value
    const roll = rollD6() + rollD6() + rollD6();
    dex.set(roll);
  }
);
```

This handler simulates rolling three six-sided dice (3d6) and sets the DEX value to the result.

Next, we'll add a button beside DEX in the UI and attach our handler:

```{code-block} typescript
:label: state_button_with_handler
:linenos: false
:emphasize-lines:
<li>
  DEX: {dex}
  {" "}
  <ct-button onClick={rollDex(dex)}>
    Roll
  </ct-button>
</li>
```
Note the `{" "}` between the DEX value and button - this adds just a little padding before the button.

When we click on the button, the elements that depend on the value of that cell are also updated. This means the DEX, DEX Modifier, and AC values are all updated.
 
You should see something like the following once you click on the Roll button:

```{literalinclude} ./code/state_03.tsx
:language: typescript
```

So far, we've been using `Cell` to store primitive data types. 
In the next section, we'll move on to objects and arrays.
