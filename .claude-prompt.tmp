I need help fixing GitHub issue #790: "Clicking suggestions seems to sometimes re-generate the exact same prompt, not the newly selected one?"

## Description
Discovered by @jsantell, need to investigate further. Seems like suggestions weren't doing much... we should fix them, but worth asking if we remove them for now?

marking as P3 for now, maybe we'll see this more often.

In `CharmDetailView` we present these suggestions and trigger generation on click, let's examine the code path to understand if it's failing to kick off, losing the task or something else strange is happening.

## Issue Analysis: Suggestions not applying correctly (#790)

After investigating the bug where "clicking suggestions seems to sometimes re-generate the exact same prompt, not the newly selected one", I've identified the root cause.

### Problem

In `CharmDetailView.tsx`, the `handleSuggestion` function (lines 660-673) has a race condition:

```typescript
const handleSuggestion = (suggestion: CharmSuggestion) => {
  setInput(suggestion.prompt);
  
  // Set the operation type based on suggestion type if possible
  if (suggestion.type.toLowerCase().includes("extend")) {
    setOperationType("extend");
  } else {
    setOperationType("iterate");
  }
  
  setShowVariants(true);
  // Use a micro-delay to ensure state updates before operation
  setTimeout(() => handlePerformOperation(), 0);
};
```

The code attempts to set multiple React state values (`setInput`, `setOperationType`, `setShowVariants`) and then immediately triggers `handlePerformOperation()` with a timeout. However, React state updates are asynchronous and batched, so the state values likely haven't been updated when `handlePerformOperation()` is called.

Looking at the `handlePerformOperation` implementation (lines 382-449), it specifically relies on these state values:
```typescript
const handlePerformOperation = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!input || !charm || !paramCharmId || !replicaName) return;
  // ... uses input, operationType, and other state values
}, [input, charm, paramCharmId, replicaName, showVariants, selectedModel, performOperation, charmManager, navigate, operationType]);
```

### Root Cause

The timeout of `setTimeout(() => handlePerformOperation(), 0)` is not sufficient to guarantee the state updates from `setInput`, `setOperationType`, and `setShowVariants` have been applied. This explains why clicking suggestions sometimes uses the previous prompt rather than the newly selected one.

### Proposed Solution

The React 18 approach to solving this would be to use `flushSync` or update the callback pattern:

```typescript
const handleSuggestion = (suggestion: CharmSuggestion) => {
  // Option 1: Use the callback pattern with the final state update
  setInput(suggestion.prompt);
  
  if (suggestion.type.toLowerCase().includes("extend")) {
    setOperationType("extend");
  } else {
    setOperationType("iterate");
  }
  
  // The final state update can receive a callback
  setShowVariants(true, () => {
    handlePerformOperation();
  });
};
```

Alternatively, since we have a `useBehavior` state machine hook in `View.tsx`, this would be an ideal candidate for refactoring to use the state machine pattern to properly sequence these operations.

Let me know if you'd like me to implement a fix for this issue!
