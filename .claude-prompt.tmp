## Description
in `charm/src/iterate.ts` we have `return compileAndRunRecipe(charmManager, newRecipeSrc, goal, input);`

We construct `newSpec` but throw it away, I think we should pass it where `goal` is so it's persisted.

We need to follow where that value goes and be able to retrieve it to display in `CharmDetailView` similarly to the code and arguments. Seems simple in theory.
