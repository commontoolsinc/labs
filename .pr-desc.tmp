Fixes #813

Based on the changes, here's a comprehensive PR description:

## Summary
Fixed the "Trying to connect" message in CharmList to be properly centered and styled, enhancing the user experience during connection establishment.

## What was fixed
- The "Trying to connect, please wait" message in CharmList.tsx was previously displayed as plain text without proper formatting or alignment
- The message appeared unstyled and inconsistent with other UI states in the application
- This created a jarring user experience when waiting for a connection

## How it was fixed
- Implemented a properly centered and styled message container
- Added the ShapeLogo component at the top of the message for visual consistency
- Structured the message with a clear heading and descriptive text
- Applied consistent styling and layout that matches the "No charms here" empty state
- Used flex layout with vertical centering to properly position the message

## Technical details
- Added proper semantic HTML structure with heading and paragraph elements
- Applied Tailwind CSS classes for consistent styling:
  - Used flex layout with center alignment
  - Set appropriate vertical height (70vh)
  - Added proper spacing and padding
  - Applied text styling consistent with the application's design system

## Testing considerations
- Verify the message appears correctly when connection is being established
- Ensure the layout is responsive across different screen sizes
- Confirm that the message transitions smoothly to the charms list once connected
- Check that the styling is consistent with other empty/loading states in the application
