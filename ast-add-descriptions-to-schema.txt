Task: AST - Add descriptions to JSON Schema from JSDoc

Objective
- Populate JSON Schema `description` fields from TypeScript JSDoc comments on types and properties during schema generation (toSchema<T>(), handler, recipe).
- Preserve explicit descriptions passed via options (they take precedence at the root).
- Add careful handling for composition (intersections, extends, aliases), nested shapes, arrays, and edge cases.

Comprehensive cases/considerations
1) Root type descriptions
   - interface Foo { ... }
   - type Foo = { ... }
   - Explicit options precedence: toSchema<Foo>({ description }) overrides root JSDoc
   - Re-export/alias: type Foo = Bar; JSDoc may be on Bar
2) Property descriptions
   - Primitive properties with JSDoc
   - Optional properties and union with undefined
   - Wrappers: Cell<T>, Stream<T>, Default<T,V>
   - Multi-line JSDoc; preserve newlines
3) Nested shapes
   - Nested object properties
   - Arrays of objects (element object’s properties with JSDoc)
   - Deeper nesting (array of objects containing arrays of objects)
4) Type composition
   - Intersections of object types with overlapping property names
     - Same descriptions → keep one
     - Conflicting descriptions → choose first non-empty, log warning, add $comment
   - interface A extends B (inherit docs on properties/root where applicable)
   - Aliases/re-exports: type X = Y; docs may be on Y
5) Union types (property-level)
   - Union of literals with JSDoc on the property: description applies to the property schema
   - Union of object branches: do not attempt per-branch description merge
6) Index signatures and mapped types
   - String/number index signatures with JSDoc → attach description to additionalProperties if feasible; otherwise $comment
   - Record<string, T> equivalent handling
7) Conflicting/ambiguous documentation
   - Multiple declarations/augmentations with different JSDoc
   - Prefer first non-empty; add $comment and warn
8) Formatting/markdown
   - Preserve markdown formatting inside JSDoc; no stripping/escaping
9) Recursive types
   - Ensure property descriptions appear consistently even when using $ref
10) Non-object properties
   - JSDoc on array property applies to array itself (not items)

V1 coverage decisions
- Include in V1 tests and implementation:
  - Root doc (interface and type), with precedence of explicit options
  - Property docs (primitive, optional) and coexistence with Cell/Stream/Default
  - Nested object and array-of-objects (one level deep)
  - Intersections with overlapping property names
    - Same doc → keep one
    - Different docs → pick first non-empty, add $comment and logger warning
  - Extends-based inheritance for properties’ docs
  - Index signature (string) with doc → attach to additionalProperties; if ambiguous, add $comment
  - Record<string, T> mapping treated like index signature
  - Preserve markdown and multiline text as-is
- Defer to V2 (document, not implement):
  - Deeply nested arrays-of-objects-of-objects
  - Union of object branches with per-branch doc propagation
  - Cross-file complex augmentations; ensure current warning path is sufficient

Initial failing tests already added
- Consolidated into a single pair: descriptions-all.input.ts / descriptions-all.expected.ts covering:
  - Root and precedence
  - Properties (primitive/optional/wrappers)
  - Nested array-of-objects
  - Intersections (same vs conflicting docs → $comment + warn)
  - Extends
  - Index signature and Record
  - Tag trimming at root

Additional failing tests to add per V1 decisions
- (Folded into descriptions-all.* as separate sections within the single file)

Implementation plan (detailed)
1) JSDoc extraction helpers (schema-generator.ts)
   - create function extractDocFromSymbol(symbol, checker): string | undefined
     - Use symbol.getDocumentationComment(checker) → ts.displayPartsToString()
     - If empty, check first declaration’s JSDoc (when available) via declaration.symbol
     - Normalize whitespace; trim; strip trailing/leading blank lines
     - Remove lines that start with @ (tags), but preserve all other content; keep blank lines
   - create function extractDocFromDeclarations(decls, checker): { text?: string; all: string[] }
     - Collect unique non-empty doc strings from all declarations
     - Return first non-empty as text and the list for conflict detection

2) Root description (typeToJsonSchema)
   - After computing rootSchema, attempt to obtain root type symbol (type.aliasSymbol || type.symbol || type.getSymbol?.()).
   - Extract doc text; if present AND rootSchema has no description (it won’t), attach description.
   - Precedence: schema.ts later merges options via { ...schema, ...optionsObj }, so an explicit description in options will override root description automatically (desired).

3) Property descriptions (buildObjectSchema)
   - For each property symbol:
     - Extract doc across declarations: const { text, all } = extractDocFromDeclarations(prop.declarations ?? [], checker) falling back to extractDocFromSymbol(prop, checker).
     - If text present: set properties[propName].description = text.
     - If all contains >1 distinct non-empty strings: add properties[propName].$comment = "Consolidated property docs from intersection constituents" and logger.warn with short summary.

4) Index signatures and mapped types (buildObjectSchema)
   - Before/after building named properties, check:
     - const stringIndex = checker.getIndexTypeOfType(type, IndexKind.String);
     - const numberIndex = checker.getIndexTypeOfType(type, IndexKind.Number);
   - If present, compute additionalProperties schema via typeToJsonSchemaHelper on the index type.
   - For index signature JSDoc:
     - Try to read from the type node when available (for interfaces) by inspecting members for index signatures and their JSDoc; otherwise fallback to a symbol-level doc.
     - If a doc string is found, attach it to additionalProperties.description (avoid nonstandard $comment to satisfy JSONSchema type and linter).

5) Intersections (already merged in prior fix)
   - Our intersection merge path remains: buildObjectSchema runs on the merged type.
   - For properties present in multiple constituents, the property symbol typically has multiple declarations; conflict handling from step 3 appends a parenthetical note to the description (e.g., "(Consolidated from intersection constituents)") and logs a warning.

6) Tag trimming and multi-line preservation
   - While extracting text, filter out lines starting with '@'. Do not alter remaining text; preserve blank lines and markdown.

7) Logging
   - Use existing schema-transformer logger. Warn on:
     - Consolidated conflicting property docs (intersection)
     - Index signature doc found and attached to $comment
     - Unexpected checker errors during JSDoc extraction (non-fatal)

8) Testing cadence
   - We already have a single failing consolidated fixture; implement features incrementally:
     a) Root + property descriptions
     b) Nested array-of-objects
     c) Extends
     d) Intersections conflict note
     e) Index signature / Record
     f) Tag trimming on root
   - Run full suite after each step; adjust only the descriptions-all pair.

9) Safety and non-regression
   - Only attach description/$comment when we have non-empty doc text.
   - Do not modify schemas for types without JSDoc; existing tests without comments remain unchanged.
   - For index signatures: only add additionalProperties when the type actually has an index signature (using checker API), matching TS semantics.

Assumption corrections and notes
- Ignore declaration-file docs: We now ignore JSDoc sourced from declaration files (e.g., lib.d.ts for built-ins like Map/Date) to avoid polluting schemas. Only user/project declarations contribute docs.
- Intersection alias awareness (deferred here): Intersections expressed via named type aliases (e.g., `type AB = A & B`) require unwrapping the alias to ensure the intersection merge path runs. This work is part of CT-762 and not included in this branch; intersection-specific assertions were removed from the consolidated fixture accordingly.

Progress to date (V1)
- Implemented JSDoc extraction and description attachment for:
  - Root types (with explicit options precedence)
  - Properties (including multiline preservation and tag trimming)
  - Nested object and array-of-objects (one level)
  - Intersections of object types with overlapping properties:
    - Same doc preserved
    - Conflicting docs: choose first non-empty, append "(Consolidated from intersection constituents)", and log a warning
  - Extends-based inheritance: derived schemas include docs from base and derived members
  - Index signatures and Record-like types: attach doc to additionalProperties.description
  - Ignored JSDoc from declaration files (lib.d.ts) as planned

- Tests
  - Consolidated fixture `descriptions-all.*` now green and includes sections for: nested/root, precedence, intersections (same/conflicting), extends, index/record, and tags.
  - Added focused fixtures to iterate and lock behavior:
    - `descriptions-nested-only.*`
    - `descriptions-precedence-only.*`
    - `descriptions-intersection-only.*`
    - `descriptions-extends-only.*`
    - `descriptions-index-record-only.*`
    - `descriptions-tags-only.*`

Review against plan: gaps and next steps
- V1 gaps addressed:
  - Wrappers coexistence verified (Cell ⇒ `asCell`, Stream ⇒ `asStream`, Default ⇒ `default`; property docs attached correctly).
  - Optional and `| undefined` unions verified (required set correct; docs retained).
  - Root alias docs verified (alias root `type X = Y` pulls doc from aliased type).
  - Recursive types with `$ref` verified (docs appear inside definition schema; top-level uses `$ref`).
  - Array property docs verified on array node (not items).

- Implementation notes:
  - We removed use of non-standard `$comment` in emitted schemas in favor of descriptions and logger warnings, matching the JSONSchema type.
  - Intersection alias awareness is exercised by `type AB = A & B` in tests and works end-to-end after upstream intersection fixes were merged.
  - Logging is present for consolidated intersection docs; we do not emit extra schema fields for warnings.

Proposed follow-ups (post-V1 hardening)
- All V1 items are now covered by tests. Keep the focused fixtures for clarity while the consolidated stays green.
- Consider a minimal doc conflict mode toggle in the future (e.g., strict/warn) if consumers want to customize consolidation behavior.
