/**
 * What a run on the default branch found that the pull request behind it
 * could not have found for itself.
 *
 * Selection means some regressions land and the run on the default
 * branch catches them. That trade is only acceptable if the change that
 * caused one finds out without anybody going looking, so this builds the
 * comment that tells it. Everything here is a pure function over three
 * runs' records — this one, the one before it on the default branch, and
 * the pull request's own — the manifest that pull request's run
 * resolved, and the coverage figures the two default-branch runs
 * measured. The gathering and the posting are in
 * `tasks/post-main-report.ts`.
 *
 * Five properties keep this on the right side of the wall's rule that
 * reporting is about the system and never about individuals, and each is
 * a constraint on what is written here rather than an observation about
 * it. The comment's subject is a commit and a test, and no author is
 * named. Nothing is counted per author, per team, or per anything, and
 * no history is kept anywhere. A test the selector declined to run is
 * described as coverage this design traded away, because the author did
 * not miss it. A test the store knows disagrees with itself is labelled
 * as one. And every note says what to do, in a comment that is edited in
 * place rather than repeated.
