/**
 * What a lane costs beyond the tests it runs, fitted from what lanes
 * have spent.
 *
 * A test's own cost is what the runner measured for it. A lane pays
 * more: it opens the capabilities its batches need, it starts a runner
 * per batch, and it loads a module per file. None of that is in any
 * test's duration, and all of it is in the five minutes a lane has.
 *
 * The packer already charges each of those — `setupCost` the first time
 * a lane opens a capability, a suite's `overhead` the first time a lane
 * holds that suite, its `unitOverhead` the first time a lane opens one of
 * its units, and its `correction` against every identity's own cost. What
 * it charges them from is this.
 *
 * The inputs are the lane's own measurements of itself, which travel to
 * the store as ordinary records. A lane writes one per capability it
 * opened and three per batch: what the batch spent, what its tests took
 * between them, and how many units it opened. The second and third are
 * what make a fit possible at all — neither can be recovered from the
 * records the batch produced, because a reader cannot tell which of a
 * report's records came from which batch, and a unit whose tests all
 * recorded nothing leaves no trace of having been opened.
 *
 * What the batch's tests took, rather than what the packer expected them
 * to take. The two differ by however wrong the manifest's costs are, and
 * a unit nothing has measured is charged a stand-in that can be wrong by
 * a factor of ten. Fitting against the expectation would put that error
 * in the intercept, where it is charged once per lane for as long as the
 * measurement is kept, long after the costs behind it were measured, and
 * a suite whose intercept passes the bound a lane is killed at places no
 * discretionary identity at all. The error a suite's cost model should
 * carry is the machine's, which is what the tests' own time leaves.
 *
 * What that costs is worth being plain about, because it is charged to
 * every lane rather than to the occasional bad window. The packer reads
 * the fitted slope against a manifest cost, which is the largest of the
 * days' ninetieth percentiles and so is deliberately above what a test
 * usually takes. A slope fitted against what tests usually take, read
 * against a figure padded above that, over-charges by the padding. So a
 * lane is packed short of what it could hold, by whatever margin the
 * cost figures carry, and the headroom that keeps a lane inside its
 * bound is that padding rather than this intercept. Under-packing is the
 * direction every figure here errs in; it is the price of an intercept
 * that measures the machine rather than the manifest.
 *
 * Every figure here errs high. A cost model that under-estimates puts a
 * lane past the bound it is killed at, where one that over-estimates
 * leaves a lane finishing early.
 *
 * One reading cannot manage it at both ends. A suite's fixed cost and
 * what one of its units costs are measured from batches of much the same
 * size, which cannot tell the two apart, so whichever way the split falls
 * the model is under a batch of some size. `fitSuite` says which end it
 * chooses and what bounds the error there.

 * What one unit costs a batch: a rate read off each batch, rather than a

 *
 * A slope needs the suite's batches to have disagreed about how many units
 * they held, and whether they do is a property of the run rather than of
 * the suite. The packer puts an identity in the cheapest lane that can
 * still hold it and breaks a tie by which lane is emptier, so a suite
 * gathers in the lanes already holding it and is shared out among them;
 * where every lane fills to one budget the counts come out close. Across
 * a full run of twenty-two lanes the widest gap between two batches of
 * one suite is around twenty units against batches of eighty. A
 * least-squares slope over a gap that narrow comes out negative for five
 * of the eight suites with enough batches to fit one, and inside its own
 * standard error for two more; the eighth is the suite whose per-unit
 * cost has been measured directly, and the slope reads it at twice that
 * figure. Across five lanes packing a selection the same suite has held
 * five units in one batch and six hundred in another, which is a gap
 * worth fitting over. So a threshold on that gap settles what a suite is
 * charged from the shape of the run it was measured in, and where it is
 * not met the suite is charged nothing a unit, which is the direction a
 * lane is killed in.
 *
 * What a batch does say on its own is a rate: what it spent beyond its
 * own tests, over the units that spending opened. Whatever the batch paid
 * for itself is in that rate, which is what carries a reading above what
 * a unit costs rather than below it. The middle reading is the one taken.
 * The largest charges every unit a small batch's whole fixed cost. The
 * smallest lands under the figure the same suites have been measured at
 * directly, because a batch's wall time moves by several seconds for
 * reasons that have nothing to do with what the batch held, and because
 * a correction fitted from the tests alone takes some of what a unit
 * costs with it.
 *
 * A batch whose spending is under what its own tests are charged has
 * nothing left to attribute to its units, which is where a suite running
 * its files in parallel lands. That is not evidence a unit gives time
