/**
 * The coverage gate, as the job that joins the lanes runs it.
 *
 * A measured set is one suite's units over one workspace member's lines.
 * The lanes run every unit of every set the change reaches, with coverage
 * turned on, and each writes one report per set. This adds those reports
 * up per set, scores each set over its member's own lines, and compares
 * the count against what the same set measured at the newest `main`
 * commit the branch contains. A rise fails, unless the pull request's
 * description accepts it.
 *
 * Which sets are gated is worked out here from the topology and the diff,
 * by the same function the lanes run, rather than read out of what a lane
 * reported. Two answers to that question would let a lane talk this into
 * gating something it did not measure, or into skipping something it did.
