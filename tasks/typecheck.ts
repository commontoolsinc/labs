/**
 * The repository type check, run per package. Each owning scope's paths are
 * checked as their own `deno check` invocation, timed and recorded as that
 * scope's `typecheck`-kind test, the way cfcheck already shards pattern
 * type-checking; the invocations run concurrently and any failure fails
 * the whole task. tasks/check.sh owns the Deno version gate and delegates
 * here.
 *
 * This list is the only type check a path gets whose tests run under
 * `--no-check`: those runs lean on this task, via the Check job's "Type
 * check codebase" step, for type safety. A package whose test task checks
 * its own files instead — `packages/patterns` among them — is reached both
 * ways. Before adding `--no-check` to a test invocation, make sure every
 * file it loads is under a path listed here, because that flag is what
 * moves the file's type checking here. Removing a path removes the checking
 * this task gives it.
