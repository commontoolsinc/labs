//
// Fails when an import map declares a dependency that nothing imports.
//
// Each package's Deno config (deno.jsonc or deno.json), and the root's, map
// short aliases to concrete specifiers in an `imports` block. An alias that no
// source file imports is dead weight: it still resolves and downloads on
// install, it can pin a second copy of a package the rest of the tree already
// has, and it survives `deno outdated`, which only reports packages that are
// behind. An unused dependency at its newest release is invisible to that tool,
// so nothing catches it drifting in. This check does.
//
// An alias counts as used when some source file *in that import map's scope*
// imports it. Scope follows Deno's own resolution:
//
//   - The root deno.jsonc import map is inherited by every file in the
//     workspace, so a root alias is used when any source file imports it.
//   - A workspace member's import map governs only the files inside that
//     member, so a member alias is used only when a file under that member
//     imports it. An alias a member declares but only a *different* member
//     imports is dead in the declaring member: the importer resolves it some
//     other way (a root alias, or a workspace package name), not through this
//     declaration.
//
// "Imports it" means the alias appears as a module specifier after `from`,
// `import`, `import(`, `require(`, or a `@ts-types=` companion-type comment (or
// its older `@deno-types=` spelling) — either exactly, or as the head of a
// `<alias>/subpath`. A slash-terminated alias (for example `@/`) is a prefix
// mapping, so any specifier starting with it counts. Text inside comments or
// strings can produce a false "used", which only ever hides a dead entry; it
// never flags a live one, so the check does not misfire on a real dependency.
//
// A type-only companion package (`@types/*`) is never imported by name. It
// reaches its package through a `@ts-types=` comment on that package's import,
// which is why that form is one of the specifier shapes above. Without the
// comment the `@types/*` alias is genuinely unused, and this check says so.
//
// The source files searched are the ones git tracks. Reading the tracked set
// rather than walking the filesystem is what makes the scope exact: it leaves
// out generated output (dist, coverage, the Deno cache) and dependency trees
// with no directory-name skiplist to keep current, and it includes a source
// file that a .gitignore rule matches but git still tracks — the repository has
// such files, and a name-based walk filter would wrongly drop them and report
// their imports' aliases unused. Off a git working tree (a unit-test fixture)
// nothing is tracked, so the scan falls back to walking.
//
// Two import shapes are not recognised, because no source in this workspace
// uses them to reach an import-map alias: a `@jsxImportSource <alias>` pragma
// (the configured jsx source is a workspace package, not an alias) and a
// `/// <reference types="<alias>" />` directive. If either is ever pointed at
// an alias, the check reports that alias unused; wire the alias up through one
// of the recognised shapes, or allowlist it.
//
// The ALLOWLIST holds aliases that are declared without a local import on
// purpose; each entry records why.
//
// Usage: deno run --allow-read --allow-run=git ./tasks/check-unused-deps.ts
