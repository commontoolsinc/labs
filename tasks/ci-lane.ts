/**
 * The script every pull-request lane runs, and the script every lane of
 * the full run on `main` runs.
 *
 * Lanes call this with their own lane number and nothing else. There is
 * no job ahead of them deciding what each will do: packing is a pure
 * function of the working tree, the manifest, the diff, and the lane
 * number, so every lane computes the same plan over the same inputs and
 * takes its own share of it. That only holds while every lane resolves
 * the same manifest, which is why the moment they resolve it at is when
 * the commit under test was made rather than anything about the run.
 *
 * The full run differs in two values: it runs the whole corpus rather
 * than a budgeted part of it, and it has no diff. Everything else — what
 * the tree holds, what each test costs, how the work groups into lanes,
 * which identities inside a unit are skipped — is the same code, so the
 * two runs cannot come to different answers about the same tree.
 *
 * `main` cannot fix its number of lanes ahead of time the way a pull
 * request does, because the number depends on how much work there is and
 * the job matrix has to exist before anything starts. So one job asks
 * `--lane-count` and emits an integer, and that integer is the whole of
 * what passes from it to the lanes.
