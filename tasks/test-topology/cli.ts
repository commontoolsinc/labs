/**
 * The command-line integration suites.
 *
 * All three record under one surface, kind `integration` and scope `cli`,
 * and what tells them apart is the name a record carries. The dispatch
 * script's steps belong to `cli-core`, the FUSE script's to `cli-fuse`,
 * and the Deno-based tests to `cli-deno`, which is an ordinary `deno
 * test` file suite.
 *
 * The two shell suites share a shape rather than a script. Each is one
 * script with a `case "$SECTION" in` table, dispatched by an environment
 * variable, whose arms run work that records itself. What differs is how
 * far an arm sits from the records it causes — `integration.sh` names
 * each step where it begins it, and `fuse-exec.sh` names a phase whose
 * function announces the sentence the record carries — and which arms a
 * lane may be pointed at. So the table is read once, the attribution and
 * the command are written once, and each suite supplies the two answers
 * that are its own.
