/**
 * Whether each shipped binary still compiles.
 *
 * The binaries are built on every pull request today, so a compile that
 * breaks is caught before it lands. Under selection a pull request runs
 * its servers and its command line from source, and never compiles
 * anything — which would leave a broken compile to be found on `main`,
 * after the change that broke it has merged. These suites keep it a
 * pull-request signal by making the build a test like any other: it has
 * an identity, it accumulates a record of what it has caught, and the
 * packer can choose it.
 *
 * Nothing forces one to run. A binary the store has never seen is
 * unknown and therefore mandatory, so each is built once; after that it
 * sits at the value floor until it catches something. When a compile
 * does break, `main` catches it, and a `main` catch is weighted half
 * again for being exactly the escape this system exists to stop — one of
 * them lifts a build from the floor to several times it, which is enough
 * to be chosen against a corpus where almost nothing has ever failed.
 * That feedback loop is the mechanism. A hand-maintained map from
 * changed paths to binaries would be the kind of transcribed table this
 * design exists to delete, and it would go stale the first time an
 * import moved.
 *
 * What a compile catches that nothing else does is worth naming, because
 * every one of these builds passes `--no-check`. Type errors belong to
 * `deno task check`. What is left is everything else the compile does:
 * resolving the whole import graph from an entry point, bundling the
 * browser shell, and embedding each `--include`d asset from a path that
 * has to still exist.
