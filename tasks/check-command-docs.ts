/**
 * Fails when something a caller can type is described in no live document.
 *
 * `docs/README.md` already obliges a change that alters documented behavior to
 * update the document in the same change. That obligation cannot fire for a
 * word no document describes: nothing is wrong, because nothing claimed to
 * cover it. So a command ships, the prose does not, and the absence is visible
 * only to someone who already knows the command exists.
 *
 * Two surfaces are held to that. `cf`'s command tree is walkable and shuttle's
 * verbs are one table, the documents are greppable, and so for each the
 * question is machine-answerable: is this word described anywhere a reader
 * would find it? They are one check rather than two because the second half of
 * a gate is where a gate divides — the same two directions, the same live-
 * document rule and the same escape, said in the words of whichever surface is
 * at fault.
 *
 * What this cannot decide is whether a word SHOULD have prose. Plenty should
 * not — an internal entry point exists for the packaged binary to call, and a
 * forensics subcommand may be `--help`-discoverable by design. What it requires
 * is that every one has been decided about, which is what {@link NO_PROSE} and
 * {@link NO_VERB_PROSE} record. That turns the next command's documentation
 * from something remembered into something the gate asks for.
 *
 * Usage: deno task check-command-docs
 *        deno task check-command-docs --list   # everything undocumented
