#!/usr/bin/env -S deno run --allow-read
//
// Fails CI when a known-weakness TRIPWIRE has been resolved — or removed.
//
// A tripwire asserts that a weakness is STILL PRESENT, so that fixing the
// weakness breaks the build. The break is the point: it is the only structural
// reminder that some fixes carry an obligation elsewhere in the repo, months
// later, for someone who has no reason to know the obligation exists.
//
// This check deliberately DUPLICATES the assertion made by the tripwire's unit
// test, and lives in a different task family. A failing unit test can be
// deleted, skipped, or "fixed" by an agent doing mechanical assertion repair;
// silencing the obligation should require finding and neutering BOTH, in two
// places, in one diff that a reviewer can see. It also verifies the test file
// is still present and intact, so deleting it fails here instead of quietly
// succeeding.
//
// Usage: deno run --allow-read ./tasks/check-tripwires.ts
