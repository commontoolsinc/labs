/**
 * Tier 2's gate: replay every pinned vintage under TODAY's pattern source.
 *
 * Tier 1 (`deno task pattern-compat`) proves the contract a pattern declares is
 * still compatible with every contract it has declared before. That is a
 * statement about schemas. This proves the stronger thing schemas cannot say:
 * that a real document written by an older version is still materializable by
 * the version about to be merged.
 *
 * Precisely what a green run asserts, per fixture: today's source RESOLVES for
 * every recorded instantiation, the setup that carries the artifact each root
 * NAMES onto that root is not refused and completes, the root then reads as
 * something rather than nothing, AND every value the vintage held is still
 * readable afterwards.
 *
 * It asserts two things about the exemption list as well, and a clean replay
 * does not excuse either. Every path in `ACCEPTED_STATE_DROPS` must still
 * forgive something in a vintage inside its own `capturedThrough` window — an
 * entry that has stopped removing anything has outlived the removal it was
 * granted for, and the run exits 1 naming it. And an entry whose pattern no
 * fixture records is UNJUDGEABLE rather than stale: nothing replays it, so
 * nothing can say whether it is still needed, and that fails too rather than
 * sitting unexamined.
 *
 * That last clause is the one that makes this a state-continuity gate rather
 * than an applies-cleanly gate. An update can materialize perfectly and still
 * lose data: move where a field is stored — `.for("journal")` becomes
 * `.for("journalMoved")` — and the declared contract does not change by a byte
 * while every document written under the old name goes unreachable. Nothing
 * throws. Measured on the real `home.tsx`, that now exits 1 naming the key and
 * showing what was there.
 *
 * The comparison reads the vintage under the root's OWN stored schema, so it
 * sees the data as the version that wrote it did, and compares only keys that
 * were present BEFORE: an update may legitimately ADD a field — that is what
 * `Default<>` is for — so a new key is not a finding, while an existing key
 * whose value changed is. That schema is relaxed at its `unknown` positions
 * first, on both sides: a schema-driven read resolves nothing there, so a key
 * an index signature covers would otherwise arrive as `undefined` however much
 * state it holds — indistinguishable from a key the document does not hold.
 *
 * It compares STATE, not renderings. `$UI` and its variants are recomputed by
 * the setup and the stored rendering never matches a fresh one, so comparing
 * them would red every pattern edit while saying nothing about data; every
 * other key is compared, `$NAME` included. Excluding those NAMES is not enough
 * on its own — a `map`-body hoist is a recorded instantiation whose whole
 * result is a vnode, under no `$UI` — so a rendering is recognized by shape
 * too, wherever it sits. What a root holds at a cell or stream position is
 * compared as the DOCUMENT it points at, so a field that moved to a different
 * doc is still a finding.
 *
 *   deno task pattern-vintage                                  # replay; fail on a stranded fixture
 *   deno task pattern-vintage --update topics/topics.test.tsx  # first pinned fixture
 *   deno task pattern-vintage --capture-changed                # capture a generation where due
 *   deno task pattern-vintage --pin topics/topics.test.tsx     # promote the newest generation
 *
 * `--update` always names a TEST path, never a pattern path — a fixture is
 * produced by RUNNING a test, and covers whatever that test instantiates, which
 * is routinely several patterns none of which share its name. `system/x.tsx`
 * names no test and captures nothing.
 *
 * There is no bare `--update`, and no list of what CI replays. Every fixture
 * under the vintages tree is replayed by the plain command, so committing a
 * captured fixture is the whole of adding one. A default seed set would only
 * ever serve a MISSING fixture, and that is exactly when nothing on disk knows
 * which test covers the pattern.
 *
 * `--update` can only ADD. It never rewrites or deletes an existing fixture,
 * for the reason Tier 1's baselines are append-only: a command that could
 * replace a vintage could replace the very vintage that would have caught a
 * break. Deleting one is a deliberate act that shows up in review as a deleted
 * file. Naming keys explicitly does not weaken that — a key that already has a
 * pinned vintage is skipped whichever way it was asked for.
 *
 * ## The two tiers
 *
 * `pinned/` is evidence: never pruned, and the only tier that credits
 * coverage. `auto/` is history: captured automatically wherever today's source
 * has moved past every generation on disk, and pruned by count.
 *
 * That split is what makes the gate get STRONGER over time rather than just
 * staying green. A single pinned vintage only ever proves today's source can
 * read one particular old world; a run of generations proves it can read every
 * world the pattern has passed through. Accumulating them is cheap in the only
 * place it is permanent — git deltas adjacent generations of a near-identical
 * store to ~9 KiB — and bounded where it is not, since each one also costs
 * 3.5 MiB of working-tree disk in every clone.
 *
 * NO writing command runs in CI, and there are three: `--update`,
 * `--capture-changed` and `--pin`. CI runs the plain gate, which only ever
 * READS the tree. A gate that wrote its own evidence would be grading its own
 * homework, so all three land in the working tree to be committed and reviewed
 * like any other change.
 *
 * `--capture-changed` refuses to capture onto a red tree, which is also what
 * removes the need for a rule about capturing mid-edit: a generation is a
 * record of a world that worked, and a release promotes from a branch that
 * already passed.
 *
 * That discipline is enforced HERE, in what the command will do, and otherwise
 * rests on review — deliberately, and unlike Tier 1, whose baselines have a
 * mechanical checker (`tasks/check-baselines-append-only.ts`). There is no
 * equivalent gate over `packages/piece/test/vintages/`, so a deleted fixture is
 * caught by a human reading the diff and nothing else. Recapturing one is
 * therefore a decision to make out loud, not a routine step.
 *
 * This file is the shell — roots, argument parsing, printing, exit code. The
 * work is in `pattern-vintage-run.ts`, which takes its roots as arguments so
 * the gate can be proved to FAIL against a deliberately broken pattern
 * (`pattern-vintage-run.test.ts`).
