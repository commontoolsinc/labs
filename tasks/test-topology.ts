/**
 * Every test surface the repository has, declared once.
 *
 * A suite says what setup it needs, how to list the things its runner can
 * be pointed at, how to recognize its own records, and what command runs a
 * chosen subset. Nothing else knows about a test surface: the full run's
 * job matrix is computed from here, the lane runner reads the working tree
 * through here, and the publisher scores what this claims. Adding a test,
 * a kind of test, or a configuration of existing tests is a change to a
 * module under `tasks/test-topology/` and never a change to the
 * continuous-integration configuration.
 *
 * `deno task check-test-topology` is what makes that a checked property
 * rather than a hope: one half walks the tree for things that look like
 * tests and fails on any that no suite claims, and the other reads a
 * `main` run's records and fails on any identity no suite recognizes.
