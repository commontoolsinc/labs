/**
 * These pin the walkthrough↔demo sync check to the four drift classes it
 * exists to catch, each of which shipped at least once: a composed command
 * the demo never runs (one was wrong from the day it was written and
 * survived four editing passes), an act reference gone stale under
 * renumbering (twice), a shape-table row pairing a verb with an act that
 * no longer shows it, and a write quoted with a value other than the one the
 * demo pipes — invisible for as long as the payload was dropped, and the
 * substance of every act a tour about writing narrates.
 *
 * The real files are checked too, so the gate's green on this repository is
 * itself a pinned fact — and so is the check's grip: each class is asserted
 * by injecting one violation into the real walkthrough and watching it
 * surface.
