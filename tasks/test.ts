 * Entry point for the root `deno task test`. The implementation lives in
 * workspace-tests.ts because `deno coverage` skips files whose names end in
 * test.ts, and the coverage-debt metric scores an unmeasured file as fully
 * uncovered.
 *
 * This entry point owns the run for test recording: with a personal key
 * present it stamps a spool, points its producers at it, ships it when the
 * run ends, and sweeps for orphans. Inside CI it joins the job's spool
 * instead, and with neither the whole path is inert. Recording never
 * changes the exit status.
