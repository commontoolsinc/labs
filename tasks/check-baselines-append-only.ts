/**
 * The pattern-update gate's safety argument is that `--update` can only ADD a
 * baseline — a command that could remove one could remove the very baseline
 * that would have caught a break. That argument is worth nothing unless the
 * store is actually append-only, and `rm` is not `--update`. Two commands
 * launder an incompatible change:
 *
 *     rm packages/patterns/baselines/system/home.tsx/2026...-<hash>.json
 *     deno task pattern-compat --update      # now green
 *
 * In a diff that already carries tens of thousands of lines of recorded JSON,
 * one deleted file is not something review reliably catches. So CI checks it.
 *
 * The one legitimate deletion is retirement: a pattern that no longer exists
 * has no pieces to roll forward, so its baselines may go WITH it. That is
 * accepted only when the pattern file is deleted in the same change — which is
 * also exactly what the gate's own `retired` message instructs.
 *
 * Usage: check-baselines-append-only.ts [base-ref]   (default: origin/main)
