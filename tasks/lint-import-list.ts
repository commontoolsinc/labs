/**
 * A lint rule that holds one module's entry in a file's import list to one
 * statement of each kind.
 *
 * A module is imported in one statement, marking any type-only names inline,
 * or in two when one of them is an `import type` and the other is a value
 * import. What this rule reports is a second statement of the same kind for
 * one module: two value imports of it, or two `import type`s of it. Written
 * that way, one dependency reads as two, and the second is easy to miss when
 * the first is being edited or removed.
 *
 * A bare `import "x";` is a value statement, so it counts toward that module's
 * total, and what it counts against decides what happens to it. Beside a value
 * import that binds something, it adds nothing, since that import evaluates
 * the module, side effects included: the rule reports the bare statement.
 * Beside nothing but an `import type`, it is the only statement that evaluates
 * the module at all, and the rule leaves the pair alone as two statements of
 * different kinds.
 *
 * Between those sits a statement that names nothing but types, `import { type
 * Thing } from "x";`. It is a value statement to the grammar, and TypeScript
 * erases it as it erases an `import type`, so it evaluates nothing either.
 * Beside a bare import of the same module, the rule reports that statement
 * rather than the bare one, because writing it `import type` is what makes the
 * pair legal and leaves the module evaluated.
 *
 * Whichever statement survives a merge goes where the earliest of the
 * statements it replaces sat. That is what keeps the module's evaluation at
 * the point in the list it was already reached from, which matters when the
 * module installs something that an import below it reads as that one loads.
 *
 * One pair has no merge at all: a namespace import takes no other name beside
 * it, so `import * as name from "x"` and a named import of `x` of the same
 * kind cannot become one statement. Usually the fix is to reach through the
 * namespace for what the named statement took. Where that reads worse — a
 * namespace imported only so its `typeof` names the whole module, against a
 * list of names the file uses throughout — the pair stays, and takes a
 * `deno-lint-ignore` saying which case it is.
 *
 * The rule reads a specifier as written, so two spellings of one module —
 * `@/thing.ts` and `../thing.ts` — are two modules to it. Which spelling to
 * use is a separate rule of the same section, and one for review.
 *
 * See the `Imports` section of docs/development/DEVELOPMENT.md.
