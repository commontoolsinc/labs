/**
 * Static guards over the two accepted-break registries
 * (`pattern-compat-accepted-breaks.ts`, `pattern-vintage-accepted-drops.ts`).
 *
 * The registries' own audits are per-run and per-finding: an entry that stops
 * forgiving anything fails the run that would have used it. These guards are
 * about what an entry IS, before any finding exists:
 *
 * - **No entry may name a required pattern.** The home and default-app roots
 *   are the patterns that update aggressively and unconditionally — a break
 *   accepted there is a decision to strand every space's root the moment it
 *   merges, which is never the intent of a per-pattern exemption. The
 *   required set comes in from the caller, derived from the runtime's own
 *   constants (the same seam `pattern-vintage` already uses), so this guard
 *   cannot drift from what actually auto-updates.
 * - **Every entry names its decision record, and the record exists.** The
 *   registry line is the declaration; the record under `docs/history/` is the
 *   deliberation — what broke, why it was accepted, and what happens to the
 *   pieces holding the old shape. A record is a Markdown document of that
 *   tree's own: the path may not step back out of it, and the tree's live
 *   scaffolding (`README.md`, `INDEX.md`) does not qualify.
 *   `check-docs-history-index` forces every other document under the tree to
 *   be indexed, so this guard's shape-plus-existence check is membership.
 *
 * Pure and parameterized (entries, required set, existence probe) so the
 * rules are provable against synthetic registries in
 * `pattern-break-registry-guards.test.ts`, with the shipped registries
 * checked against the real tree in the same suite.
