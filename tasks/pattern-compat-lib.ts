/**
 * Tier 1 of the pattern-update regime: prove that a pattern's current
 * argument/result contract can still be applied to every version of itself
 * that is, or was, deployed.
 *
 * Why this exists as a CI gate rather than a runtime check: `cf piece setsrc`
 * refuses an incompatible replacement (`PieceController.setPattern` calls
 * `assertPatternSchemasBackwardCompatible`), but the *automatic* updater does
 * not — `PatternUpdater` compiles, verifies the entry identity, and applies via
 * `runtime.setup`/`patternIdentity` with no structural comparison at all
 * (docs/specs/pattern-imports/pattern-updates.md, "The specialized system-source
 * updater does not perform the complete pre-apply structural comparison").
 * An incompatible schema that merges is therefore applied silently to every
 * running piece. CI is the only gate, so this reuses the exact function
 * `setsrc` enforces rather than reimplementing the rule.
 *
 * This module is the pure core: no compiling, no filesystem, no git. The task
 * shell (`pattern-compat.ts`) supplies the compiled contracts and the baseline
 * files it read off disk.
