/**
 * Holds every pattern source in a "do not copy" tier to carrying a marker that
 * says so, and every marker to naming the tier the tables give that file.
 *
 * `packages/patterns` is example code whose examples carry unequal authority.
 * A legacy or fixture pattern is indistinguishable from an exemplar in a
 * directory listing, and copying one is the failure this guards: the wrong
 * idiom propagates into new patterns, and from there into the next thing that
 * copies those. `packages/patterns/index.md` explains the tiers; the marker is
 * what puts the answer in front of a reader who never opened the index.
 *
 * The check runs in both directions. A file the tables place in a marked tier
 * and that carries no marker fails, so a pattern added to `gideon-tests/`
 * cannot arrive unmarked. A marker on a file the tables do not place fails
 * too, so a marker cannot outlive the reason for it. A table entry matching no
 * file fails last, which is what catches a directory renamed out from under
 * the tables.
 *
 *   deno task check-pattern-tiers    # check (what CI runs; cannot write)
 *   deno task fix-pattern-tiers      # add or correct the markers
 *
 * Applying a marker can change a pattern's update contract, so run
 * `deno task pattern-compat` afterwards. A pattern carrying information-flow
 * labels derives part of its schema from its own source, and the two lines a
 * marker adds are enough to move that: the gate then reports the new contract
 * as unrecorded, and the answer is to record it with
 * `deno task pattern-compat --update`. The marker changes no behavior, and a
 * marker on an imported module moves the importing pattern's contract too.
