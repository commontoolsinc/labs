/**
 * Which pattern sources must carry a tier marker, and what that marker says.
 *
 * `packages/patterns/index.md` sorts this package into tiers by how much
 * authority an example carries. Two of those tiers mean "do not copy": legacy
 * (superseded) and fixture (scaffolding that pins a bug). An index states that
 * where a reader has to go looking for it, and a reader who opened the file
 * from a directory listing or a grep hit never does. So each file in those two
 * tiers opens with a marker saying which one it is.
 *
 * The tables below are what `check-pattern-tiers.ts` holds the markers to. A
 * whole directory takes a tier through `TIER_DIRECTORIES`; a loose file takes
 * one through `TIER_FILES`. Membership and marker are checked in both
 * directions, so a file listed here without a marker fails, and a marker on a
 * file not listed here fails too.
 *
 * The other three tiers — primitive, exemplar, demo — carry no marker. Their
 * instruction is to copy, or to copy the capability call and not the style,
 * which is what a reader already assumes, so a marker on the several hundred
 * remaining pattern sources would buy nothing. `check-pattern-tiers` reports
 * both counts on a passing run.
