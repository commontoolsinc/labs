/**
 * State a pattern stopped holding on purpose, and therefore no longer owes a
 * vintage.
 *
 * Tier 2 asks whether a real document written by an older version is still
 * readable by the version about to merge, and its default answer to "no" is
 * that the update lost data. That answer is right almost every time: a moved
 * `.for()` key strands state while the declared contract does not change by a
 * byte, which is exactly the failure the tier exists for.
 *
 * It is not right when the state was removed on purpose. The feature behind it
 * is gone, what it held is an accepted casualty, and no change to the pattern
 * makes the vintage readable again — the comparison is measuring the decision
 * itself. That is a Tier 1 conversation first: a removal reaches here only
 * after `tasks/pattern-compat-accepted-breaks.ts` has already accepted it as a
 * contract break, and the two lists are meant to be read together.
 *
 * An entry names PATHS, not fixtures and not bare field names, and that bound
 * is what keeps it from becoming an off switch. `crossrefs` forgives the root
 * key of that name and nothing else; `topics[].crossrefs` forgives it on each
 * element of the `topics` list. A same-named field anywhere else — on an
 * unrelated nested object, under a different root — is compared exactly as
 * before, so a removal that also strands a body, a thread, or a timestamp
 * still fails.
 *
 * Nothing off the path to an accepted drop is rebuilt, either: the comparison
 * has to see the state it was handed, and a subtree that lost nothing is
 * returned as itself rather than as a copy of itself.
 *
 * An entry is bounded in TIME as well, by `capturedThrough`. A removal happened
 * once, and only the vintages captured before it hold state that cannot roll
 * forward — so a vintage captured later is compared with no exemption at all.
 * That is what keeps a REPLACED path honest: `crossrefs` is still published,
 * carrying pivot rows now, and an entry that forgave it forever would hide a
 * later change that stranded those.
 *
 * The list can only shrink. A path that removes nothing from any vintage in its
 * own window fails the run, so an exemption cannot outlive the removal it was
 * granted for.
