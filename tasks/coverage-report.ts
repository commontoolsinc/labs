 * Two quantities come out of the same reports the lanes wrote. The
 * repository-wide uncovered-line count is the merge of every report,
 * scored over every tracked source file, and it is a trend: the dashboard
 * shows it and nothing gates on it. Each measured set's count is one
 * suite's units over one workspace member's lines, and it is the baseline
 * the coverage gate compares a pull request against.
 *
 * Nothing here fails a run. A rise in the repository-wide figure reaches
 * the change that caused it through the run report on its pull request,
 * and a rise in a measured set reaches it through the gate before it
 * lands.
