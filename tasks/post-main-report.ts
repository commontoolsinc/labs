/**
 * Tells a pull request what a later run on the default branch found.
 *
 * Selection means some regressions land and the run on the default
 * branch is what catches them. This follows every such run, works out
 * what it found that the pull request behind its commit could not have
 * found for itself, and comments once on that pull request. It runs in
 * the base-repository context with a write token, which is what lets it
 * comment at all.
 *
 * The repository squash-merges with the pull request number in the
 * subject, so the pull request behind a commit is unambiguous. A commit
 * pushed directly, with no pull request behind it, is the ordinary case
 * for finding none: the commit is logged and nothing is posted.
 *
 * Three runs' records are what the notes rest on, and they come from two
 * places for one reason each. The two runs on the default branch are
 * read from their own `test-records-*` artifacts: those are readable the
 * moment a run ends, where the store holds a run's records only once the
 * relay has shipped them, and two merges landing close together are
 * exactly when the earlier relay is still running and exactly the case
 * this exists for.
 *
 * The pull request's own run is read from the store instead, because the
 * relay is where the trust decision about it was made. Records from a
 * fork run are authored by the fork, and the relay ships them only for a
 * member; reading that run's artifacts would take fork-authored claims
 * about which tests passed and put them in a comment. What the store
 * holds is what this repository was willing to believe.
 *
 * Environment:
 *   GITHUB_TOKEN         - Required.
 *   GITHUB_EVENT_PATH    - The workflow_run payload naming the run.
 *   GITHUB_REPOSITORY    - Optional, defaults to "commontoolsinc/labs".
 *   MAIN_REPORT_RUN_ID   - Optional, the run to report on in place of the
 *                          payload's, for running this by hand.
 *
 * `--dry-run` prints what it would say and posts nothing:
 *
 *   GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) MAIN_REPORT_RUN_ID=<id> \
 *     deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write \
 *     --allow-run=git,unzip tasks/post-main-report.ts --dry-run
