 * every fixture for a key reports something changed, the tree no longer holds
 * a generation of today, and the next one is due.
 *
 * Two shapes deliberately do NOT count as current, for opposite reasons:

 *   - a fixture with no targets proved nothing, so it cannot be evidence that
 *     the world has not moved;
 *   - a fixture that FAILED is not a statement about currency at all — it is

 *     decide whether to capture.
 *
 * The second is a SECOND LOCK, not the operative rule.
 * `captureChangedGenerations` returns `refused-red` on any failure before this
 * is ever called, so no production path reaches it today. It stays because
 * this function is exported and answers a question — "is a generation due" —
 * that a caller could reasonably ask without refusing on red first, and
 * because the honest answer to that question from a broken fixture is "this
 * fixture cannot tell you".
 *
 * A served-route-only fixture reports `changed === 0` and so reads as current,
 * which is right: its identity is not reproducible from the repo, so no
 * capture could ever move it off zero and a staleness rule that counted it
 * would capture a new generation on every single run, forever.
 *
 * An ADOPTED old-toolchain fixture (`tasks/vintage-adopt.ts`) is the same
 * hazard from the opposite side: it IS identity-compared, so it reports
 * `changed > 0` for as long as its recorded identity differs from today's —
 * which for a committed old-toolchain capture is every run in practice. It
 * reads as stale here by design — the rule holds because the key's NATIVE
 * fixtures are what satisfy currency. A test key whose only fixtures were
 * adopted would trigger a capture on every `--capture-changed` run; today

 * Capture a vintage by running a TEST against a file-backed store, then

 *
 * Keyed by the TEST, not by a pattern. The earlier shape went the other way —
 * take a pattern key and derive `<pattern>.test.tsx` — which only works where a
 * test is named after the single pattern it drives. Measured, that holds for 91
 * of 120 tests in `packages/patterns` and not for the interesting ones:
 * `topics/main.tsx` is tested by `topics/topics.test.tsx`, and
 * `lunch-poll/multi-user.test.tsx` drives several patterns and is named after
 * none of them.
 *
 * Running the test and recording what it instantiates needs no naming
 * convention at all, and covers every pattern the test touches rather than the
 * one whose name matched.
 *
 * The tests are what put DATA in the fixture. A vintage captured straight off
 * setup holds a freshly materialized root and nothing else, so no change can
 * strand anything in it. Pattern tests are themselves patterns —
 * `home.test.tsx` instantiates `Home({})` and drives it with
 * `action()`/`assert()` — so what they leave behind is real pattern state
 * written through real handlers.
 *
 * Each capture gets a FRESH store. Vintages are independent snapshots of one
 * version's world, never one database migrated forward: a carried-forward
 * lineage would already be shaped by every migration since, and would no longer
 * be state written by a version that knew nothing about today's.
