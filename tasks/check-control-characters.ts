/**
 * Fails when a tracked source file contains a control codepoint below 0x20
 * other than newline.
 *
 * A literal control character in source is almost always meant as a value —
 * `"\x00"` written as the byte rather than the escape — and it reads
 * identically to the escape at runtime while behaving differently everywhere
 * a person or a tool looks at the FILE.
 *
 * A single NUL is the sharp case, because it flips the binary heuristic for
 * the whole file: `file` reports `data` rather than source, `grep` skips the
 * file silently rather than erroring, and the GitHub diff view renders the
 * line wrong. A reader who greps for a symbol in such a file is told there
 * are no matches, which is worse than being told nothing — the answer looks
 * like an answer. The escape sequence produces the same string with none of
 * that, so nothing is given up by requiring it.
 *
 * Newline is the one exception, since it is what separates the lines. A
 * carriage return is not: a CRLF file is a line-ending accident here, and a
 * lone CR moves the cursor rather than the line. Tab is not either — the
 * formatter indents with spaces, so a literal tab in source is a stray.
 *
 * Usage: deno run --allow-read --allow-run=git ./tasks/check-control-characters.ts
