/**
 * Adopt an externally captured space snapshot as a pinned vintage fixture.
 *
 * The capture side of this runs OUT of process — in a git worktree at an old
 * revision, under that revision's own toolchain — precisely because the store
 * it produces holds source closures the current toolchain may no longer
 * compile (`docs/specs/pattern-update-testing.md`, "Adopting an externally
 * captured fixture"). This tool is the current-tree half: it opens the
 * snapshot (running the memory migration chain, as reopening any old space
 * does), re-derives the recorded root from its capture cause, verifies the
 * root's stored `patternIdentity` matches what the capture reported, writes
 * the in-store manifest and restore-control doc, and emits a normal pinned
 * fixture.
 *
 * The root is derived from CAUSE rather than taken as an id argument: entity
 * ids are cause-derived and stable across revisions, so a derivation that
 * lands on a cell with the wrong (or no) stored identity fails the adopt
 * loudly instead of minting a fixture whose manifest addresses nothing.
 *
 * An adopt the tool accepts must be a replay the gate accepts — the same
 * invariant `captureVintage` holds. So before writing anything it applies the
 * replay's own predicates to the entry it is about to record: the main path
 * must map to a pattern key (`patternKeyFromMain`), the entry must be an
 * upgrade target (`isUpgradeTarget`), and today's source for that key must
 * resolve and compile. Without these, a mistyped argument mints a pinned
 * fixture whose every replay fails — the dead end the capture guard exists to
 * prevent, one tool over.
