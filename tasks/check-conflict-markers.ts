#!/usr/bin/env -S deno run --allow-read --allow-run=git
//
// Fails when a tracked file contains an unresolved merge-conflict marker.
//
// A conflict resolved by hand can leave its markers behind, and nothing else
// here notices. `deno fmt` does not treat them as an error in Markdown, and
// `deno.jsonc` excludes `docs/` from `deno fmt` entirely, so a document under
// `docs/` has no other mechanical gate at all. In source they usually break the
// type check, but only because they usually happen to be syntactically invalid
// -- that is luck, not a guarantee.
//
// The case this exists for is the one no per-commit diff shows: an EVIL MERGE,
// where the resolution introduces content present in the merge result and in
// neither parent. `git log -S` finds nothing, because no commit added the line;
// the merge did. Reviewing every commit of a branch can miss it entirely.
//
// Usage: deno run --allow-read --allow-run=git ./tasks/check-conflict-markers.ts

/**
 * The markers git writes: the opener, the `diff3` common-ancestor separator,
 * and the closer.
 *
 * Written out rather than built. Detection is anchored at column 0, so these
 * are inert where they sit -- and this file being tracked and scanned by its
 * own check is a standing demonstration of exactly that. The one rule is that
 * no line here may BEGIN with one, which the check itself enforces.
 *
 * The `=======` separator is deliberately absent: seven equals signs are also
 * how Markdown underlines a setext heading, and a check that fails on those is
 * one people learn to route around. A real conflict brings an opener and a
 * closer anyway.
