/**
 * Fails when a slot the CLI accepts has not been decided about for completion.
 *
 * Completion trails the command surface, and it does so silently. The resolver
 * walks the live Cliffy tree, so a new subcommand or flag becomes completable
 * the moment it is registered; its VALUES do not, because they come from two
 * hand-maintained tables. A command reaching the tree with no entry in either
 * is indistinguishable at the prompt from one whose fabric is unreachable —
 * both offer nothing — so the drift never announces itself.
 *
 * Both provider tables answer in command paths, and both are derivable from
 * the same tree the resolver walks: a positional entry is keyed by
 * `<command path>:<argument name>`, and an option entry carries the commands
 * its provider answers on wherever it answers on some of them. So the drift is
 * machine-detectable, in three directions:
 *
 * - A slot with no provider, no enumerated set, and no allowlist entry.
 * - A provider entry matching no slot on the tree — the same subtraction run
 *   the other way, which is what found `log-file` and `state-path` belonging
 *   to commands that declare no Cliffy options at all.
 * - An allowlist entry that decides no slot, so the record of a decision
 *   cannot outlive the thing it was about.
 *
 * A slot is one option ON one command, not one option name: `--from` is a
 * snapshot file on `space clone` and a sequence number on `inspect diff`, and
 * a provider for the first says nothing about the second.
 *
 * What this cannot decide is whether a slot SHOULD complete — plenty should
 * not. What it requires is that every slot has been decided about, which is
 * what the allowlists record. That turns the next command's completion from
 * something remembered into something the gate asks for.
 *
 * Usage: deno task check-completion-slots
 *        deno task check-completion-slots --list   # every undecided slot
