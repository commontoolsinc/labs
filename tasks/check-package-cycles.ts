/**
 * Fails CI when the workspace packages import each other in a circle.
 *
 * A package cycle is two or more packages that can each reach the other by
 * following imports. It is worth a gate of its own because it defeats the
 * stack that AGENTS.md describes under "Pace Layers": a package in a cycle
 * cannot be read, tested, replaced, or reasoned about without its partner, so
 * the two are one package wearing two names. A cycle also hides which side owns
 * a concept, which is how a user-interface primitive ends up wired into the
 * foundation.
 *
 * The check builds a graph whose nodes are workspace members and whose edges
 * are the imports between them, finds every group of members that can reach
 * each other, and compares that set against the ALLOWLIST below. A group that
 * is not on the list fails. So does an allowlisted group that has gained or
 * lost a member, and so does an allowlisted group that is no longer a cycle at
 * all — the list may only shrink, and an entry that has been fixed has to go.
 *
 * Scope is production source. A test reaches for whatever it needs to drive the
 * thing under test — a runner test starts a toolshed server, a package's own
 * integration tests import the harness that runs them — and treating that as a
 * layering claim would collapse most of the workspace into one group and say
 * nothing. Excluded, therefore: any file under a `test`, `tests`, `integration`,
 * or `bench` directory inside a package, and any file named `*.test.*` or
 * `*.bench.*` wherever it sits, which is how `packages/ui` and
 * `packages/patterns` keep a test beside its subject.
 *
 * An edge is one file naming another package, either by package name
 * (`@commonfabric/runner`, or a subpath export of it) or by a relative path
 * that climbs out of its own package (`../../runner/src/cell.ts`). Both spell
 * the same dependency, and the second is common enough here that ignoring it
 * would leave a hole. Which package a file or a specifier belongs to is decided
 * by the workspace member list rather than by the shape of the path, because
 * neither follows from the other. A member's directory name is not its package
 * name — `packages/background-piece-service` publishes
 * `@commonfabric/background-piece` — and a member can sit inside another
 * member's directory, as `packages/connectors/agents` does, so the longest
 * matching member owns a file rather than the first path segment.
 *
 * A type-only import counts. It disappears before the code runs, so it cannot
 * deadlock a module graph, but it still means one package's source cannot be
 * understood without the other's, which is the property this check is about.
 *
 * Matching is textual, so a package name inside a comment or a string reads as
 * an import. That can only invent an edge, never hide one: a false edge shows
 * up as a cycle that has to be explained, where a missed edge would let a real
 * one through unseen.
 *
 * Usage: deno run --allow-read --allow-run=git ./tasks/check-package-cycles.ts
