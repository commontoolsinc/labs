/**
 * A lint rule that stops a file from naming its own package in an import.
 *
 * A workspace package is meant to be named from outside it. From inside, the
 * name resolves through the package's `exports` map and lands back on a file
 * that a relative specifier would have reached directly. Two things follow, and
 * the rule reports both:
 *
 *   - The bare package name is the entry point, and the entry point reaches
 *     every module the package exports. Naming it from inside adds the edge
 *     back, so the module graph gains a cycle. When the import brings in a
 *     value rather than a type that cycle is there at run time, and the order
 *     in which the modules of the package initialize starts to depend on the
 *     order in which the entry point lists its exports.
 *   - A subpath such as `@scope/pkg/thing` names one module rather than the
 *     whole package, so it adds no cycle. It still leaves the package and comes
 *     back, so the same file arrives under two spellings, and the shorter one
 *     stops being a reliable way to find who depends on what.
 *
 * The rule reads every form that names a module: the `import` and `export ...
 * from` declarations, a dynamic `import()`, and a type written
 * `import("...").Name`. That last one is reported for completeness rather than
 * because it is expected — `cf-imports/no-inline-type-import` rejects the form
 * outright, so one reaches here only in a file that has suppressed that rule.
 *
 * A file under a package's `test/`, `integration/`, or `bench/` directory is
 * exempt, as is one named `*.test.ts` or `*.bench.ts` anywhere in the package;
 * `test-files.ts` is what draws that line. A test that names its own package
 * is reaching for the surface a consumer sees, which is the thing it is there
 * to check.
 *
 * See docs/development/DEVELOPMENT.md.
