/**
 * The compactor: rewrites each closed day of raw records as a handful of
 * rollup shards under the dataset's aggregated/ area, so full-history
 * consumers read a few objects per day plus the recent raw tail instead of
 * every object ever written. Rollups are write-once — a day is compacted
 * only after it has closed, its object names are deterministic, and an
 * existing shard is never touched — so re-running is idempotent and the
 * bucket's versioning never accumulates noncurrent copies.
 *
 * A day is many objects. A busy day is over a gigabyte of NDJSON, against
 * V8's maximum string length of about half that, and an object has to fit
 * in a string at both ends: the compactor builds one, and a reader fetches
 * one. Each shard is sized to fit, which also bounds what the compactor
 * holds — one shard's compressed bytes plus the raw objects its bounded
 * read-ahead window has in flight.
 *
 * Which shard an object belongs to is a hash of its name, so the partition
 * is a property of the object rather than of the order objects were read
 * in. How many shards there are is fixed by an object created before any
 * of them, so a day is partitioned once however many runs reach it, and a
 * run that dies part way is completed by the next one, which writes the
 * shards that are missing and leaves the rest alone. The count is in every
 * shard's name as well, so a shard says which partition it belongs to. The
 * manifest is written last, and a day counts as compacted when it exists.
 *
 * Reader-side validation lives here: every line of every raw object goes
 * through the schema validators, and only what validated reaches a shard.
 *
 *   deno task test-records-compact [--days N] [--plan]
 *
 * `--plan` reports from the listing alone and reads no object bodies, so it
 * says what a day would come to at any volume. What it cannot say is
 * whether a day's objects hold any records, which is a property of their
 * contents; a day of records-free objects shows as compactable and is then
 * left open by the run that reads it.
 *
 * The writer credential comes from CF_TEST_RECORDS_COMPACTOR_KEY_FILE, a
 * service-account key with create-only access to the aggregated/ area;
 * that principal is provisioned in the infra repository when compaction
 * is turned on. Until then the compactor runs read-only with --plan.
