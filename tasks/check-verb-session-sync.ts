/**
 * Fails when a verb-session document drifts from the demo that runs it.
 *
 * Each document is paired with the demo that runs the session it describes —
 * the tour and the walkthrough with `verb-session-demo.sh`, the bulk tour with
 * `bulk-ops-demo.sh`, the read/write tour with `read-write-demo.sh` — and a
 * document may QUOTE its demo's commands but never
 * compose them: every `cf` line in one of its command blocks must be a command
 * that demo actually runs, or sit under a `# not in the demo` comment saying
 * why it cannot be. Nothing
 * executes a command block in a document, so a composed example can be wrong
 * from the day it is written and stay wrong through every editing pass — one
 * shipped that way and survived four of them. Both documents also name demo
 * acts by number, and those references have gone stale twice as acts were
 * inserted. Both failure classes are mechanical to detect, and this is where
 * they are detected.
 *
 * Three checks, run over every document in `DOC_PATHS`:
 * - Every `cf` command matches a demo command, token for token, after
 *   normalization: an `-s <space>` pair is dropped from both sides, quotes
 *   are stripped, and a token holding a `$variable` or a `<placeholder>`
 *   matches anything. An address a transcript shortened for width needs no
 *   rule of its own: the demo holds every address in a variable.
 * - Every "act N" reference, in any case, names an act the demo has.
 * - Every row of a verb shape table pairs its verbs with acts whose demo
 *   text actually mentions them.
 *
 * A `bash` block holds commands alone; a `console` block holds a transcript,
 * and its output lines fall out because they carry no `cf` token.
 *
 * Usage: deno run --allow-read ./tasks/check-verb-session-sync.ts
