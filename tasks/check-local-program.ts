/**
 * Fails when a `FileSystemProgramResolver` is constructed outside the one
 * operation that builds a program from local files.
 *
 * A program assembled by hand -- `resolve(new FileSystemProgramResolver(...))`
 * -- is complete in every way a compiler or a type checker can see. What it
 * silently lacks is any data file the caller meant to attach, and that absence
 * surfaces nowhere until a pattern calls `dataFile()` and is told the file is
 * not there. Three separate rounds of exactly that produced this check: the
 * warm load path, the multi-user test worker, and every pattern integration
 * harness. Each time the code was correct on its own terms and wrong only in
 * what it had no reason to remember.
 *
 * `resolveLocalProgram` composes resolution and attachment into one call, so a
 * new call site cannot take one without the other. This check is what keeps
 * that the only route: reaching for the resolver directly is the mistake, and
 * it is caught here rather than in a pattern that reads a file months later.
 *
 * Detection is on the resolver's name anywhere in code, not on a `new`
 * expression. Constructing it through an alias or a namespace import spells the
 * construction differently but still names it to import it, so the name is the
 * one spelling every route shares.
 *
 * Usage: deno run --allow-read --allow-env --allow-run=git \
 *        ./tasks/check-local-program.ts
