/**
 * PR Coverage Check
 *
 * Runs as a PR CI job after all test jobs complete. Joins the coverage
 * profiles every test job uploaded and gates the PR on coverage debt: for each
 * source group the PR changed, the count of uncovered lines must not rise above
 * the count from the `main` run for the base-branch commit this run merged,
 * unless the PR description accepts the increase. Fails (exit 1) when a changed
 * group regresses, and when the workflow's run listing, which is where that
 * `main` run is found, turns out not to be current. A changed group with no
 * baseline to be held against passes, and the run says so wherever it reports.
 *
 * Environment:
 *   GITHUB_TOKEN        - Required.
 *   GITHUB_REPOSITORY   - Optional, defaults to "commonfabric/labs".
 *   GITHUB_SERVER_URL   - Optional, defaults to "https://github.com".
 *   GITHUB_RUN_ID       - Required. Current workflow run ID.
 *   PR_NUMBER           - Required. Pull request number.
 *   COVERAGE_ARTIFACTS_DIR - Optional. Directory containing downloaded

 * exactly the base-branch code this run merged, leaving the pull request as the
 * only difference between the two numbers. It is often available, but a run
 * still going or one that failed leaves the nearest ancestor with a usable run
 * standing in for it. Whatever the base branch changed in between is then in
 * this run and not in the baseline, so `isComparableBaseline()` withholds
 * gating from the groups it touched. A run for a commit that is not an ancestor
 * is never a baseline: it landed after this run started, so it measured code
 * this run does not contain.
 *
 * A non-cold run wins: a cold run covers cold-compile-only branches, and its
 * lower debt would hold a warm pull request to an unreachable bar. When every
 * ancestor is cold the nearest one stands, so a metric never loses its baseline
 * to coldness alone.
 *
 * A merged pull request that accepted a metric's debt, with a per-group
 * acceptance or the whole-coverage reset marker, sets the floor: its own run is
 * the oldest baseline the ratchet may reach for that metric, so the accepted
 * level is what later runs are held to and nothing older undoes it. Only a run
 * that both carries the acceptance and measured the metric stops the walk —
 * an acceptance whose run uploaded no baseline artifact leaves the search to
 * continue past it. An acceptance that merged onto a commit this run does not
 * contain sets no floor here, for the same reason such a run is no baseline.
 *
 * Runs are read one at a time in the order `baselineWalkOrder()` gives, and the
 * walk stops as soon as every metric has its baseline, so a run that measured
 * every metric is the only one read. When the runs in hand are spent first, the
 * walk asks `olderRuns()` for the next page and carries on with those too. It
 * gives up after `maxRunsRead` runs, so a metric no `main` run has measured
 * costs a bounded number of reads.
 *
 * The order holds across pages, not only within one. A page further back holds
 * runs created earlier, which are usually the ones for commits further from the
 * base-branch commit, but two pushes landing together can have their runs
 * created in the other order, and a page boundary can fall between them. So
 * before the walk reads the run for an ancestor, every commit nearer the
 * base-branch commit has to be accounted for: its run already read, or
 * `accountedFor()` saying the listing has shown a run for it. Until then the
 * walk asks for older pages, and it takes what it has once there are none. A
 * commit with no run at all therefore costs the rest of the page budget, on the
 * runs that have to look past it.
